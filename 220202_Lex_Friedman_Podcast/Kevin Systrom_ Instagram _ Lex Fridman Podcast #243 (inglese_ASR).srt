00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,919
kevin systrom co-founder and long-time

3
00:00:04,719 --> 00:00:09,359
ceo of instagram including for six years

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:10,799
after facebook's acquisition of

5
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:13,279
instagram

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,440

00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,439
in the description

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,399
and now here's my conversation with

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,920
kevin

11
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,839
systrom

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,080
at the risk of uh asking the rolling

13
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:28,240
stones to play satisfaction let me ask

14
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,038
you about the origin story of instagram

15
00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,118
sure

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,880
so maybe some context you

17
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:34,640
like we were talking about offline grew

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,640
up in massachusetts

19
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,558
learned computer programming there liked

20
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,960
to play doom two

21
00:00:38,558 --> 00:00:42,718
uh worked at a vinyl record store then

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,960
you went to stanford

23
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,120
turned down mr uh

24
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,878
mark zuckerberg and facebook

25
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,599
went to florence to study photography

26
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:54,718
those are just some random beautiful

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,640
impossibly brief glimpses into a life so

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,558
let me ask again can you take me through

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,759
the origin story of instagram giving

30
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:04,000
that context you basically set it up um

31
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:06,079
all right so uh we have a fair amount of

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,760
time so i'll go into some detail but

33
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,039
basically what i'll say is

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,760
um

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,360
instagram started out of a company

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,080
actually called bourbon

37
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:17,438
and it was spelled b-u-r-b-n

38
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,719
and uh

39
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,519
a couple things were happening at the

40
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:22,719
time so if we zoom back to 2010 not a

41
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:26,560
lot of people remember what was

42
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:27,359
happening in the dot-com world then uh

43
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,359
but

44
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,680
check-in apps were all the rage

45
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,239
so what's this checking out uh gowalla

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,400
four square hot potato

47
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:37,679
so i'm at a place i'm gonna tell the

48
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,840
world that i'm at this place that's

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,840
right what's what's the idea behind this

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,000
kind of app by the way you know what i'm

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,840
gonna answer that but through

52
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,920
what instagram became and why i believe

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,439
instagram replaced them

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,960
so the whole idea was to share with the

55
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:52,559
world what you were doing specifically

56
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:53,679
with your friends right

57
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,799
um

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,399
but they were all the rage and

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:57,920
foursquare was getting all the press and

60
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,280
i remember sitting around saying hey i

61
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,280
want to build something but i don't know

62
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
what i want to build what if i built a

63
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,159
better

64
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,478
version of foursquare

65
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,239
and i asked myself

66
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,520
why don't i like foursquare or how could

67
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:10,640
it be improved

68
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,120
um

69
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:15,759
and basically i sat down and i said i

70
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,759
think that if you have a few extra

71
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:19,280
features it might be enough one of which

72
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,159
happened to be posting a photo of where

73
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
you were

74
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,318
there were some others it turns out that

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,318
wasn't enough my co-founder joined we

76
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,000
were going to attack uh you know

77
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:29,679
foursquare and the likes and and try to

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
build something interesting

79
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,280
um and no one used it no one cared

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,599
because it wasn't enough it wasn't it

81
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,280
wasn't different enough right

82
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:39,759
so one day we were sitting down and we

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,719
asked ourselves okay let's come to jesus

84
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,959
moment

85
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,280
are we going to do this startup

86
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,640
and if we're going to we can't do what

87
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
we're currently doing we have to switch

88
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,719
it up so what do people love the most so

89
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,719
we sat down and we wrote out

90
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,120
three things that we thought people

91
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:57,039
uniquely loved about our product that

92
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,280
weren't in other products

93
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,359
photos happened to be the top one so

94
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,519
sharing a photo of what you were doing

95
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,640
where you were at the moment was not

96
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,200
something

97
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,518
products let you do really facebook was

98
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:12,318
like post an album of your vacation from

99
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,560
two weeks ago right twitter allowed you

100
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:16,318
to post a photo but their feed was

101
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,080
primarily text and they didn't show the

102
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:19,598
photo in line or at least i don't think

103
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,480
they did at the time

104
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:22,799
so

105
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,439
even though it seems totally

106
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,120
stupid and obvious to us now at the

107
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:28,639
moment then

108
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,000
posting a photo of what you were doing

109
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:32,798
at the moment was like not a thing

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,479
so

111
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,400
we decided to go after that because we

112
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:37,759
noticed that people who used our service

113
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,080
the one thing they happened to like the

114
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,679
most was posting a photo

115
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,599
so that was the beginning of instagram

116
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
and yes like we went through and we

117
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,199
added filters and there's a bunch of

118
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:48,798
stories around that but the origin of

119
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,639
this was that we were trying to be a

120
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,239
checking app realized that no one wanted

121
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,318
another checking app

122
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,840
it became a photo sharing app but one

123
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,359
that was much more about what you're

124
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,959
doing and where you are

125
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,879
and that's why when i say i think we've

126
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,920
replaced checkin apps

127
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,878
it became a check-in via a photo rather

128
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:07,518
than

129
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,280
saying your location and then optionally

130
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,438
adding a photo when you were thinking

131
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,438
about what people like

132
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,759
from where did you get a sense that this

133
00:04:13,438 --> 00:04:18,959
is what people like you you said we sat

134
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,199
down we wrote some stuff down on paper

135
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,199
where is that intuition that seems

136
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,800
fundamental to the success

137
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,759
of

138
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,439
an app like instagram what is that idea

139
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,360
where's that list of three things come

140
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,959
from exactly

141
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,520
only after having studied machine

142
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,439
learning now for a couple of years

143
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,439
i like i have a you have understood

144
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,240
yourself

145
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:44,000
i've started to make connections like we

146
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,120
can go into this later but

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,079
obviously the the um

148
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,680
the connections between

149
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,680
machine learning and the human brain i

150
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,759
think are stretched sometimes right

151
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,000
at the same time

152
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,960
being able to backprop and being able to

153
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,120
like look at the world try something

154
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:04,079
figure out how you're wrong how wrong

155
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,478
you are

156
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:07,918
and then nudge your company in the right

157
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,399
direction

158
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:13,120
based on how wrong you are is like a

159
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:14,560
fascinating concept right and i don't we

160
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,918
didn't know we were doing it at the time

161
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,959
but that's basically what we were doing

162
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,719
right

163
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,399
we put it out to call it a hundred

164
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,800
people

165
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,638
and you would look at their data you

166
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,400
would say what are they sharing

167
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,600
what like what resonates what doesn't

168
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,519
resonate we think they're going to

169
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,960
resonate with x but turns out they

170
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,439
resonate with y

171
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,120
okay shift the company towards y

172
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,319
and it turns out if you do that enough

173
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,079
quickly enough you can get to a solution

174
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,519
that has product market fit most

175
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,439
companies fail

176
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,359
because they sit there and they don't

177
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,879
either their learning rate's too slow

178
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,160
they sit there and they're just they're

179
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,600
adamant that they're right even though

180
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,560
the data is telling them they're not

181
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,600
right

182
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,199
or

183
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,120
they their learning rate's too high and

184
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,680
they wildly chase different ideas and

185
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,600
they never actually set on on one where

186
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,038
where they don't groove right and i

187
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,360
think when we sat down and we wrote out

188
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,599
those three ideas what we were saying is

189
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,160
what are the three possible

190
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,479
whether they're local or global maxima

191
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,720
in our world right

192
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,918
that users are telling us they like

193
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
because they're using the product that

194
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:16,318
way

195
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,360
it was clear people liked the photos

196
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,560
because that was the thing they were

197
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,639
doing

198
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
and we just said okay like what if we

199
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,400
just cut out most of the other stuff and

200
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,079
focus on that thing

201
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,719
um and then it happened to be a

202
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,279
multi-billion dollar business and

203
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,440
it's that easy by the way yeah i guess

204
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,879
so um well nobody ever writes about

205
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,120
neural networks that

206
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,800
miserably failed so this this particular

207
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,120
neural network succeeded this is the

208
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,759
sound all the time right yeah but nobody

209
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,160
right default state is failing yes

210
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,240
um when you said the way people are

211
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,160
using the app

212
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,800
is that the lost function for this

213
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,479
neural network or is it also self-report

214
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
like do you ever ask people what they

215
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,560
like or do you have to

216
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,840
track exactly what they're doing not

217
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,038
what they're saying

218
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,079
i once made a thanksgiving dinner okay

219
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:05,918
and

220
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:08,959
uh it was for

221
00:07:05,918 --> 00:07:10,959
relatives and i like to cook a lot okay

222
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:12,239
and i worked really hard on picking the

223
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,560
specific

224
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,319
uh dishes and

225
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,399
and i was really proud because i had

226
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,319
planned it out using a gantt chart and

227
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,159
like it was ready on time and everything

228
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,598
was hot nice like i don't know if you're

229
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,520
a big thanksgiving guy but like the

230
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:27,279
worst thing about thanksgiving

231
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,198
is when the turkey is cold and some

232
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:30,879
things are hot and something anyway you

233
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,520
got a gantt chart you actually have a

234
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,159
chart oh yeah yeah omni plan fairly

235
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,799
expensive like gantt chart thing that i

236
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,560
think maybe 10 people have purchased

237
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,639
in the world but i'm one of them and i

238
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,759
use it for recipe planning only around

239
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:48,000
big holidays that's brilliant by the way

240
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,080
do people do this kind of uh over

241
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,079
engineering it's not overdue it's just

242
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,839
engineering it's planning thanksgiving

243
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,758
is a complicated uh

244
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,758
set of events with some uncertainty with

245
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,680
a lot of things going on you should be

246
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,598
able you should be planning in this way

247
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,759
there should be a chart it's not over i

248
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:06,719
mean so what's funny is um

249
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,639
brief aside yes uh brilliant i love

250
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,400
cooking i love food i love coffee and

251
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,199
i've spent some time with some chefs who

252
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,719
like know their stuff and

253
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,439
they always just take out a piece of

254
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,680
paper and just work backwards in rough

255
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,759
order like it's never perfect but rough

256
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,759
order it's just like oh that makes sense

257
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,199
why not just work backwards from from

258
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,720
the end goal right and put in some

259
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,800
buffer time and

260
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,680
so i probably overspecified it a bit

261
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:33,440
using a gantt chart but the fact that

262
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
you can do it it's what professional

263
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,800
kitchens roughly do

264
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,799
they just don't call it a gantt chart or

265
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,240
at least i don't think they do um anyway

266
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,718
i was telling a story about thanksgiving

267
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,639
so here's uh here's the thing

268
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,000
i'm sitting down we have the meal and

269
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,319
then i'm

270
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,720
you know i got to know ray dalio

271
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,959
fairly well over maybe the last year of

272
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,800
instagram um

273
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:57,919
and one thing that he kept saying was

274
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,759
like feedback is really hard to get

275
00:08:57,919 --> 00:09:01,439
honestly from people

276
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,600
and i sat down at

277
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,399
after dinner i said guys i want feedback

278
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,639
what was good and what was bad yes and

279
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,958
what's funny is like literally everyone

280
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:13,120
just said everything was great

281
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,879
and i like personally knew i had screwed

282
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,440
up a handful of things

283
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,439
um but no one would say it

284
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,720
and can you imagine now

285
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,399
not something as high stakes as

286
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,879
thanksgiving dinner okay thanksgiving

287
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,320
dinner it's not that high stakes

288
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,240
but you're trying to build a product and

289
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,600
everyone knows you left your job for it

290
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,839
you're trying to build it out and you're

291
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,440
trying to make something wonderful

292
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,760
and it's yours right you designed it

293
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,440
now try asking for feedback

294
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:42,159
and know that you're giving this to your

295
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,440
friends and your family

296
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:47,759
people have trouble giving hard feedback

297
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,000
people have trouble saying

298
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,919
i don't like this or this isn't great or

299
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,360
this is how it's failed me

300
00:09:51,919 --> 00:09:54,559
in fact

301
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,480
um

302
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,799
you usually have two classes of people

303
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,120
people who just won't say bad things you

304
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,399
can literally say to them please tell me

305
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,440
what you hate most about this and they

306
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,879
won't do it they'll try but they won't

307
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,519
and then the other class of people are

308
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:12,078
just negative period about everything

309
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,720
and it's hard to parse out

310
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:16,879
like what is true and what isn't

311
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,920
so my rule of thumb with this

312
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,759
is you should always ask people

313
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,278
but at the end of the day it's amazing

314
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,958
what data will tell you

315
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,120
and that's why with whatever project i

316
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:28,639
work on even now

317
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,919
collecting data from the beginning on

318
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:34,159
usage patterns so engagement how many

319
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,838
days of the week do they use it

320
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,519
how many i don't know if we were to go

321
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,560
back to instagram how many impressions

322
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,959
per day

323
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:43,199
right is that growing is that shrinking

324
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,199
and don't be like overly

325
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,160
scientific about it right because maybe

326
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,720
you have 50 beta users or something

327
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,639
but what's fascinating is that

328
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,879
data doesn't lie

329
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,439
people are very

330
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,519
uh defensive about their time

331
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,680
they'll say oh i'm so busy i'm sorry i

332
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,278
didn't get to use the app like i'm just

333
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,639
you know um

334
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,120
but i don't know you're posting on

335
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,000
instagram the whole time

336
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,360
so

337
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,120
i don't know at the end of the day like

338
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,278
at facebook there was

339
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,799
you know before time spent became

340
00:11:13,278 --> 00:11:16,559
kind of this loaded

341
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,240
term there

342
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,879
the idea that people

343
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,320
people's currency in their lives is time

344
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:24,159
and they only have a certain amount of

345
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,240
time to give things whether it's friends

346
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:27,360
or family or apps or tv shows or

347
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,879
whatever it's

348
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:32,000
there's no way of inventing more of it

349
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,000
at least not that i know of

350
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:35,518
if they don't use it it's because it's

351
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,879
not great

352
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,959
so

353
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,399
the moral of the story is you can ask

354
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,679
all you want but you just have to look

355
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,679
at the data

356
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,759
and

357
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:49,199
data doesn't lie right i mean there's

358
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:52,559
metrics there's uh

359
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,440
data can obscure the key insight if

360
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:57,759
you're not careful so

361
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,360
so time spent in the app that's ones

362
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,879
there's so many metrics you can put at

363
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,399
this and they will give you totally

364
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:03,838
different insights

365
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,399
especially when you're trying to create

366
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,600
something that doesn't obviously exist

367
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,679
yet

368
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,720
so

369
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,799
you know

370
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,278
measuring maybe

371
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,879
why you left the app or measuring

372
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,559
special moments

373
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,720
of happiness that will make sure you

374
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,638
return to the app or moments of

375
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,959
happiness that are long lasting versus

376
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,200
like dopamine short term

377
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,759
all of those things but i think i

378
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,519
suppose in the beginning

379
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,120
you can just get away with just asking

380
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,759
the question

381
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
which features are used a lot let's do

382
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:40,639
more of that

383
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,639
and how hard was the decision

384
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,480
and uh i mean maybe you can tell me what

385
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,480
instagram looked in the beginning but

386
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,560
how hard was it to make

387
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,320
pictures the first class citizen that's

388
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:53,039
a revolutionary idea

389
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,959
like um at whatever point instagram

390
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,838
became this feed

391
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,879
of

392
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,399
photos

393
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,240
that's quite brilliant

394
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,639
plus

395
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,519
i also don't know when this happened but

396
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,600
they're all shaped the same

397
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,399
it's like uh i have to tell you why

398
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:14,159
that's the interesting part

399
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,159
why is that so a couple of things one is

400
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,199
data data like you're right you can over

401
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,639
interpret data like imagine trying to

402
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,639
fly a plane

403
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,399
by staring at

404
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,519
i don't know a single metric like

405
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,639
airspeed

406
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,240
you don't know if you're going up or

407
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,079
down i mean it correlates with up or

408
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
down but you don't actually know it will

409
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:34,239
never help you land the plane

410
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,159
so don't stare at one metric like it

411
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,399
turns out you have to synthesize a bunch

412
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:40,559
of metrics to know where to go

413
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,639
um but it doesn't lie like if your air

414
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:44,719
speed is zero unless it's not working

415
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,839
right if if it's zero

416
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,440
you're probably going to fall out of the

417
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,959
sky so

418
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
generally you look around and you have

419
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:53,198
the scan going yes

420
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,198
and you're just asking yourself is this

421
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:56,159
working or is this not working

422
00:13:55,198 --> 00:14:00,799
um

423
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,639
but people have trouble explaining

424
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,799
how they actually feel

425
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,919
so just it's about synthesizing both of

426
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,719
them so then instagram right uh we were

427
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,479
talking about revolutionary moment where

428
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,440
where the feed became

429
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,879
square photos basically and photos first

430
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:23,600
and then square footage yeah um

431
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:23,600
it was clear to me that the biggest so

432
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,799
i believe the biggest companies are

433
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,839
founded

434
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,879
when

435
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,720
enormous technical shifts happen and the

436
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:35,039
biggest technical shift that happened

437
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,839
right before instagram was founded was

438
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,759
the advent of a phone that didn't suck

439
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,440
the iphone right like in retrospect

440
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,958
we're like oh my god the first iphone

441
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,399
that almost had

442
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,399
like it wasn't that good

443
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,519
but compared to everything else at the

444
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,799
time it was

445
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,360
amazing

446
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:54,639
and by the way the first

447
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,879
phone that had an incredible camera

448
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,159
that could that could like do as well as

449
00:14:56,879 --> 00:14:59,679
the point and shoot you might carry

450
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:02,000
around

451
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,919
was the iphone 4 and that was right when

452
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,159
instagram launched and we looked around

453
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,399
and we said what will change because

454
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:11,278
everyone has a camera in their pocket

455
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,399
and it was so clear to me that the the

456
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,799
world of

457
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,198
social networks before

458
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:19,359
it was based in the desktop and sitting

459
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:20,559
there and having a link you could share

460
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,759
right

461
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:23,439
and that wasn't going to be the case so

462
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:26,799
the question is what would you share if

463
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,880
you were out and about in the world

464
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,078
if not only did you have a camera that's

465
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:32,000
in your pocket but by the way that

466
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:34,638
camera had a network attached to it that

467
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,480
allowed you to share instantly

468
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,000
that seemed revolutionary and a bunch of

469
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,278
people saw it at the same time it wasn't

470
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,198
just instagram there were a bunch of

471
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,879
competitors

472
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,799
the thing we did

473
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,720
i think was not only well we focused on

474
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,399
two things so we wrote down those things

475
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,839
we circled photos and we said i think we

476
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,720
should invest in this

477
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:56,079
but then we said what sucks about photos

478
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:58,480
one they look like crap right they just

479
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,719
at least back then now

480
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,519
my phone takes pretty great photos right

481
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,079
um back then they were blurry not so

482
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,879
great compressed right

483
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:08,958
two

484
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:12,000
uh it was really slow

485
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:13,758
like really slow to upload a photo

486
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,440
and i'll tell a fun story about that and

487
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,360
explain to you why they're all the same

488
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
size and square as well

489
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,759
um and three

490
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,839
man if you wanted to share a photo on

491
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,240
different networks you had to go to each

492
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,639
of the individual apps and select all of

493
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,919
them and upload individually and

494
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,000
so we're like all right those are the

495
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:33,599
pain points we're gonna focus on that so

496
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,919
one instead of

497
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,199
because they weren't beautiful um we

498
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:38,479
were like why don't we lean into the

499
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,639
fact that they're not beautiful and i

500
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,320
remember studying in florence my

501
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,600
photography teacher gave me this whole

502
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,959
gay camera and i'm not sure everyone

503
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,240
knows what a whole gay camera is but

504
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:50,000
they're these old-school plastic cameras

505
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,919
i think they're produced in china at the

506
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,440
time

507
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,599
and they're i want to say the original

508
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,639
ones like from the 70s or the 80s or

509
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,079
something they're supposed to be like

510
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,839
three dollar cameras for the every

511
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,039
person

512
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,920
they took nice medium format films large

513
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,038
large

514
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:07,359
negatives

515
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,199
but they kind of blurred the the the

516
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,599
light and they kind of like light leaked

517
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:13,360
into the side and there was this whole

518
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,798
resurgence where people looked at that

519
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,399
and said oh my god this is a style right

520
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:19,759
and i remember using that in florence

521
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,038
and just saying well why don't we just

522
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:24,160
like lean into the fact that these

523
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:26,078
photos suck and make them suck more

524
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,759
but in an artistic way

525
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,359
and it turns out that had product market

526
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,200
fit people really liked that they were

527
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:32,399
willing to share their not so great

528
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,279
photos if they

529
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,519
looked

530
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:37,279
not so great on purpose okay

531
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,119
it's the second part

532
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:41,119
that's the where the filters come into

533
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,759
the picture yeah so computational

534
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,079
modification of photos to make them look

535
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,759
extra crappy to where it becomes art

536
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,639
yeah yeah and

537
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,200
i mean

538
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,880
add light leaks add like an overlay

539
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,440
filter make them more contrasty than

540
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,440
they should be uh the first

541
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,240
filter we ever produced was called x-pro

542
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,240
2. and i designed it while i was in this

543
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,160
small little bed and breakfast room in

544
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,919
total santos mexico i was trying to take

545
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,000
a break from the

546
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,679
the bourbon days and i i remember saying

547
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,960
to my co-founder i just need like a week

548
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,480
to reset

549
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,960
and that was

550
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,558
on that trip worked on the first filter

551
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,519
because i said you know i think i can do

552
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:22,160
this and i literally iterated

553
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,160
one by one over the rgb values in the

554
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,640
array that was the photo

555
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,960
and just slightly shifted basically

556
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,720
there was a function of our function of

557
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,319
g function of b

558
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,880
that just shifted them slightly it

559
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,279
wasn't rocket science um and it turns

560
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,400
out that actually made your photo look

561
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,879
pretty cool

562
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,640
it just mapped from one color space to

563
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,400
another color space

564
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,120
it was simple but it was really slow i

565
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,720
mean if you applied a filter

566
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,399
i think it used to take two or three

567
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,839
seconds to render

568
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,240
only eventually would i figure out how

569
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,480
to do it on the gpu and i'm not even

570
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,200
sure it was gpu but was using opengl but

571
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,519
anyway um i would eventually figure that

572
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,360
out and then it would be instant but it

573
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,918
used to be really slow by the way anyone

574
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,558
who's watching or listening

575
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,240
it's amazing what you can get away with

576
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:14,319
in a startup as long as the product

577
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,640
outcome is right for the user like you

578
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,918
can be slow you can be terrible you can

579
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,960
be

580
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,559
as long as you have product market fit

581
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,840
people will put up with a lot and then

582
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,678
the question is just about compressing

583
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,279
making it more performant over time so

584
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,400
that they get that product market fit

585
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,240
instantly

586
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,600
so fascinating because there's some

587
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,599
things where

588
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,359
those three seconds would

589
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,599
make or break the app

590
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,519
but some things you're saying not it's

591
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,399
hard to know when you know it's what

592
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:46,798
it's the problem spotify solved

593
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,400
making streaming like

594
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:49,200
work

595
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,600
and

596
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,960
like delays in listening to music is a

597
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,519
huge negative

598
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,679
even like slight delays

599
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,960
but here you're saying i mean how do you

600
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,559
know

601
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,880
when those three seconds are okay are

602
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:06,000
you just gonna have to

603
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,200
try it out because to me my intuition

604
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,759
would be

605
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,159
those three seconds would kill the app

606
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:13,200
like i would try to do the opengl thing

607
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,559
right

608
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,519
so i wish i were that smart at the time

609
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,759
um

610
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:21,599
i wasn't i just knew how to do what i

611
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:25,359
knew how to do right

612
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:27,119
and i decided okay like why don't i just

613
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:28,959
iterate over the values and change them

614
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,678
and what's interesting

615
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:33,519
is that um

616
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,880
compared to the alternatives no one else

617
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:36,400
used opengl

618
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,559
right so everyone else was doing that

619
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,519
the dumb way and in fact they were doing

620
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,960
it at a high resolution now comes in the

621
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,158
small resolution that we'll talk about

622
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,960
for a second

623
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,480
um

624
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,798
by choosing 512 pixels by 512 pixels

625
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,279
which i believe it was at the time

626
00:20:50,798 --> 00:20:54,960
we iterated over a lot fewer pixels than

627
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,000
our competitors who were trying to do

628
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,038
these enormous output like images yeah

629
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,119
so instead of taking 20 seconds i mean

630
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,879
three seconds feels pretty good right

631
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,239
so on a relative basis we were winning

632
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,720
like a lot

633
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,640
okay so that's answer number one answer

634
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,319
number two is uh

635
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,919
we actually focused on latency in the

636
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,480
right places so we did this really

637
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,799
wonderful thing um

638
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,720
when you uploaded so uh the way it would

639
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:23,359
work is you know you'd take your phone

640
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,880
you'd take the photo and then you'd go

641
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:26,798
to the um

642
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,640
you'd go the edit screen where you would

643
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,720
caption it

644
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:32,320
and on that caption screen you start

645
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,798
typing you think okay like what's a

646
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:36,399
clever caption and and i said to mike

647
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:38,000
hey when i worked on the gmail team you

648
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,720
know what they did when you typed in

649
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,079
your username or your email address

650
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,360
even before you've entered in your

651
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,279
password like the chat probability once

652
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,839
you enter in your username that you're

653
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:50,960
going to actually sign in is extremely

654
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,240
high

655
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,919
so why not just start loading your

656
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,759
account in the background not not like

657
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,559
sending it down to the desktop that

658
00:21:55,759 --> 00:22:00,879
would be a security uh uh

659
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:03,359
issue but like load it into memory on

660
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,520
the server like get it ready prepare it

661
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:07,918
i always thought that was so fascinating

662
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,359
and unintuitive i was like mike why

663
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,320
don't we just do that but like we'll

664
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:14,319
just upload the photo and like assume

665
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,200
you're gonna upload the photo and if you

666
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,519
don't

667
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,200
forget about it we'll delete it right

668
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,000
so what ended up happening

669
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,480
was people would caption their uh photo

670
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,319
they'd press done or upload

671
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,839
and you'd see this little progress bar

672
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:30,158
just go

673
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:32,480
it was lightning fast okay

674
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,919
we were no faster than anyone else at

675
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,919
the time but by choosing 512 by 512 and

676
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:40,000
doing in the background it almost

677
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,200
guaranteed that it was done by the time

678
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
you captioned

679
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,798
and everyone when they used it was like

680
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,720
how the hell is this thing so fast

681
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,480
but we were slow we just hid the the

682
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,919
slowness it wasn't like

683
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,200
these things are just like it's a shelly

684
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,240
game you're just hiding the latency

685
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,880
that

686
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,960
that mattered to people like a lot and i

687
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:03,679
think that so you were willing to put up

688
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,200
with a slow filter if it meant you could

689
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,038
share it immediately and of course we

690
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,400
added sharing options which let you

691
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:10,079
distribute it really quickly that was

692
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,280
the third part

693
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,480
um

694
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,158
so latency matters but relative to what

695
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,079
and then

696
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,400
there's some like tricks you can get

697
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,480
around to just hiding the latency um

698
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,240
like i don't know if spotify starts

699
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,599
downloading the next song eagerly i'm

700
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,000
assuming they do

701
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:30,158
there are a bunch of ideas here that are

702
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,679
not rocket science that

703
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,679
that really help

704
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,280
and all of that was

705
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,880
stuff you were explicitly having a

706
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:38,558
discussion about like

707
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,120
those designs and argument you were

708
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:43,359
having like arguments discussions

709
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,119
uh i'm sure it was arguments i mean

710
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,599
i'm not sure if you've met my co-founder

711
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,519
mike but he's a pretty nice guy and he's

712
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,798
very reasonable and uh

713
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:52,960
and we both just saw eye to eye and

714
00:23:50,798 --> 00:23:56,400
we're like yeah just like

715
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:58,159
make this fast early seem fast

716
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,679
it'll be great i mean honestly i think

717
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,720
the most contentious thing and he would

718
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,559
say this too initially

719
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:09,038
was um i was on an iphone 3g so like the

720
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:12,399
the not so fast one and he had a brand

721
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:15,200
new iphone 4. i was cheap nice um

722
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:18,640
and his feed loaded super smoothly like

723
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,200
when he would scroll from photo to photo

724
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,799
buttery smooth right but on my phone

725
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,840
every time you got to a new photo it was

726
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:25,839
like

727
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:27,199
a chunk allocate memory like all this

728
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,359
stuff right

729
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,960
i was like mike that's unacceptable he's

730
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:32,879
like oh come on man just like upgrade

731
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,600
your phone basically you didn't actually

732
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,960
say that it's nicer than that um

733
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,558
but i could tell he wished like i would

734
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,440
just stop being cheap and just get a new

735
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:40,879
phone

736
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,360
but what's funny is we actually sat

737
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,880
there working on that little detail for

738
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:49,199
a few days before launch and

739
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,679
that polished experience plus the fact

740
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,240
that uploading seemed fast for all these

741
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,759
people who didn't have nice phones

742
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,960
i think meant a lot

743
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:59,440
because

744
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,400
far too often you see teams focus not on

745
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,000
performance

746
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,840
they focus on

747
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,038
what's the cool computer science problem

748
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,278
they can solve

749
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,440
right can we scale this thing to a

750
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:10,880
billion users and they've got like 100

751
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,640
right

752
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,240
yeah

753
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,600
you talked about loss function so i want

754
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,000
to come back to that

755
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:20,558
but like the loss function is like do

756
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,960
you provide a great happy magical

757
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:24,960
whatever experience for the consumer

758
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,640
and listen if it happens to involve

759
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,519
something complex and technical then

760
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,080
great

761
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:32,158
but it turns out i think most of the

762
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,759
time

763
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,840
those experiences are just sitting there

764
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,079
waiting to be built with like not that

765
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,079
complex solutions

766
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,678
uh but everyone is just like so stuck in

767
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,119
their own head that they have to over

768
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,880
engineer everything and then they forget

769
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,278
about the easy stuff

770
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,720
i mean also maybe to flip the lost

771
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,440
function there is you're trying to

772
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,919
minimize the number of times

773
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,759
you there's unpleasant experience right

774
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:57,440
like uh the one you mention where when

775
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,599
you go to the next photo it freezes for

776
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,440
a little bit so it's almost as opposed

777
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:03,038
to maximizing pleasure it's probably

778
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,640
easier to minimize

779
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:05,759
the number of like

780
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,679
the friction

781
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:09,839
yeah and as we all know you just you

782
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:12,880
just uh you just make the pleasure

783
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,399
negative and then minimize everything so

784
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,919
we're mapping this all back to neural

785
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,840
networks but actually can i say one

786
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,360
thing on that which is

787
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,839
i don't know a lot about machine

788
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:24,479
learning but i feel like i've i've tried

789
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,798
studying a bunch that whole idea of

790
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,360
reinforcement learning

791
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:32,000
and planning out more than the greedy

792
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:35,199
single experience i think is

793
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,480
is the closest you can get to

794
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,880
like ideal product design thinking

795
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,720
where you're not saying hey like can we

796
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,600
have a great experience just this one

797
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,278
time

798
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,359
but like what is the right way to

799
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,919
onboard someone what series of

800
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:53,199
experiences correlate most with them

801
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:55,600
hanging on long term right so not just

802
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,519
saying oh did the photo load slowly a

803
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,918
couple times or did they get a great

804
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,359
photo at the top of their feed

805
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:03,759
but like what are the things that are

806
00:27:01,359 --> 00:27:06,158
going to make this person come back

807
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:07,839
over the next week over the next month

808
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,159
and as a product designer asking

809
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,759
yourself okay i want to optimize not

810
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,240
just minimize bad experiences in the

811
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,158
short run but like

812
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,759
how do i get someone to engage over the

813
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,080
next month

814
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,359
and i'm not going to claim at all that i

815
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,439
thought that way at all at the time

816
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,439
because i certainly didn't but if i were

817
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,038
going back and giving myself any advice

818
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,880
it would be thinking what are those what

819
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:30,158
are those second order effects that you

820
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,840
can create

821
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,120
and it turns out having your friends on

822
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,519
the service

823
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:38,000
it's an enormous win so starting with a

824
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:40,158
very small group of people that produce

825
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,558
content that you wanted to see which we

826
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,679
did we seeded the community very well i

827
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,678
think

828
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,480
ended up mattering and

829
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,159
so

830
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,798
yeah you said that community is one of

831
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,039
the most important things so it's from a

832
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:55,278
metrics perspective from uh maybe a

833
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:56,798
philosophy perspective

834
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,960
building a certain kind of community

835
00:27:56,798 --> 00:28:00,720
within the app see i wasn't sure what

836
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,240
exactly you meant by that when when i've

837
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:05,278
heard you say that maybe you can

838
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,440
elaborate but as i understand now it's

839
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,679
can literally mean

840
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,558
get your friends onto the app

841
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,798
yeah

842
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:15,359
think of it this way

843
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:17,759
you can build an amazing restaurant or

844
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:19,199
bar or whatever right

845
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,759
but if you show up and you're the only

846
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,840
one there is it like does it matter how

847
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:27,119
good the food is

848
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:29,038
the drinks whatever um no um these are

849
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:30,398
inherently social experiences that we

850
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:31,278
were working on

851
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:35,439
so

852
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:38,079
the idea of having people there

853
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,679
like you needed to have that otherwise

854
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,119
it was just to filter out but by the way

855
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,480
part of the genius

856
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,719
i'm going to say genius even though i

857
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,720
wasn't really genius was starting to be

858
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,159
marauding as a filter app

859
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,759
was awesome

860
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,840
the fact that you could so we talk about

861
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,079
single player mode a lot which is like

862
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:57,519
can you play the game alone

863
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,439
and instagram you could totally play

864
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,960
alone you could filter your photos and a

865
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,038
lot of people would tell me i didn't

866
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,399
even realize that this thing was a

867
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:06,720
social network

868
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,558
until my friend showed up it totally

869
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,720
worked as a single player

870
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,398
game and then when your friend showed up

871
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,480
all of a sudden it was like oh

872
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,879
not only was this great alone but now i

873
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,278
actually have this trove of photos that

874
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,039
people can look at and start liking and

875
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:23,599
then i can like theirs and

876
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:25,359
so it was this bootstrap method of how

877
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,879
do you make the thing not suck when the

878
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,558
restaurant is empty

879
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,799
yeah but the thing is when you say

880
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:32,158
friends i mean we're not necessarily

881
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:33,918
referring to friends in the physical

882
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,760
space so you're not bringing your

883
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,520
physical friends with you you're also

884
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:39,359
making new friends so you're finding new

885
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:41,679
community so it's not immediately

886
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,278
obvious to me that

887
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,880
it's like it's almost like building any

888
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,519
kind of community

889
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,600
it was it was both and what we learned

890
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,038
very early on was what made instagram

891
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,959
special and the reason why you would

892
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:55,679
sign up for it versus say just sit on

893
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,440
facebook and look at your friends photos

894
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,720
of course we were live and of course it

895
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,080
was interesting to see what your friends

896
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,600
were doing now

897
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:04,000
but the fact that you could connect with

898
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,678
people who like took really beautiful

899
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,440
photos in a certain style all around the

900
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,440
world whether they were travelers it was

901
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,919
the beginning or beginning of the

902
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,000
influencer economy there's these people

903
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,520
who became professional instagramers way

904
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,480
back when right

905
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,960
um

906
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,079
but they took these amazing photos and

907
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,919
some of them were photographers right um

908
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:25,439
like professionally

909
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,799
and all of a sudden you had this moment

910
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,159
in the day when you could open up this

911
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:29,679
app and sure you could see what your

912
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,600
friends were doing but also it was like

913
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,519
oh my god that's a beautiful beautiful

914
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:36,000
waterfall or oh my god i didn't realize

915
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:37,679
there was that corner of england or like

916
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,558
really cool stuff

917
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,159
um

918
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,000
and the beauty about instagram early on

919
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,480
was that it was

920
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,640
international by default you didn't have

921
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,480
to speak english to use it right you

922
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,600
could just look at the photos

923
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,599
worked great

924
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,278
we did translate we had some pretty bad

925
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,319
translations but we did translate the

926
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:55,519
app

927
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:57,200
and uh

928
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,798
you know even if our translations were

929
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,240
pretty poor the the idea that you could

930
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:03,200
just connect with other people through

931
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,759
their images was pretty powerful

932
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,440
how much uh technical difficulties there

933
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:08,720
with the programming like what

934
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,880
programming language you were talking

935
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,200
about what was zero i'd like maybe it

936
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:17,039
was hard for us but um i mean we

937
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,798
there was nothing the only thing that

938
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:20,480
was complex about instagram at the

939
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,759
beginning

940
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,640
technically was making it scale and we

941
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:26,720
were

942
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,320
just plain old objective c for the

943
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,480
client uh so it was iphone only

944
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:34,158
yep as an android person i'm deeply

945
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,519
offended but go ahead again come on this

946
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:40,399
was 2010. oh sure sure sorry android's

947
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,000
getting a lot better yeah yeah so

948
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:43,518
um i take it back you're right if i were

949
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,599
to do something today i think it would

950
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,960
be very different in terms of launch

951
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:51,519
strategy right android's enormous too uh

952
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,558
but anyway um back to that moment it was

953
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:57,359
objective c uh and then

954
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:59,599
we were python based uh which is just

955
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,599
like this is before python was really

956
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,199
cool like now it's cool because it's all

957
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,199
these machine learning libraries like

958
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,798
support python and right

959
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,159
now it's super

960
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,720
now it's like cool to be by the back

961
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,480
then it was like oh google uses python

962
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,200
like maybe you should use python

963
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:17,038
facebook was php like

964
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,759
i had worked at a small startup of some

965
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:21,919
ex-googlers that used python so we used

966
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:25,200
it and we used a framework called django

967
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,240
uh still exists and people use for

968
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,960
basically

969
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,319
the back end and then you threw a couple

970
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,079
interesting things in there i mean we

971
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:34,000
used postgres which was kind of fun it

972
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:35,519
was a little bit like hipster database

973
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,278
at the time right

974
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,038
my sequel my sequel like everyone used

975
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:41,919
my sequel so like using postcards was

976
00:32:39,038 --> 00:32:44,079
like an interesting decision right uh

977
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:46,000
but we used it because it had a bunch of

978
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,278
uh geo features built in because we

979
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,200
thought we were going to be a checking

980
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:50,960
out pretty much it's also super cool now

981
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,038
so you were into python before it was

982
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,038
cool and you were into postgres before

983
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,720
it was cool yeah we were basically like

984
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,480
not only hipster

985
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,919
hipster photo company hipster tech

986
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,960
company right uh we also adopted redis

987
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:06,880
early and like loved it i mean it solved

988
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,440
so many problems for us

989
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,519
and turns out that's still pretty cool

990
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,919
but the programming was very easy it was

991
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:14,960
like sign up a user have a feed there

992
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,519
was nothing

993
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,759
no machine learning at all zero can you

994
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,599
get some context how many users at each

995
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:24,798
of these stages are we talking about 100

996
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:26,480
users a thousand users so the stage i

997
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:28,960
just described i mean that technical

998
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,360
stack lasted through

999
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,640
probably 50 million users

1000
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,798
um

1001
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,440
i mean seriously like you can get away

1002
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:39,599
with a lot with with a pretty basic

1003
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,840
stack um like i think a lot of startups

1004
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:43,519
try to over engineer their solutions

1005
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:45,519
from the beginning to like really scale

1006
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,679
and you can get away with a lot

1007
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,120
that being said most of the first two

1008
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,360
years of instagram was literally just

1009
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,599
trying to make that stack scale and it

1010
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,839
wasn't it was it was not a python

1011
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:57,519
problem it was like

1012
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,839
literally just like where do we put the

1013
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,359
data like it's all coming in too fast

1014
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:04,879
like how do we store it how do we make

1015
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,158
sure to be up how do we like

1016
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,760
how do we make sure we're on the right

1017
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,280
side of boxes that they have enough

1018
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:13,119
memory um those were the issues but can

1019
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,119
you speak to the choices you make at

1020
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,079
that stage when you're growing so

1021
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,000
quickly

1022
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,960
do you use something like somebody

1023
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,639
else's computer infrastructure or do you

1024
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:25,119
build in-house

1025
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:27,440
i'm only laughing because we when we

1026
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:30,559
launched we had a single

1027
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,480
computer that we had rented

1028
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,559
in some colo space in la i don't even

1029
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,760
remember what it was called

1030
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,358
because i thought that's what you did

1031
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,520
when i worked at a company called odio

1032
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,598
that became twitter i remember visiting

1033
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:43,440
our space in san francisco you walked in

1034
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:44,159
you had to wear the ear things and it

1035
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,720
was

1036
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,960
cold and fans everywhere right

1037
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,039
and we had to you know plug one out

1038
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,559
replace one and i was the intern so i

1039
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:54,320
just like held things

1040
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,000
but i thought to myself oh this is how

1041
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:58,320
it goes and then i remember being in a

1042
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,400
vc's office

1043
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,079
i think it was benchmark's office and i

1044
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,200
think we ran into another entrepreneur

1045
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,200
and they were like oh how are things

1046
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,639
going we're like uh you know trying to

1047
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,639
scale this thing

1048
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,159
and they were like well i mean can't you

1049
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:11,358
just add more instances and i was like

1050
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,598
what do you mean

1051
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,440
and they're like instances on amazon i

1052
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,599
was like what are those

1053
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,920
and it was this moment where we realized

1054
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,599
how deep in it we were because we had no

1055
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,280
idea that aw aws existed nor should we

1056
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,800
be using it anyway

1057
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,960
that night we went back to the office

1058
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,039
and we got on aws but we we did this

1059
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,559
really dumb thing we're

1060
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,880
i'm so sorry to people listening but um

1061
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,719
we brought up an instance which was our

1062
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,720
our database it's going to be a

1063
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:43,118
replacement for our database

1064
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:45,199
but we had it talking over the public

1065
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,240
internet to our little box in la that

1066
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:50,000
was our app server very nice yeah um

1067
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:52,719
that's how sophisticated we were and

1068
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,719
obviously that was very very slow

1069
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,118
didn't work at all i mean it worked but

1070
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:58,639
didn't work did we only like later that

1071
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,000
night did we realize we had to have it

1072
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:01,679
all together

1073
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,838
but at least like if you're listening

1074
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,118
right now and you're thinking you know i

1075
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:06,799
have no chance i'm going to start to

1076
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,240
start i have no chance

1077
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,480
i don't know we did it and we made a

1078
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,000
bunch of really dumb mistakes initially

1079
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:13,440
i think the question is how quickly do

1080
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,960
you learn that you're making a mistake

1081
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,880
and do you do the right thing

1082
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,599
immediately right after so you didn't

1083
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,760
pay for those mistakes by you know by

1084
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:23,760
failure so

1085
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,440
yeah how quickly did you fix it

1086
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,040
i guess there's a lot of ways to sneak

1087
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,559
up to this question of how the hell do

1088
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:30,400
you scale the thing

1089
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,400
other startups if you have an idea how

1090
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,000
do you scale the thing is this is just

1091
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,519
aws

1092
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,639
and uh

1093
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,800
you try to write the kind of code that's

1094
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,719
easy to spread across a large number of

1095
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,000
instances and then

1096
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:48,799
the rest is just put money into it

1097
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,920
basically i would say a couple things

1098
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,079
first off

1099
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,599
don't even ask the question just find

1100
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,920
product market fit

1101
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,240
duct tape it together right like if you

1102
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,240
have to i think there's a big caveat

1103
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,159
here which i want to get to

1104
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,159
but generally all that matters is

1105
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:06,879
product market fit that's all that

1106
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:09,440
matters if people like your product

1107
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:11,119
do not worry about when 50 000 people

1108
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,800
use your product because you will be

1109
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,000
happy that you have that problem when

1110
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,200
you get there i actually can't name

1111
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,559
many

1112
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,159
startups

1113
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:22,320
where they go from

1114
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,319
nothing to something overnight and they

1115
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,680
can't figure out how to scale it there

1116
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,640
are some

1117
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:30,559
but i think nowadays it's a when i say a

1118
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,118
solved problem like

1119
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,880
there are ways of solving it

1120
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,720
the base case is typically that startups

1121
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,559
worry way too much about

1122
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:39,679
scaling way too early and forget that

1123
00:37:38,559 --> 00:37:41,519
they actually have to make something

1124
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,519
that people like that's the that's the

1125
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,759
default mistake case

1126
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,838
but what i'll say is um

1127
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,320
once you start scaling

1128
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,920
i mean hiring quickly people who have

1129
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,960
seen the game before and just know how

1130
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:57,039
to do it it it becomes um

1131
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,119
it becomes a bit of like yeah just throw

1132
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,800
instances of the problem right

1133
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,280
but the last thing i'll say on this that

1134
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:05,280
i think did save us um

1135
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,400
we were pretty rigorous about writing

1136
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,160
tests uh from the beginning

1137
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,000
that helped us

1138
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:14,480
move very very quickly when we wanted to

1139
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,838
rewrite parts of the product

1140
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,119
and know that we weren't breaking

1141
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:18,400
something else

1142
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,559
tests are one of those things where it's

1143
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,559
like you go slow to go fast

1144
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,000
and they suck when you have to write

1145
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:25,358
them because you have to figure it out

1146
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,880
and

1147
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:28,159
they're always those ones that break

1148
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,599
when you don't want them to break and

1149
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:31,118
they're annoying and it feels like you

1150
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,680
spent all this time but

1151
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,720
looking back i think that like long-term

1152
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:38,719
optimal even with the team of four

1153
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,319
it allowed us to move very very quickly

1154
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:42,559
because anyone could touch any part of

1155
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,400
the the the product and know that they

1156
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,639
weren't going to bring down the site or

1157
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,960
at least in general at which point do

1158
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:51,039
you know product market fit how many

1159
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:53,119
users would you say what is it all it

1160
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,679
takes is like 10 people or is it a

1161
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,599
thousand is it 50 000

1162
00:38:55,679 --> 00:38:59,759
i don't think it is

1163
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,920
generally a question of absolute numbers

1164
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,839
i think it's a question of cohorts and i

1165
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,680
think it's a question of trends so

1166
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,679
you know it depends how big

1167
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,358
your business is trying to be right but

1168
00:39:09,679 --> 00:39:14,319
if i were signing up a thousand people a

1169
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:16,000
week and they all retain like the

1170
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,240
retention curves for those cohorts

1171
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,599
looked good healthy

1172
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,279
and even like

1173
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,359
as you started getting more people on

1174
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,880
the service maybe those earlier cohorts

1175
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,159
started curving up again because now

1176
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,240
there are network effects and their

1177
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:29,679
friends are on the service or totally

1178
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:32,239
depends what type of business you're in

1179
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:33,919
but i'm talking purely social right

1180
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,078
um

1181
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,400
i don't think it's an absolute

1182
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,160
number i think it is a i guess you could

1183
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,320
call it a marginal number so i spend a

1184
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,879
lot of time when i work with startups

1185
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:47,440
asking them like okay have you looked at

1186
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,358
that cohort versus this cohort whether

1187
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,079
it's your clients or whether it's people

1188
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:54,159
signing up for uh the service

1189
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,079
but a lot of people think you just have

1190
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:57,679
to hit some mark like 10 000 people or

1191
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,839
50 000 people

1192
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:01,919
but really

1193
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,318
seven-ish billion people in the world

1194
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,000
most people forever will not know about

1195
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,239
your product there are always more

1196
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,400
people out there to sign up it's just a

1197
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,279
question of how you turn on the spigot

1198
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,240
so

1199
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:16,560
at that stage early stage

1200
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,559
yourself but also by way of advice

1201
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:20,799
should you worry about money at all how

1202
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:24,239
this thing is going to make money or do

1203
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:26,960
you just try to find product market fit

1204
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,479
and get a lot of users to enjoy using

1205
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,318
your thing

1206
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,960
i think it totally depends and that's an

1207
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:34,800
unsatisfying answer um i was talking

1208
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,318
with a friend today

1209
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,318
who

1210
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:39,920
he was one of our earlier investors and

1211
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:41,838
he was saying hey like have you been

1212
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,680
doing any angel investing lately i said

1213
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,559
not really i'm just like focused on what

1214
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,318
i want to do next and

1215
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,679
he said the number of financings have

1216
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:53,039
just gone bonkers like just bonk

1217
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:56,318
like people are throwing money

1218
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:57,920
everywhere right now um

1219
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,480
and

1220
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,159
i think the question is

1221
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,000
do you have an inkling of how you're

1222
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:06,480
gonna make money

1223
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,559
or are you really just like waving your

1224
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,440
hands i would not like to be an

1225
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,440
entrepreneur in the position of

1226
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,880
well i have no idea how this will

1227
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,440
eventually make money that's not fun um

1228
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:22,720
if you are in an area like let's say you

1229
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,400
wanted to start a social network right

1230
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:25,759
not saying this is a good idea but if

1231
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,200
you did

1232
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,720
they're only a handful of ways they've

1233
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:29,838
made money and really only one way

1234
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:31,759
they've made money in the past and

1235
00:41:29,838 --> 00:41:32,480
that's ads

1236
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
so

1237
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,880
you know

1238
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,200
if you

1239
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,920
have a service that's amenable to that

1240
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,439
and

1241
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,960
then i wouldn't worry too much about

1242
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:42,318
that because if you get to the scale you

1243
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,159
can hire some smart people and figure

1244
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:45,679
that out

1245
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:47,838
i

1246
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,358
do think that is really healthy for a

1247
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:51,039
lot of startups these days especially

1248
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,799
the ones doing like

1249
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,358
enterprise software

1250
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,960
slacks of the world etc to be worried

1251
00:41:55,358 --> 00:42:00,078
about money from the beginning but

1252
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:04,240
mostly as a way of winning over clients

1253
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:04,240
and having stickiness um

1254
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,358
i think i like of course you need to be

1255
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:09,519
worried about money but i'm going to

1256
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:12,000
also say this again which is

1257
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:14,239
it's like long-term profitability

1258
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,679
if you have a roadmap to that then

1259
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:17,358
that's great

1260
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,039
but if you're just like i don't know

1261
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:22,239
maybe never like we're working on this

1262
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,920
meta first thing i think maybe someday

1263
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,159
i don't know like that seems harder to

1264
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,280
me um so you have to be as big as

1265
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:31,118
facebook to like finance that bet right

1266
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,800
do you think it's possible you said

1267
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:35,119
you're not saying it's necessarily a

1268
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,680
good idea to launch a social network

1269
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,880
do you think it's possible

1270
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:40,159
today

1271
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,200
maybe you can put yourself in those

1272
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,639
shoes

1273
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:46,639
to launch a social network that achieves

1274
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:49,838
the scale of a facebook

1275
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:53,279
or a twitter or an instagram and maybe

1276
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:55,358
even greater scale absolutely

1277
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,599
how do you do it

1278
00:42:55,358 --> 00:42:59,199
asking for a friend yeah if i knew i i'd

1279
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,359
probably be doing it right now and not

1280
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,199
sitting here so

1281
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,838
i mean there's a lot of ways to ask this

1282
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:08,719
question one is create a totally new

1283
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:10,159
product market fit create a new market

1284
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:11,679
create something like instagram did

1285
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:13,039
which is like create something kind of

1286
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,000
new

1287
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:16,239
or

1288
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,318
literally out compete facebook at its

1289
00:43:16,239 --> 00:43:19,679
own thing or i'll compete twitter at its

1290
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,679
own thing

1291
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,000
the only way to compete now if you want

1292
00:43:21,679 --> 00:43:25,919
to build a large social network is to

1293
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,119
look for the cracks look for the

1294
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,000
openings

1295
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:28,960
um

1296
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,960
you know

1297
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,400
no one competed

1298
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,240
i mean no one competed with the core

1299
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:36,720
business of google no one competed with

1300
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,479
the core business of microsoft

1301
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:40,559
you don't go at

1302
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,760
the big guys doing exactly what they're

1303
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,759
doing

1304
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,599
instagram didn't win quote unquote

1305
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:47,599
because it tried to be

1306
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,838
a visual twitter like

1307
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:52,720
we spotted things that either twitter

1308
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:54,880
wasn't going to do or refused to do

1309
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,759
images and feed for the longest time

1310
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,519
right

1311
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,880
or that facebook wasn't doing or not

1312
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,960
paying attention to because they were

1313
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,400
mostly desktop at the time and we were

1314
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,960
purely mobile

1315
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,720
purely visual

1316
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:10,000
often there are opportunities sitting

1317
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:12,318
there you just have to you have to

1318
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,920
you have to figure out like uh i think

1319
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,318
like there's a strategy book i can't

1320
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,599
remember the name but talk about moats

1321
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:21,440
and just like the best place to play

1322
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,359
is where your competitor like literally

1323
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:25,920
can't pivot because structurally they're

1324
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:28,078
set up not to be there

1325
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,480
and that's where you win um

1326
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:33,200
and what's fascinating is like do you

1327
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,119
know how many people are like images

1328
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:37,118
facebook does that twitter does that i

1329
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,559
mean how wrong were they really wrong

1330
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,240
these are some of the smartest people in

1331
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:42,799
silicon valley right

1332
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:45,199
but now instagram exists for a while

1333
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,119
how is it that snapchat could then exist

1334
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:48,799
makes no sense

1335
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,720
like plenty of people would say well

1336
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,800
there's facebook no images okay okay i

1337
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,799
mean instagram i'll give you that one

1338
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,960
but wait now another image based social

1339
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,839
network's gonna get really big

1340
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,720
and then tick tock comes along

1341
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:03,279
like

1342
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:05,199
the prior so you asked me is it possible

1343
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,800
the only answer and reason i'm answering

1344
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:08,879
yes is because

1345
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,720
my prior is that it's happened once

1346
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,920
every i don't know three four or five

1347
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,078
years

1348
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,000
consistently and i can't imagine there's

1349
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:17,440
anything structurally that would change

1350
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,039
that

1351
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,119
so that's why i answer that way not

1352
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,800
because i know how i just

1353
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,559
when you see a pattern you see a pattern

1354
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,400
and there's no reason to believe that's

1355
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:28,880
going to stop and it's subtle too

1356
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,760
because like you said snapchat and tick

1357
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,599
tock they're all doing the same space of

1358
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:36,079
things but there's something

1359
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:37,920
fundamentally different about

1360
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:40,079
like a three second video and a five

1361
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:42,079
second video and a 15 second video in a

1362
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:43,760
one minute video and a one hour video

1363
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,560
right like fundamentally different

1364
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,319
fundamentally different i mean i think

1365
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,239
one of the reasons snapchat exists is

1366
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:54,079
because instagram was so focused on

1367
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:57,039
posting great beautiful manicured

1368
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:58,480
versions of yourself throughout time

1369
00:45:57,039 --> 00:46:00,800
and there was this enormous demand of

1370
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,960
like hey i really like this behavior i

1371
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,119
love using instagram but

1372
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:07,760
man i just like wish i could share

1373
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,838
something going on in my day like

1374
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,760
do i really have to put it on my profile

1375
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:12,960
do i really have to make it last forever

1376
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,200
do i really

1377
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,199
um and that opened up a door it created

1378
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:18,719
a market right and then what's

1379
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:20,559
fascinating is

1380
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,879
instagram had an explore page for the

1381
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:23,679
longest time it was image driven right

1382
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,760
um

1383
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,199
but there's absolutely a behavior where

1384
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,200
you open up instagram and you sit on the

1385
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,439
explore page all day that is effectively

1386
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:34,159
tick tock but obviously focused on

1387
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,559
videos and it's not like you could just

1388
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:38,239
put the explore page in tik tok form and

1389
00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:39,679
it works it had to be video it had to

1390
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,759
have music

1391
00:46:39,679 --> 00:46:43,118
these are the hard parts about product

1392
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,160
development that are very hard to

1393
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:46,000
predict

1394
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:47,838
but um

1395
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,000
they're all versions of the same thing

1396
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,358
with varying

1397
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,039
if you line them up in a bunch of

1398
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:55,039
dimensions they're just like

1399
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,318
kind of on

1400
00:46:55,039 --> 00:46:58,559
they're different values of the same

1401
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:00,880
dimensions which is like i guess easy to

1402
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,639
say in retrospect but like if i were an

1403
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:05,039
entrepreneur going after that area i'd

1404
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,879
ask myself like where's the opening

1405
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:08,400
what needs to exist because tiktok

1406
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:11,280
exists now

1407
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,519
so i wonder how much

1408
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,839
things that don't yet exist and can

1409
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:18,000
exist is in the space of algorithms in

1410
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:18,880
the space of recommender systems

1411
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,480
so

1412
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,880
in the space of how the feed is

1413
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,599
generated so we kind of talk about the

1414
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,280
actual elements of the um

1415
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,760
the content that's what we've been

1416
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,480
talking the difference between photos

1417
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:35,040
between uh short videos longer videos i

1418
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,039
wonder how much disruption is possible

1419
00:47:35,039 --> 00:47:38,719
in the way the algorithms work

1420
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,159
because a lot of the criticism towards

1421
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:42,399
social media is in the way the

1422
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,598
algorithms work currently and it feels

1423
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,160
like

1424
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,160
first of all talking about

1425
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:49,519
product market fit there's certainly a

1426
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:50,838
hunger

1427
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,358
for

1428
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:56,799
um social media

1429
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:58,480
algorithms that do something different i

1430
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,200
don't think anyone everyone said

1431
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:02,960
complaining this is not doing this is

1432
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:05,679
this is hurting me and this is hurting

1433
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:07,280
society but i keep doing it because i'm

1434
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,919
addicted to it

1435
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,800
and they say we want something different

1436
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,760
but we don't know what it feels like a

1437
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,920
uh

1438
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,760
just different uh it feels like there's

1439
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,280
a hunger for that

1440
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,960
but that's in the space of algorithms i

1441
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,200
wonder if it's possible to disrupt in

1442
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,559
that space absolutely

1443
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:27,039
um

1444
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,960
i have this thesis that

1445
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:31,920
the worst part about social networks is

1446
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:33,599
that they're uh

1447
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,720
is the people

1448
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,559
it's it's

1449
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:37,838
it's a line that sounds funny right

1450
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,240
because like that's why you call it a

1451
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:42,639
social network um but what does social

1452
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:44,479
networks actually do for you like just

1453
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,318
think you know like

1454
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,400
imagine you were an alien and you landed

1455
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:49,679
and someone says hey there's this site

1456
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,039
it's a social network we're not going to

1457
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:52,960
tell you what it is but just what does

1458
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:56,639
it do and you have to explain it to them

1459
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,639
it does two things one is that

1460
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:59,440
people you know and have social ties

1461
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:02,799
with

1462
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,760
uh distribute updates through whether

1463
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,119
it's uh you know photos or videos

1464
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,480
about their lives so that you don't have

1465
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,400
to physically be with them but you can

1466
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,159
keep in touch with them that's one

1467
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,920
that's like a big part of instagram

1468
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,399
that's a big part of snap

1469
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,960
it is not part of tick tock at all so

1470
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,400
there's another big part which is

1471
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,318
there's all this content out in the

1472
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,160
world that's entertaining

1473
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:25,599
whether you want to watch it or you want

1474
00:49:24,159 --> 00:49:26,719
to read it

1475
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:28,800
um

1476
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:31,519
and matchmaking between content that

1477
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,599
exists in the world and

1478
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,599
uh people that want that content turns

1479
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:37,200
out to be like a really big business

1480
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:39,119
right search and discovery would you

1481
00:49:37,199 --> 00:49:40,799
search and discovery but my point is it

1482
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,318
could be video it could be text it could

1483
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,720
be websites it could be i mean think

1484
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:47,039
back to um

1485
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,399
think back to like dig right or stumble

1486
00:49:47,039 --> 00:49:49,199
upon or

1487
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,240
right

1488
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:51,838
nice

1489
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:53,759
yeah but like what did those do like

1490
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,838
they basically distributed interesting

1491
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,440
content to you right

1492
00:49:55,838 --> 00:50:00,078
um

1493
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,240
i think the most interesting part or the

1494
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,480
future of social networks is going to be

1495
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,479
making them less social because i think

1496
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,240
people are part of the root cause of the

1497
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,480
problem so for instance

1498
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:12,159
um often in recommender systems we talk

1499
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,599
about two stages there's a candidate

1500
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,838
generation step

1501
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:18,318
which is just like of our vast trove of

1502
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:20,719
stuff that you might want to see

1503
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:22,400
what small subset

1504
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:23,919
should we pick for you

1505
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,760
okay

1506
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,440
typically that is grabbed from things

1507
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,240
your friends have shared

1508
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,318
right

1509
00:50:28,239 --> 00:50:32,558
then there's a ranking step which says

1510
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:34,800
okay now given these hundred 200 things

1511
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:37,040
depends on the network right let's like

1512
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,960
be really good about ranking them and

1513
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,039
generally rank the things up higher that

1514
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,480
get the most engagement right so what's

1515
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,599
the problem with that

1516
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:47,440
step one is we've limited everything you

1517
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,359
could possibly see to things that your

1518
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,159
friends have chosen to share

1519
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:54,239
or maybe not friends but influencers

1520
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:55,440
what things do people generally want to

1521
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:56,799
share they want to share things that are

1522
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,480
going to get likes that are going to

1523
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,240
show up broadly

1524
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,800
so they tend to be more emotionally

1525
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:05,039
driven they tend to be more risque or

1526
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,640
whatever so why do we have this problem

1527
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,400
it's because

1528
00:51:06,639 --> 00:51:10,000
we show people things people have

1529
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:12,079
decided to share and those things

1530
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:14,000
self-select to being the things that are

1531
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:16,400
most divisive

1532
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,440
so how do you fix that

1533
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,960
well

1534
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,720
what if you just

1535
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,400
imagine for a second that why do you

1536
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:23,759
have to grab things from things your

1537
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,358
friends have shared why not just like

1538
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,359
grab things

1539
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:28,480
that's really fascinating to me and

1540
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:30,880
that's something i've been thinking a

1541
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,280
lot about and just like

1542
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,800
you know why is it that when you log on

1543
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:37,359
to twitter

1544
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,280
you're just sitting there looking at

1545
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:42,159
things from accounts that you've

1546
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,440
followed for whatever reason

1547
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:45,118
and tick tock i think has done a

1548
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,039
wonderful job here which is like you can

1549
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,838
literally be anyone

1550
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,599
and if you produce something

1551
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:52,880
fascinating it'll go viral

1552
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:54,318
but like

1553
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,000
you don't have to be someone that anyone

1554
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:58,239
knows you don't have to have built up a

1555
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,920
giant following you don't have to have

1556
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:01,358
paid for followers

1557
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,800
you don't have to try to maintain those

1558
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,558
followers you literally just have to

1559
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,480
produce something interesting

1560
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,240
that is i think the future of social

1561
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,318
networking that's the that's the

1562
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:13,838
direction things will head and i think

1563
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:16,159
what you'll find is it's far less about

1564
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:18,239
people manipulating distribution and far

1565
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,519
more about what is like is this content

1566
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,318
good

1567
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:25,280
and good is obviously a vague definition

1568
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:27,039
that we spend hours on but

1569
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,960
different networks i think will decide

1570
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:30,400
different value functions to decide what

1571
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,159
is good and what isn't good and i i

1572
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,519
think that's a fascinating direction so

1573
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:35,039
that's almost like creating an internet

1574
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:36,079
i mean that's what google did for web

1575
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:37,358
pages

1576
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:39,280
they did the

1577
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:41,598
you know page rank search

1578
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,599
so discovery you don't you don't follow

1579
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:46,318
anybody on google when you use a search

1580
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:48,720
engine you just discover web pages and

1581
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:51,599
so what tick tock does

1582
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:54,558
is saying let's start from scratch

1583
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:56,240
let's like like start a new internet and

1584
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,160
have people discover stuff on that new

1585
00:52:56,239 --> 00:53:00,159
internet within a particular kind of

1586
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,399
pool of people well what's so

1587
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:04,960
fascinating about this is like the

1588
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,280
the um field of information retrieval

1589
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,720
like i always talked about and as i was

1590
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,720
studying this stuff they would always

1591
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:12,239
use the word query and document so i was

1592
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:14,000
like why are they saying query

1593
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,358
undocuments like they're literally

1594
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,039
imagine like

1595
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,960
if you just stop thinking about query as

1596
00:53:17,039 --> 00:53:20,960
like literally a search query and a

1597
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:21,838
query could be a person i mean a lot of

1598
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,039
the way

1599
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:24,639
i'm not going to claim to know how

1600
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,079
instagram or facebook machine learning

1601
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:27,199
works today

1602
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:29,599
but

1603
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:31,358
you know if you want to find a match for

1604
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,119
a query the query is actually the

1605
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:35,279
attributes of the person

1606
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,640
their age their gender where they're

1607
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,720
from

1608
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,440
maybe some kind of summarization of

1609
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:43,279
their interests and and that's a query

1610
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,480
right and that matches against documents

1611
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,240
and by the way documents don't have to

1612
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,400
be text they can be

1613
00:53:46,239 --> 00:53:49,759
videos they're however long i don't know

1614
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,838
what the limit is on tick tock these

1615
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,559
days they keep changing it my point is

1616
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:54,400
just

1617
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,240
you've got a query which is someone in

1618
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,240
search of something that they want to

1619
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:59,679
match and you've got the document it

1620
00:53:58,239 --> 00:54:02,000
doesn't have to be text it could be

1621
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,598
anything and how do you match make and

1622
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,079
that's one of these like i mean i've

1623
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,838
spent a lot of time thinking about this

1624
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,640
and i don't claim to have mastered it at

1625
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:10,318
all

1626
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:12,400
but i think it's so fascinating about

1627
00:54:10,318 --> 00:54:14,880
where that will go with new social

1628
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,639
networks see what i'm also fascinated by

1629
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,000
is metrics that are different than

1630
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:19,519
engagement

1631
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,800
so the other thing from an alien

1632
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:22,960
perspective

1633
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,359
what social networks are doing

1634
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,240
is they

1635
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:30,558
they in the short term bring out

1636
00:54:28,239 --> 00:54:32,399
different aspects of each human being so

1637
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,640
first let me say

1638
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,639
that

1639
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:40,558
an algorithm or a social network

1640
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,318
for each individual can bring out

1641
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,240
the best of that person or the worst of

1642
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:46,318
that person or there's a bunch of

1643
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,199
different parts to us parts we're proud

1644
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:48,000
of

1645
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:50,719
that

1646
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,480
that we are parts we're not so proud of

1647
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:55,039
when we look at the big picture of our

1648
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,719
lives when we look back 30 days from now

1649
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,119
am i proud that i said those things or

1650
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:02,000
not am i proud that i felt those things

1651
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:04,240
am i proud that i experienced or read

1652
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,000
those things or thought about those

1653
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:08,000
things just in that kind of

1654
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,639
self-reflective kind of way

1655
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,079
and so coupled with that i wonder if

1656
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:14,078
it's possible to have different metrics

1657
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,400
they're not just about engagement

1658
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:18,960
but are about

1659
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,798
long-term happiness

1660
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,079
growth of a human being well they look

1661
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,159
back and say

1662
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,798
i am a better human being for having

1663
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:27,598
spent 100 hours on that app

1664
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:29,920
and

1665
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,920
that feels like it's actually strongly

1666
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,000
correlated with engagement

1667
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:36,240
in the long term in the short term it

1668
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,719
might not be but in long term it's like

1669
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:40,639
the same kind of thing where you really

1670
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,159
fall in love with the product

1671
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:43,679
you fall in love with an iphone you fall

1672
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:45,199
in love with a car

1673
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:46,239
that's what makes you fall in love is

1674
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:47,279
like

1675
00:55:46,239 --> 00:55:49,358
really

1676
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,319
being proud

1677
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,078
and just

1678
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:53,759
in a self-reflective way understanding

1679
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,519
that you're a better human being for

1680
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,640
having used the thing and that's like

1681
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,159
where the f

1682
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:01,519
that's what great relationships are made

1683
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:03,838
from it's not just like you're hot

1684
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:05,358
and we like being together or something

1685
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:07,440
like that it's more like i'm a better

1686
00:56:05,358 --> 00:56:09,440
human being because i'm with you

1687
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:12,480
and that feels like a metric that could

1688
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:15,280
be optimized for by the algorithms

1689
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:17,679
um but you know anytime i kind of talk

1690
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,599
about this with anybody they seem to say

1691
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:22,399
yeah okay that's going to get out

1692
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,559
competed immediately by the engagement

1693
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,400
if it's ad driven especially

1694
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,720
i just don't think so

1695
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,480
i don't i mean

1696
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,919
a lot of is just implementation

1697
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:36,798
i'll say a couple things one is to

1698
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:38,318
pull back the curtain on daily meetings

1699
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:40,318
inside of these large social media

1700
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:42,000
companies

1701
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,079
a lot of what

1702
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,760
management or at least the people that

1703
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,760
are are tweaking these algorithms spend

1704
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,520
their time on our trade-offs

1705
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,839
and there's these things called value

1706
00:56:49,519 --> 00:56:54,239
functions which are like okay

1707
00:56:51,838 --> 00:56:55,679
we can predict the probability that

1708
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:58,479
you'll click on this thing or the

1709
00:56:55,679 --> 00:57:00,239
probability that you'll share it or the

1710
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,400
probability that you will leave a

1711
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,558
comment on it or the probability

1712
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,119
you'll dwell on it

1713
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,519
individual actions right

1714
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:11,039
and you've got this neural network that

1715
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:13,280
basically has a bunch of heads at the

1716
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,480
end and all of them are between zero and

1717
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,559
one and

1718
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,480
great they all have values right or

1719
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,599
or they all have probabilities

1720
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,960
um

1721
00:57:19,599 --> 00:57:23,200
and then in these meetings what they

1722
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:26,318
will do is say well uh

1723
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,039
how much do we value a comment versus a

1724
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:30,639
click versus a share versus a

1725
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,719
and then maybe even some downstream

1726
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:35,199
thing right that has nothing to do with

1727
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:37,439
the item there but like

1728
00:57:35,199 --> 00:57:39,838
driving follows or something

1729
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,440
and what typically happens is they will

1730
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:43,119
say well what are our goals for this

1731
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,760
quarter at the company oh we want to

1732
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:47,358
drive sharing up okay well let's uh turn

1733
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,559
down these metrics and turn up these

1734
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:50,960
metrics

1735
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:52,880
and and they blend them right into a

1736
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:55,199
single scaler with which they're trying

1737
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,000
to optimize

1738
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:59,519
that is really hard because invariably

1739
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,798
you think you're solving for i don't

1740
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:02,559
know something called meaningful

1741
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:04,480
interactions right

1742
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:06,240
this was the big facebook pivot and i i

1743
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,920
don't actually have any internal

1744
00:58:06,239 --> 00:58:08,879
knowledge like i wasn't in those

1745
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,280
meetings

1746
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:14,400
but at least from from what we've seen

1747
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,319
over the last month or so it seems by

1748
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,400
actually trying to trying to optimize

1749
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,079
for meaningful interactions it had all

1750
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,920
these side effects of optimizing for

1751
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,240
these other things

1752
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:26,318
and i don't claim to fully understand

1753
00:58:24,239 --> 00:58:28,719
them but what i will say

1754
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:30,558
is that trade-offs abound

1755
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,798
and as much as you'd like to solve for

1756
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,559
one thing if you have a network of over

1757
00:58:32,798 --> 00:58:35,519
a billion people

1758
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:37,119
you're gonna have unintended

1759
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:38,719
consequences either way and it gets

1760
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,640
really hard

1761
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,798
so what you're describing is effectively

1762
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:44,719
a value model that says like can we

1763
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:46,079
capture this is the thing that i spent a

1764
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,519
lot of time thinking about like can you

1765
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,760
capture

1766
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:51,838
utility

1767
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,440
in a way that like actually measures

1768
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:55,759
someone's happiness

1769
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,440
that isn't just a um

1770
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,520
what do they call it a surrogate problem

1771
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,679
where you say well i kind of think like

1772
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:03,440
the more you use the product

1773
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:04,879
the happier you are that was always the

1774
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,480
argument at facebook by the way it was

1775
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,079
like well

1776
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:10,079
people use it more so they must be more

1777
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,519
happy yeah turns out they're like a lot

1778
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,280
of things you use more that make you

1779
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,119
less happy in the world not talking

1780
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:16,000
about facebook just you know let's think

1781
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,760
about

1782
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,358
whether it's gambling or whatever like

1783
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,280
that you can do more of but doesn't

1784
00:59:19,358 --> 00:59:23,838
necessarily make you happier so the idea

1785
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,160
that time equals happiness obviously

1786
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:28,719
you can't map utility and time together

1787
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:30,078
easily there are a lot of edge cases

1788
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:31,598
so when you look around the world and

1789
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,280
you say well what are all the ways we

1790
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,240
can model utility that is like one of

1791
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,920
the

1792
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:37,919
please if you know someone smart doing

1793
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:40,480
this introduce me because i'm fascinated

1794
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,639
by it and it seems really tough

1795
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:45,440
but the idea that reinforcement learning

1796
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:47,279
like everyone interesting i know in

1797
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,720
machine learning like i was really

1798
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,200
interested in recommender systems and

1799
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:52,959
supervised learning and

1800
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:54,798
and the more i dug into it i was like oh

1801
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,318
literally everyone smart is working on

1802
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,079
reinforcement learning

1803
00:59:56,318 --> 00:59:59,838
like literally everyone you just made

1804
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,680
people at open ai and deep mind very

1805
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:03,358
happy yes but i mean but what's

1806
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:06,480
interesting is like it's one thing to

1807
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:08,318
train a game and like

1808
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,639
i mean that paper that where they just

1809
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:13,759
took atari and they used a convnet to

1810
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:15,598
basically just like train simple actions

1811
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,720
mind-blowing right absolutely

1812
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:21,760
mind-blowing but it's a game great

1813
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:24,399
so now what if you're constructing

1814
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,359
a feed for a person right

1815
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,880
like

1816
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,440
how can you

1817
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:31,519
construct that feed in such a way

1818
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,200
that optimizes for a diversity of

1819
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:36,719
experience a

1820
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:39,118
a long term happiness right

1821
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:41,039
but that reward function it turns out in

1822
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,400
reinforcement learning again

1823
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:45,199
as i've learned

1824
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,880
like reward design is really hard

1825
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:48,639
and

1826
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,720
i don't know like how do you design a

1827
01:00:48,639 --> 01:00:52,159
scalar reward for someone's happiness

1828
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:54,159
over time i mean do you have to measure

1829
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:56,480
dopamine levels like do you have to well

1830
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:59,440
you have to have a lot of

1831
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,798
a lot more signals from the human being

1832
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:02,880
currently it feels like there's not

1833
01:01:00,798 --> 01:01:04,798
enough signals coming from the human

1834
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,960
being users of uh

1835
01:01:04,798 --> 01:01:08,559
of this algorithm so for reinforcement

1836
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,720
learning to work well

1837
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,079
it needs to have a lot more data

1838
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:13,439
needs to have a lot of data and that

1839
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,359
actually is a challenge for anyone who

1840
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,880
wants to start something which is you

1841
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:19,039
don't have a lot of data so how do you

1842
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:21,519
compete but i do think back to your

1843
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:24,480
original point rethinking the algorithm

1844
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:26,719
rethinking reward functions rethinking

1845
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,719
utility

1846
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:31,838
that's fascinating that's cool and i

1847
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:34,399
think that's an open opportunity for

1848
01:01:31,838 --> 01:01:37,279
for a company that figures it out

1849
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:39,599
i have to ask about april 2012

1850
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,079
when instagram

1851
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:45,200
along with its massive

1852
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:47,839
employee base of 13 people was sold to

1853
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:49,759
facebook for 1 billion dollars

1854
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:52,159
what was the process like on a business

1855
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:54,240
level engineering level human level what

1856
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:56,399
was that process of selling to facebook

1857
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:58,239
like what did it feel like

1858
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,920
so i want to provide some context which

1859
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:00,959
is i worked in corporate development at

1860
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,639
google

1861
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,159
which not a lot of people know but

1862
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:06,480
corporate development is effectively the

1863
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:08,558
group that buys companies right you sit

1864
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,480
there and you acquire companies and i

1865
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:12,480
had sat through so many of these

1866
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,079
meetings with entrepreneurs we actually

1867
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,280
fun fact we never acquired a single

1868
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,200
company when i worked in corporate

1869
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:20,960
development so i can't claim that

1870
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:22,879
um i had like a lot of experience

1871
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:24,720
but i had enough experience to

1872
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:27,200
understand okay like what prices are

1873
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:28,639
people getting and what's the process

1874
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:30,879
and

1875
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:32,159
and as we started to grow

1876
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:33,440
you know

1877
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:35,118
we were trying to keep this thing

1878
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:37,599
running and we were exhausted and we

1879
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:41,200
were 13 people and i mean we were trying

1880
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:43,680
to think back he was probably 27

1881
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:44,480
37 now um

1882
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:45,440
so

1883
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:48,960
young

1884
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,400
and on a relative basis right and uh

1885
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,318
we're trying to keep the thing running

1886
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,559
and then you know we go out to raise

1887
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:56,159
money and

1888
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:57,280
we're kind of like the hot startup at

1889
01:02:56,159 --> 01:02:59,598
the time

1890
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,599
and i remember going into a specific vc

1891
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:03,760
and saying our terms we're looking for

1892
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,359
are we're looking for a 500 million

1893
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,079
valuation

1894
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:10,078
and i've never seen so many jaws drop

1895
01:03:08,079 --> 01:03:11,760
all in unison right

1896
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,079
and i was like thanked and walked out

1897
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:16,480
the door very kindly after

1898
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:18,480
um and then i got a call the next day uh

1899
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:19,920
from someone who was connected to them

1900
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,519
and said they said

1901
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,039
we just want to let you know that like

1902
01:03:21,519 --> 01:03:24,400
uh it was pretty offensive that you

1903
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,240
asked for a 500 billion dollar

1904
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,318
evaluation and i i can't tell if that

1905
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:30,558
was um

1906
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:32,798
like just negotiating or what but it's

1907
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:35,039
true like no one offered us more right

1908
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:37,280
so we were so can you clarify the the

1909
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:40,240
number again you said how many million

1910
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,640
500 500 million 500 million yeah half a

1911
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:44,318
billion yeah um

1912
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:46,480
so in my mind i'm anchored like okay

1913
01:03:44,318 --> 01:03:49,038
well literally no one's biting at 500

1914
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,358
million and eventually we would get

1915
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:54,319
sequoia and greylock and others together

1916
01:03:51,358 --> 01:03:56,880
at 500 million basically uh post uh it

1917
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:59,759
was 450 pre i think we raised 50 million

1918
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,599
dollars but just like no one was used to

1919
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,839
seeing 500 million dollar

1920
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,160
companies then like i don't know if it

1921
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:08,400
was because we were just coming out of

1922
01:04:06,159 --> 01:04:09,920
the hangover 2008 and things were still

1923
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,440
on recovery

1924
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:15,280
mode

1925
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:17,358
but then along comes facebook and

1926
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,920
after some negotiation

1927
01:04:17,358 --> 01:04:21,920
we've 2xed the number from a half a

1928
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,920
billion to a billion

1929
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:24,960
yeah it seems pretty good

1930
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,920
you know

1931
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,000
and uh i think mark and i really saw eye

1932
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,280
to eye that this thing could be big um

1933
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,519
we thought we could

1934
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:35,839
their resources would help us scale it

1935
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:37,759
and in a lot of ways it de-risks

1936
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,358
i mean it degrees a lot of the employees

1937
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,599
lives for the rest of their lives

1938
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:43,519
including me including mike right

1939
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,280
um i think i might have had like 10

1940
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:46,318
grand in my bank account at the time

1941
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,280
right like

1942
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:51,519
we're working hard we had nothing um

1943
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,920
so on a relative basis it seemed

1944
01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:55,679
very high and then i think the last

1945
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:57,280
company to exit for anywhere close to a

1946
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:58,639
billion was youtube that i could think

1947
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:01,519
of

1948
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:04,000
and uh and thus began the giant long

1949
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:06,719
bull run of 2012 to all the way all the

1950
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,400
way to where we are now where um i saw

1951
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:11,679
some stat yesterday about like how many

1952
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,760
unicorns exist and it's absurd

1953
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:15,598
but then again never underestimate

1954
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,760
technology and like the value

1955
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:21,119
it can provide and man costs have

1956
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:22,720
dropped and man scale has increased and

1957
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,119
you can make businesses make a lot of

1958
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:26,318
money now but on a on a fundamental

1959
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,640
level

1960
01:05:26,318 --> 01:05:31,358
i don't know like how do you describe

1961
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:33,358
the decision to sell a company with 13

1962
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:35,519
people for a billion dollars so first of

1963
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:38,000
all like how

1964
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:40,798
did it take a lot of guts to set a table

1965
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,159
and say 500 million or 1 billion with

1966
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:43,759
mark zuckerberg

1967
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:46,960
it seems like a very large number with

1968
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,039
13. like especially like it doesn't seem

1969
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,159
it is it is they're all larger

1970
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:54,240
especially like you said before

1971
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:55,440
the unicorn

1972
01:05:54,239 --> 01:05:56,959
parade

1973
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,920
i like that i'm going to use that

1974
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,159
unicorn

1975
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:02,639
yeah the uh the the you are at the head

1976
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:07,358
of the unicorn parade it's the uh yeah

1977
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:07,358
it's a massive unicorn parade um okay so

1978
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,400
no i mean we knew we were worth

1979
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,639
quote-unquote a lot but we didn't i mean

1980
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,000
there was no market for instagram i mean

1981
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:17,519
it's not you could mark you couldn't

1982
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,760
mark to market this thing in the public

1983
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:21,759
markets you didn't quite understand what

1984
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:22,880
it would be worth or it was worth at the

1985
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:24,640
time

1986
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:26,240
so in a market an illiquid market where

1987
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:28,558
you have one buyer and one seller and

1988
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:30,159
you're going back and forth and

1989
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,798
well i guess there were

1990
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:34,798
like vc firms who are willing to

1991
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:36,719
you know invest at a certain valuation

1992
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:38,400
so

1993
01:06:36,719 --> 01:06:40,798
i don't know you just go with your gut

1994
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,599
and uh and at the end of the day i would

1995
01:06:40,798 --> 01:06:45,358
say um

1996
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:49,838
the hardest part

1997
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:52,318
of it was not realizing uh

1998
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:54,798
like when we sold it was tough because

1999
01:06:52,318 --> 01:06:57,038
like literally everywhere i go

2000
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:59,599
restaurants whatever like

2001
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,440
for a good six months after there was a

2002
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:03,359
lot of attention on the deal a lot of

2003
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:06,159
attention on the product a lot of

2004
01:07:03,358 --> 01:07:07,598
attention it was kind of miserable right

2005
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:10,078
and you're like wait like i made a lot

2006
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:13,119
of money but like why is this not great

2007
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:15,119
and it's because it turns out you know

2008
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:16,480
and i don't i don't know like i don't

2009
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:18,079
really keep in touch with mark but i've

2010
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,920
got to assume his job right now is not

2011
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,760
exactly the most happy job in the world

2012
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,280
it's really tough when you're on top and

2013
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,400
it's really tough when you're in the

2014
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,720
limelight

2015
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,358
so the decision itself was like oh cool

2016
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:31,279
this is great how lucky are we right so

2017
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:33,440
okay there's a million questions yeah go

2018
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:35,760
first of all first of all

2019
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,760
why

2020
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,200
why is it hard to be on top why did you

2021
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:43,039
not feel good

2022
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:44,960
like can you dig into that it always um

2023
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:47,280
i've heard like olympic athletes say

2024
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:49,280
after what they win gold they they get

2025
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:51,519
depressed

2026
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:53,760
is it something like that where

2027
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:55,119
it feels like

2028
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,680
it was kind of like a thing you were

2029
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:59,358
working towards yeah some some loose

2030
01:07:57,679 --> 01:08:01,118
definition of success and this sure

2031
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:03,358
psych feels like

2032
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,920
uh at least according to other startups

2033
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:08,000
this is what success looks like and now

2034
01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,680
why don't i feel any

2035
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,760
better i'm still human i still have all

2036
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:13,279
the same problems is that the nature or

2037
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:15,119
is it just like negative attention or

2038
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,679
some kind what i think it's all of the

2039
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:19,838
above um but to be clear there was a lot

2040
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:22,480
of happiness in terms of like oh my god

2041
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:24,798
this is great like we

2042
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:27,119
like won the super bowl of startups

2043
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:29,359
right um anyone who

2044
01:08:27,119 --> 01:08:31,599
can get to a liquidity event of anything

2045
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:33,359
meaningful feels like wow this is what

2046
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,039
we started out to do of course we want

2047
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:36,159
to create great things that people love

2048
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:37,039
but

2049
01:08:36,158 --> 01:08:38,798
um

2050
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,759
like we won in a big way but yeah

2051
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:44,798
there's this big like oh if we won what

2052
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:46,158
is like what's next i don't so

2053
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:47,359
they call it the we have arrived

2054
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:49,039
syndrome

2055
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:51,520
um

2056
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:53,119
which i i need to go back and look where

2057
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:54,319
i can quote that from but i remember

2058
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:55,920
reading about it at the time i was like

2059
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:57,920
oh yeah that's that

2060
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:59,600
i remember we had a product manager

2061
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:02,079
leave very early on when we got to

2062
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,759
facebook and he said to me um i just

2063
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:06,000
don't believe i can learn anything at

2064
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:06,960
this company anymore it's like it's hit

2065
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,319
its

2066
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:12,239
apex we sold it great i just don't have

2067
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,960
anything else to learn

2068
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:17,519
so from 2012 all the way to the day i

2069
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:19,920
left in 2018 like the amount i learned

2070
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:22,319
and the humility with which i realized

2071
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,319
oh we thought we won

2072
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:26,000
billion dollars is cool but like there

2073
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:28,319
are a hundred billion dollar companies

2074
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,399
and by the way on top of that

2075
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,560
we had no revenue we had i mean we had a

2076
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,358
cool product but we didn't scale it yet

2077
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:35,120
and

2078
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:37,600
there's so much to learn and then

2079
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:40,238
competitors and how fun was it to fight

2080
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:42,798
snapchat oh my god like it was

2081
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:45,919
it's like yankees red sox it's great

2082
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:48,319
like that's what you live for um

2083
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,640
you know you win some you lose some but

2084
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,560
uh the amount you can learn through that

2085
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,000
process uh

2086
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:57,280
what i've realized

2087
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:58,800
in life is that there is no end there's

2088
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:00,880
always someone who has more there's

2089
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,239
always more challenge just at different

2090
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:07,359
scales and uh it sounds like a little

2091
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:07,359
buddhist but um

2092
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,199
everything is super challenging whether

2093
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,960
you're like a small business or an

2094
01:10:11,198 --> 01:10:15,119
enormous business

2095
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:18,000
i say like choose the game you like to

2096
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:19,760
play right you've got to imagine that if

2097
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:21,920
you're an amazing basketball player you

2098
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,679
enjoy to some extent practicing

2099
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,119
basketball it's got to be something you

2100
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:26,000
love it's going to suck it's going to be

2101
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:27,439
hard

2102
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,359
you're going to have injuries right but

2103
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:31,678
you got to love it and the same thing

2104
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:32,559
with instagram which is

2105
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,039
um

2106
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,679
we might have sold but it was like great

2107
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:40,079
there's one super bowl title can we win

2108
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:41,840
five what else can we do

2109
01:10:40,079 --> 01:10:43,600
now i imagine you didn't ask this but

2110
01:10:41,840 --> 01:10:45,360
okay so i left

2111
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,760
there's a little bit of like what do you

2112
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:49,599
do next right like what do you how do

2113
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,480
you top that thing it's the wrong

2114
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,920
question

2115
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:52,959
the question is like when you wake up

2116
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,560
every day

2117
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,319
what is the hardest most interesting

2118
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,239
thing you can go work on

2119
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:00,639
because like at the end of the day we

2120
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:03,198
all turn into dirt doesn't matter right

2121
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:05,920
but what does matter is like can we

2122
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:08,319
really enjoy this life not in a

2123
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:09,679
hedonistic way because that's those

2124
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:11,439
it's like the reinforcement learning

2125
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:13,760
learning like short term versus

2126
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:15,839
long-term objectives

2127
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,840
can you wake up every day and truly

2128
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,440
enjoy what you're doing

2129
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:22,159
um

2130
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:23,599
knowing that it's going to be painful

2131
01:11:22,158 --> 01:11:25,359
knowing that like no matter what you

2132
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,440
choose it's going to be painful um

2133
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:29,519
whether you sit on a beach or whether

2134
01:11:27,439 --> 01:11:31,678
you manage a thousand people or ten

2135
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:33,199
thousand it's gonna be painful so choose

2136
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,640
something that's fun

2137
01:11:33,198 --> 01:11:36,960
to have pain

2138
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:41,280
um but yes there was uh there was a lot

2139
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:43,760
of we have arrived and um

2140
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:45,359
it's a maturation process you just have

2141
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,600
to go through so no matter how much

2142
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:50,000
success is there is how much money you

2143
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:51,679
make you have to wake up the next day

2144
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,719
and choose the hard life whatever that

2145
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:55,520
means next that's fun the fun slash hard

2146
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,560
life

2147
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,840
hard life that's fun i guess

2148
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,840
what i'm trying to say is slightly

2149
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,960
different which is just that no one

2150
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,279
realizes

2151
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,198
everything's gonna be hard

2152
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,639
even chilling out

2153
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:10,719
is hard and then you just start worrying

2154
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,679
about stupid stuff like i don't know

2155
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:13,920
like

2156
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,760
did so and so forget to paint the house

2157
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:18,239
today or like did the gardener come or

2158
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:20,000
whatever like yeah or oh i'm so angry

2159
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:21,119
and my shipment of wine didn't show up

2160
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,800
and i'm sitting here on the beach

2161
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:24,880
without my wine i don't know i'm making

2162
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,279
up now but like it turns out that

2163
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,760
even chilling aka meditation is hard

2164
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:31,198
work yeah i and at least meditation is

2165
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,880
like productive chilling where you're

2166
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:34,479
like actually training yourself to calm

2167
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:36,800
down and be but

2168
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:39,439
backing up for a moment everything's

2169
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:41,279
hard you might as well be like

2170
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:44,879
playing in the game you love to play i

2171
01:12:41,279 --> 01:12:48,000
just like playing and winning and

2172
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:49,920
and i'm i'm on the on the i'm still on

2173
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:52,000
the i think the first half of life knock

2174
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,600
on wood um

2175
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,600
and i've got a lot of years what am i

2176
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:57,679
going to do sit around and the other way

2177
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:59,600
of looking at this by the way

2178
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:02,239
um

2179
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:05,120
imagine you made one movie it was great

2180
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:07,198
would you just like stop making movies

2181
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:08,640
no generally you're like wow i really

2182
01:13:07,198 --> 01:13:10,559
like making movies let's make another

2183
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,000
one a lot of times by the way the second

2184
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,760
one or the third one not that great but

2185
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,520
the fourth one awesome

2186
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,920
and no one forgets the sec everyone

2187
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,400
forgets the second and the third one so

2188
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,719
there's just this constant process of

2189
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:24,559
like can i produce

2190
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:25,840
and is that fun is that exciting what

2191
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,920
else can i learn so this machine

2192
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,600
learning stuff for me has been this

2193
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:31,600
awesome new chapter

2194
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,120
of being like

2195
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,280
man that's something i didn't understand

2196
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:37,039
at all and now i feel like i'm one-tenth

2197
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:38,639
of the way there

2198
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:40,158
and that feels like a big mountain to

2199
01:13:38,640 --> 01:13:42,079
climb uh

2200
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:43,519
so i distracted us from the original

2201
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:44,719
question no

2202
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,719
return to machine learning because i'd

2203
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:49,198
love to explore your interest there but

2204
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,960
i mean speaking of sort of challenges

2205
01:13:49,198 --> 01:13:52,639
and hard things is there a possible

2206
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:54,480
world

2207
01:13:52,640 --> 01:13:56,000
where sitting in a room with mark

2208
01:13:54,479 --> 01:13:58,319
zuckerberg

2209
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:01,119
with a one billion dollar deal

2210
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:02,639
you turn it down yeah of course

2211
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:04,800
what does that world

2212
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,719
look like why would you turn it down why

2213
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,119
did you take it what was the calculation

2214
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,239
that you were making ah thus enters the

2215
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:13,039
world of

2216
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:14,879
counterfactuals and not really knowing

2217
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:17,119
and if only we could run that experiment

2218
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:19,600
well the universe exists it's just

2219
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:22,960
running in parallel to our own yeah

2220
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,640
it's so fascinating right um

2221
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:26,840
i mean we're talking a lot about money

2222
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,719
but the real question was

2223
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:30,079
um

2224
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,439
i'm not sure you'll believe me when i

2225
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:33,840
say this but

2226
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:36,000
could we strap our little company onto

2227
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,239
the side of a rocket ship

2228
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,560
and like get out to a lot of people

2229
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:41,678
really really quickly with the support

2230
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:43,280
with the

2231
01:14:41,679 --> 01:14:45,600
the talent

2232
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:47,679
of a place like facebook i mean people

2233
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,600
often ask me what i would do differently

2234
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:51,440
um at instagram today and i say well i

2235
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,480
probably hire more carefully because we

2236
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:54,238
showed up

2237
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:57,839
just like before i knew it we had like

2238
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:58,959
100 people on the team and 200 and 300 i

2239
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,640
don't know where all these people were

2240
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,480
coming from i never had to recruit them

2241
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:04,960
i never had to screen them they were

2242
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:06,559
just like internal transfers right

2243
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:09,439
so it's like relying on the facebook

2244
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:11,440
hiring machine which is quite sort of

2245
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:13,359
i mean it's an elaborate machine it's

2246
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:15,198
and it's great by the way they have

2247
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:18,960
really talented people there

2248
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:18,960
but my point is um

2249
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:23,119
the choice was like take this thing put

2250
01:15:21,439 --> 01:15:25,678
it on the side of a rocket ship that you

2251
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:27,359
know is growing very quickly

2252
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:29,920
like i had seen what had happened when

2253
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:31,920
ev sold blogger to google and then

2254
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,399
google went public remember we sold

2255
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,319
before facebook went public

2256
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:38,639
there was a moment at which the stock

2257
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:40,960
price was 17 by the way the facebook

2258
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:43,679
stock price was 17 i remember thinking

2259
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,960
what the f did i just do right

2260
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:48,158
uh now at

2261
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,439
320-ish i don't know where we are today

2262
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:51,759
but like

2263
01:15:49,439 --> 01:15:54,238
okay like

2264
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,840
the best thing by the way is like

2265
01:15:54,238 --> 01:15:57,919
when the stock is down everyone calls

2266
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:59,360
you dope and then when it's up they also

2267
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:00,880
call you a dope but just for a different

2268
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:03,279
reason

2269
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:05,039
right like you can't win lesson in there

2270
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:07,039
somewhere yeah so but you know the

2271
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:09,279
choice is to stripe yourself to a rocket

2272
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:11,039
ship or to build your own you know mr

2273
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:13,840
elon built his own

2274
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:16,800
literally with the rocket ship

2275
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:18,239
that's a difficult choice because um

2276
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:19,600
there's a world

2277
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:22,000
actually i would say something different

2278
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,199
which is elon and others decided to sell

2279
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,319
paypal

2280
01:16:23,198 --> 01:16:25,839
for

2281
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:27,198
not that much i mean how much was it

2282
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:28,800
about a billion dollars i can't remember

2283
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:31,119
something like that yeah i mean it was

2284
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:33,039
early and um but it's worth a lot more

2285
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:35,279
an hour and then build a new rocket ship

2286
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:36,238
so this is the cool part right if you

2287
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:37,840
are

2288
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:40,399
an entrepreneur and you own a

2289
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:42,079
controlling stake in the company

2290
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:43,839
not only is it really hard to do

2291
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:45,198
something else with your life because

2292
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:47,679
all of the

2293
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:49,759
you know value is tied up in you as a

2294
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,800
personality attached to this company

2295
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:52,880
right

2296
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,560
but if you sell it and you get yourself

2297
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,760
enough capital and you like have enough

2298
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,520
energy

2299
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,280
you could do another thing or 10 other

2300
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:00,719
things or in elon's case like a bunch of

2301
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:03,279
other things i don't know like i lost

2302
01:17:00,719 --> 01:17:05,119
count at this point um

2303
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:07,439
and it might have seemed silly at the

2304
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:10,319
time and sure like if you look back man

2305
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:12,238
paypal's worth a lot now right

2306
01:17:10,319 --> 01:17:14,319
but i don't know like do you think elon

2307
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:17,519
like cares about like are we gonna buy

2308
01:17:14,319 --> 01:17:20,960
pinterest or not like i just he is

2309
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:23,120
he created a a a massive capital that

2310
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,719
allowed him to do what he wants to do

2311
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:26,079
and that's awesome that's more freeing

2312
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,319
than anything because when you are an

2313
01:17:26,079 --> 01:17:29,920
entrepreneur attached to a company you

2314
01:17:28,319 --> 01:17:32,079
gotta stay at that company for a really

2315
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:34,079
long time it's really hard to remove

2316
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:37,279
yourself but i'm not sure how much he

2317
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:40,158
loved paypal versus spacex and tesla

2318
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:41,279
i have a sense that you love

2319
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:43,119
instagram

2320
01:17:41,279 --> 01:17:45,198
yeah i loved enough to like

2321
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:47,439
work for six years beyond that which is

2322
01:17:45,198 --> 01:17:49,919
rare which is very rare you chose but

2323
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:51,039
can i tell you why sure it's um

2324
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,760
please

2325
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:56,158
there are not a lot of companies that

2326
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:58,320
you can be part of where

2327
01:17:56,158 --> 01:17:59,599
the pope's like i would like to sign up

2328
01:17:58,319 --> 01:18:01,439
for your product like i'm not a

2329
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:03,600
religious person at all

2330
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:05,198
i'm really not um yeah but when you go

2331
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,039
to the vatican and you're like walking

2332
01:18:05,198 --> 01:18:08,399
among the giant columns and you're

2333
01:18:07,039 --> 01:18:09,439
hearing the music and everything and

2334
01:18:08,399 --> 01:18:11,198
like

2335
01:18:09,439 --> 01:18:12,639
the pope walks in and he wants to press

2336
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:15,759
the sign up button on your product like

2337
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:19,039
it's a moment in life okay um no matter

2338
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:19,039
what your persuasion okay

2339
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:23,839
the number of doors and experiences that

2340
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,679
that opened up was it was incredible i

2341
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,119
mean the people i got to meet the places

2342
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:29,679
i got to go

2343
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:31,920
um i assume maybe like a payments

2344
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:34,719
company is slightly different right

2345
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:37,359
but that's why like it was so fun and

2346
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:39,760
plus i truly believed we were building

2347
01:18:37,359 --> 01:18:42,000
such a great product and i loved loved

2348
01:18:39,760 --> 01:18:43,520
the game it wasn't about the money it

2349
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,198
was about the game

2350
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,719
do you think do you think you had the

2351
01:18:45,198 --> 01:18:49,279
guts to say no

2352
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:50,239
is that so his i often think about this

2353
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:52,158
like

2354
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:53,439
how hard is it for entrepreneur to say

2355
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:56,000
no because

2356
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,839
the peer pressure so every like

2357
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,760
basically the sea of entrepreneurs in

2358
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,760
silicon valley are going to tell you

2359
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,119
this is their dream

2360
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:05,920
the the the thing you were sitting

2361
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:07,359
before was is a dream to walk away from

2362
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,960
that is really

2363
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:12,960
it seems like nearly impossible

2364
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,880
because instagram

2365
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,279
could in 10 years

2366
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,159
be you know you could talk about google

2367
01:19:17,279 --> 01:19:21,920
you could be making self-driving cars

2368
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:24,960
and building rockets that go to mars and

2369
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:28,079
compete with spacex totally and so

2370
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,719
that's an interesting decision to say

2371
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:33,359
am i willing

2372
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:35,439
to risk it and the reason i also say

2373
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:37,839
it's an interesting decision because

2374
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:39,519
it feels like per previous discussion if

2375
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:42,000
you're launching a social

2376
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:43,600
uh social network company

2377
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:45,520
there's there's going to be that meeting

2378
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,760
whatever that number is if you're

2379
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,600
successful if if you're on this rocket

2380
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,560
ship of success there's going to be a

2381
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,480
meeting

2382
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,239
with one of the social media

2383
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:56,000
social network companies

2384
01:19:54,238 --> 01:19:58,238
that want to buy you

2385
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,640
uh whether it's facebook or twitter but

2386
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:02,959
it could also very well be google who

2387
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:05,360
seems to

2388
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,639
have like a graveyard of failed social

2389
01:20:05,359 --> 01:20:08,000
networks

2390
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:09,840
and it's

2391
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,600
i mean i don't know i i i think about

2392
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:13,600
that how difficult it is for the

2393
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:15,280
entrepreneur to make that decision

2394
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,159
how many have successfully made that

2395
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:20,639
decision i guess this is a big question

2396
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:22,479
it's sad to me to be honest that too

2397
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:24,880
many make that decision perhaps for the

2398
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:26,879
wrong reason to to so when you say make

2399
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,880
the decision you mean to the affirmative

2400
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:32,319
affirmative you got it yeah there are

2401
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:34,159
also companies that don't sell right and

2402
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:36,079
take the path and say we're going to be

2403
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:37,198
independent and then you've never heard

2404
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:40,719
of them again

2405
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:42,638
like i remember uh path right was one of

2406
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,760
our competitors early on

2407
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:47,760
uh there's a big moment when they had i

2408
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:50,639
can't remember what it was like 110

2409
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:52,480
million offer from google or something

2410
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:54,000
it might have been larger i don't know

2411
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:55,678
um

2412
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,600
and i remember there was like this big

2413
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:59,600
techcrunch article that was like they

2414
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:03,280
turned it down after talking deeply

2415
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:04,960
about their values and everything and

2416
01:21:03,279 --> 01:21:06,960
i don't i don't know the inner workings

2417
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:09,279
of foursquare but like i'm certain there

2418
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,319
were many conversations over time where

2419
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:12,960
there were companies that wanted

2420
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:15,840
foursquare as well um recently

2421
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:17,359
like i mean what other companies

2422
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,279
there's clubhouse right like i don't

2423
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:20,559
know maybe people were really interested

2424
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:21,519
in them too

2425
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:23,840
like

2426
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:26,159
there are plenty of moments

2427
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:28,000
where people say no

2428
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:30,638
and we just forget that those things

2429
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,520
happen we only focus on the ones where

2430
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:34,239
like

2431
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:36,400
uh uh they said yes and like wow like

2432
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:38,399
what if they had stayed independent so i

2433
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:39,839
don't know i like i used to think a lot

2434
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:42,960
about this and now i just don't because

2435
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,719
i'm like whatever i you know like things

2436
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,319
have gone pretty well yeah

2437
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:48,880
i'm ready for the next game i mean think

2438
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:50,158
about um an athlete

2439
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,239
where

2440
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:53,679
i don't know maybe they they they do

2441
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:55,599
something wrong in the world series or

2442
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:58,319
whatever and like if you let it haunt

2443
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,600
you for the rest of your career like

2444
01:21:58,319 --> 01:22:03,198
why not just be like i don't know it was

2445
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:05,440
a game next game next shot right and if

2446
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:08,000
if you just move to that world like at

2447
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:09,519
least i have a next shot right no that's

2448
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,520
that's beautiful but i mean just in

2449
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:14,639
insights uh and it's funny you brought

2450
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,880
up clubhouse it is very true it seems

2451
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:17,760
like clubhouse is uh

2452
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:19,840
you know

2453
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,199
on the downward path and it's very

2454
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:25,119
possible to see

2455
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:27,119
a billion plus dollar deal at some stage

2456
01:22:25,119 --> 01:22:28,800
maybe like a year ago or half a year ago

2457
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:31,760
from facebook from google i think

2458
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:33,679
facebook was flirting with that idea too

2459
01:22:31,760 --> 01:22:34,639
and i think a lot of companies probably

2460
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:37,440
were

2461
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:40,079
i wish it was more public

2462
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:42,079
you know what there's not like a badass

2463
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:44,479
public story about them making the

2464
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:46,238
decision to walk away we just don't hear

2465
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:48,000
about it and then we get to see the the

2466
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:50,399
results of that success or the failure

2467
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:52,719
more often failure

2468
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:54,399
so a couple things one is i would not

2469
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,158
assume clubhouse is down for the count

2470
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:59,519
at all they're young they have plenty of

2471
01:22:56,158 --> 01:23:01,359
money they're run by really smart people

2472
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,639
i'd give them like a very fighting

2473
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:04,319
chance to figure it out there are a lot

2474
01:23:02,639 --> 01:23:05,760
of times when people call twitter down

2475
01:23:04,319 --> 01:23:08,238
for the count and they figure it out and

2476
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,400
they seem to be doing well right yeah um

2477
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:12,959
so just backing up like and not knowing

2478
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:15,039
anything about their internals like

2479
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:16,639
there's a strong chance they will figure

2480
01:23:15,039 --> 01:23:17,920
it out and that people are just down

2481
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,359
because they like being down about

2482
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,039
companies they like assuming that

2483
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:22,399
they're going to fail so who knows right

2484
01:23:21,039 --> 01:23:24,560
but let's take the ones in the past

2485
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:26,238
where like we know how it played out

2486
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:28,159
there are plenty of examples where

2487
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:30,000
people have turned down big offers and

2488
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:31,839
then you've just never heard from them

2489
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:33,600
again but we never focus on the

2490
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:37,840
companies because you just forget that

2491
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:37,840
those were big but inside your psyche

2492
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:42,079
i think they're um

2493
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,920
it's easy for someone with enough money

2494
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:46,000
to say money doesn't matter which i

2495
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:49,119
think is like it's of course

2496
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:50,880
money matters to people um

2497
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:53,119
but at the moment you just can't even

2498
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,239
grasp like the number of zeros that

2499
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:55,679
you're talking about it just doesn't

2500
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:56,559
make sense

2501
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:58,639
right

2502
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,719
so to think rationally in that moment is

2503
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:03,119
not something many people are equipped

2504
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:04,800
to do especially not people where i

2505
01:24:03,119 --> 01:24:06,880
think we had founded the company a year

2506
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:09,760
earlier maybe two years earlier like a

2507
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,840
year and a half we were 13 people

2508
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,920
but um i will say

2509
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:15,199
i still don't know if it was the right

2510
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,960
decision because i don't have that

2511
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:18,479
counterfactual i don't know that other

2512
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:20,319
world

2513
01:24:18,479 --> 01:24:22,638
i'm just thankful that

2514
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:23,759
by and large most people love instagram

2515
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:26,000
still do

2516
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,079
by and large people are very happy with

2517
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,679
like the time we had there

2518
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:30,639
um and i'm proud of what we built so

2519
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:33,359
like

2520
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:35,520
i'm cool like we're you know now now

2521
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:38,399
it's it's next shot right

2522
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:41,040
well if we could just linger on this

2523
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:43,599
yankees versus red sox the fun of it the

2524
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:45,359
competition over i would say over the

2525
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,719
space of features

2526
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:49,119
so um

2527
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:50,639
there are a bunch of features

2528
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:52,000
like there's

2529
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,319
photos

2530
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:56,880
there's one minute videos on instagram

2531
01:24:54,319 --> 01:24:58,799
there's igtv there's stories there's

2532
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:01,359
reels there's live

2533
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:04,159
so that sounds like it's like a long

2534
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:06,158
list of too much stuff but it's it's not

2535
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:07,679
because it feels like they're

2536
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:09,519
they're close together but they're

2537
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:11,279
somehow like what we're saying

2538
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:13,280
fundamentally distinct like each of the

2539
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:15,840
things i mentioned

2540
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:17,439
maybe can you describe the philosophies

2541
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:19,600
the design philosophies behind some of

2542
01:25:17,439 --> 01:25:21,198
these how you were thinking about it

2543
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:24,159
during the uh

2544
01:25:21,198 --> 01:25:27,198
the historic war between snapchat and

2545
01:25:24,158 --> 01:25:29,198
instagram or just in general like

2546
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:31,759
this space of features that was

2547
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:34,479
discovered there's this um

2548
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:36,639
great book by clay christensen called

2549
01:25:34,479 --> 01:25:39,119
competing against luck it's like a

2550
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:42,560
terrible uh title

2551
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:44,800
but within it there's uh effectively an

2552
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,480
expression of this thing called jobs to

2553
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:48,560
be done theory

2554
01:25:46,479 --> 01:25:50,079
and it's unclear if like he came up with

2555
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,520
it or some of his colleagues but

2556
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:52,880
everyone there are a bunch of places you

2557
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:54,880
can find with people claiming to have

2558
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:57,600
come up with this jobs to be done theory

2559
01:25:54,880 --> 01:26:00,239
but the idea is if you if you like

2560
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:03,039
zoom out and you look at your product

2561
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:04,799
you ask yourself why are people hiring

2562
01:26:03,039 --> 01:26:06,880
your product

2563
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,679
like imagine every product in your life

2564
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:11,760
is effectively an employee

2565
01:26:09,679 --> 01:26:13,199
you know your ceo of your life and you

2566
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:15,119
hire products to be employees

2567
01:26:13,198 --> 01:26:16,638
effectively they all have roles and jobs

2568
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:18,639
right

2569
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,480
why are you hiring a product why do you

2570
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:21,679
want that product to perform something

2571
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:24,399
in your life and what like what are the

2572
01:26:21,679 --> 01:26:26,639
hidden reasons why uh you're you're in

2573
01:26:24,399 --> 01:26:28,638
love with this product

2574
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:31,520
instagram was about sharing your life

2575
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:34,079
with others visually period right

2576
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:36,639
why because you feel connected with them

2577
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:39,198
you get to show off

2578
01:26:36,639 --> 01:26:41,279
you get to feel good and and cared about

2579
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:43,839
right with likes and

2580
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:46,399
um and it turns out that

2581
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:49,520
that will i think forever define

2582
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:52,319
instagram and any product that serves

2583
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,360
that job is going to do very well

2584
01:26:52,319 --> 01:26:56,158
okay

2585
01:26:53,359 --> 01:26:59,599
stories let's take it as an example

2586
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:01,198
is very much serving that job in fact it

2587
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,360
serves it better than the original

2588
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:06,000
product because when you're large and

2589
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,679
have an enormous audience

2590
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:08,960
you're worried about people seeing your

2591
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:11,119
stuff or you're worried about being

2592
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,800
permanent so that a college admissions

2593
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:14,319
person is going to see your photo of you

2594
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:15,920
doing something and

2595
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:18,319
so it turns out that that is a more

2596
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,760
efficient way of performing that job

2597
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:22,479
than the original product was the

2598
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:24,560
original product still has its value

2599
01:27:22,479 --> 01:27:26,319
but at scale these two things together

2600
01:27:24,560 --> 01:27:27,120
work really really well

2601
01:27:26,319 --> 01:27:29,359
now

2602
01:27:27,119 --> 01:27:30,880
i will claim that other parts of the

2603
01:27:29,359 --> 01:27:32,880
product over time

2604
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:35,600
didn't perform that job as well i think

2605
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:38,880
igtv probably didn't right

2606
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:40,639
shopping is like completely unrelated to

2607
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:43,039
what i just described but it might work

2608
01:27:40,639 --> 01:27:44,960
i don't know right um

2609
01:27:43,039 --> 01:27:46,639
products i think

2610
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:48,399
products that succeed

2611
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:49,440
are products that all share this parent

2612
01:27:48,399 --> 01:27:51,599
node

2613
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:52,799
of like this job to be done that is in

2614
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,280
common and then they're just like

2615
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:57,279
different ways of doing it right

2616
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:58,800
apple i think does a great job with this

2617
01:27:57,279 --> 01:28:01,039
right it's like managing your digital

2618
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:04,079
life and all the products just work

2619
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:06,079
together they sink they like it's

2620
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:08,559
beautiful right

2621
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:10,238
even if they require like silly specific

2622
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:12,800
cords to work

2623
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:14,319
but they're all part of a system

2624
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,920
it's when you leave that system and you

2625
01:28:14,319 --> 01:28:17,679
start doing something weird that people

2626
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:19,359
start scratching their head

2627
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:20,880
and i think you are less successful so i

2628
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:22,399
think one of the challenges facebook has

2629
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,560
had throughout its life

2630
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:26,479
is that it has never fully i think

2631
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,120
appreciated the job to be done of the

2632
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:31,359
main product and what it's done is said

2633
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:32,880
oh there's a shiny object over there

2634
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:34,799
that starts getting some traction let's

2635
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:37,199
go copy that thing and then they're

2636
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,560
confused why it doesn't work like why

2637
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:41,198
doesn't it work it's because the people

2638
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:43,679
who show up for this don't want that

2639
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:45,839
it's different what's the purpose of

2640
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:48,319
facebook i remember i was a very early

2641
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:50,719
facebook user i was the reason i was

2642
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:52,238
personally excited about facebook

2643
01:28:50,719 --> 01:28:54,000
is um

2644
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:55,519
because you can first of all use your

2645
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:58,238
real name

2646
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:59,600
like i i can exist in this world it can

2647
01:28:58,238 --> 01:29:01,678
be like

2648
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:04,320
formally exist there's i i like

2649
01:29:01,679 --> 01:29:07,039
anonymity for certain things reddit and

2650
01:29:04,319 --> 01:29:07,840
so on but i want it to also exist

2651
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:10,319
uh

2652
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:12,239
not anonymously so that that can connect

2653
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:14,719
with other friends of mine

2654
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:15,919
not anonymously and there's a reliable

2655
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:18,719
way to know

2656
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:20,880
that i'm real and they're real and that

2657
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:24,319
we're connecting and though it's kind of

2658
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:26,000
like um i liked it for the for the

2659
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:27,039
reasons that people like linkedin i

2660
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,198
guess

2661
01:29:27,039 --> 01:29:31,600
but like without the form like not

2662
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:34,559
everybody is dressed up and being super

2663
01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,960
polite like more like with friends

2664
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:40,000
but then it became something much bigger

2665
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:42,719
than that i suppose there's a feed it

2666
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:45,920
it became this um

2667
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:46,719
i mean it became a place to

2668
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,800
get

2669
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:52,399
discover content

2670
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,840
to share content that's not just about

2671
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:55,119
connecting directly with friends i mean

2672
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:57,039
it becomes something else i don't even

2673
01:29:55,119 --> 01:29:59,599
know what it is really so you said

2674
01:29:57,039 --> 01:30:00,719
instagram is a place where you visually

2675
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,000
share your

2676
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,520
life

2677
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,600
what is facebook

2678
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,760
well let's go back to the founding of

2679
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,560
facebook and why it worked really well

2680
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,000
initially at harvard and then dartmouth

2681
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,000
and stanford and i can't remember

2682
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:16,800
probably mit there were like a handful

2683
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,920
of schools in that first tranche right

2684
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,679
um

2685
01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:21,679
it worked because there are communities

2686
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:23,760
that exist in the world

2687
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:25,440
that want to transact and when i say

2688
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,639
transact i don't mean commercially i

2689
01:30:25,439 --> 01:30:27,839
just mean

2690
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:29,679
they want to share they want to

2691
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:31,920
coordinate they want to communicate they

2692
01:30:29,679 --> 01:30:35,440
want a space for themselves

2693
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:37,840
and facebook at its best i think

2694
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:39,919
is that and if actually you look at the

2695
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,920
most popular products that facebook has

2696
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:44,079
built over time

2697
01:30:41,920 --> 01:30:47,679
if you look at things that like groups

2698
01:30:44,079 --> 01:30:50,000
marketplace groups is enormous yeah and

2699
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:51,440
groups is effectively like everyone can

2700
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,079
found their own little stanford or

2701
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:55,519
dartmouth or mit right and and find each

2702
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:57,359
other and and

2703
01:30:55,520 --> 01:31:00,480
and share and communicate about

2704
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:03,039
something that matters deeply to them

2705
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:05,839
that is the core of what facebook was

2706
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:08,960
built around and i think today

2707
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:12,159
is where it stands most uh most strongly

2708
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:13,920
yeah it's brilliant the groups i wish um

2709
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:16,238
i wish groups were done better it feels

2710
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,279
like it's not a first-class citizen i

2711
01:31:16,238 --> 01:31:19,279
know

2712
01:31:17,279 --> 01:31:20,639
i may be saying something without much

2713
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:22,559
knowledge but

2714
01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:24,239
it feels like it's uh it's kind of

2715
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,880
bolted on

2716
01:31:24,238 --> 01:31:28,000
while being used a lot it feels like

2717
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,719
there needs to be a little bit more

2718
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:32,000
structure in terms of discovery

2719
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:34,158
in terms of

2720
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:36,479
yeah like i mean look at reddit like red

2721
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:38,319
is basically groups yeah public and open

2722
01:31:36,479 --> 01:31:41,039
and a little bit a little bit crazy

2723
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:43,359
right in a good way yeah um but there's

2724
01:31:41,039 --> 01:31:45,679
clear product market fit for that

2725
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:47,198
specific use case and it doesn't have to

2726
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:48,719
be a college it can be anything it can

2727
01:31:47,198 --> 01:31:50,158
be a small group big group it can be

2728
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:52,239
group messaging

2729
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:54,960
facebook shines i think when it leans

2730
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:56,559
into that i think when there are other

2731
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,439
companies

2732
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:01,520
that just seem exciting and now all of a

2733
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:03,198
sudden the product shifts in some

2734
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,840
fundamental way to go

2735
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:07,279
try to compete with that other thing

2736
01:32:05,840 --> 01:32:08,560
that's when i think consumers get

2737
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:10,800
confused

2738
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,480
um even if you can be successful like

2739
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:14,400
even if you can compete with that other

2740
01:32:12,479 --> 01:32:16,638
company even if you can

2741
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:17,839
figure out how to bolt it on eventually

2742
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:19,600
you come back and you look at the app

2743
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:22,239
and you're like i just don't know why i

2744
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:24,159
opened this app like why like too many

2745
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:25,519
things going on and that was always a

2746
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:26,960
worry i mean you listed all the things

2747
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:29,280
at instagram and it almost gave me a

2748
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,880
heart attack like

2749
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:32,479
way too many things but i don't know

2750
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:35,760
entrepreneurs get bored they want to add

2751
01:32:32,479 --> 01:32:37,599
things they want to like right um

2752
01:32:35,760 --> 01:32:39,039
i don't have a good answer for it except

2753
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,120
for that um

2754
01:32:39,039 --> 01:32:43,760
i think being true to your original use

2755
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:46,158
case and not even original use case but

2756
01:32:43,760 --> 01:32:49,280
sorry actually not use case original job

2757
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:51,599
there are many use cases under that job

2758
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:54,639
being true to that and like being really

2759
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:57,039
good at it over time and and morphing as

2760
01:32:54,639 --> 01:32:58,560
as needs change

2761
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:00,158
i think that's how to make a company

2762
01:32:58,560 --> 01:33:02,400
last forever and

2763
01:33:00,158 --> 01:33:05,439
i mean honestly i like

2764
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:07,519
my main thesis about why facebook is in

2765
01:33:05,439 --> 01:33:08,879
the position it is today

2766
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,920
is

2767
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:16,159
if if they have had a series of product

2768
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:17,600
launches that delighted people over time

2769
01:33:16,158 --> 01:33:20,238
i think they'd be in a totally different

2770
01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:21,840
world so just like imagine for a moment

2771
01:33:20,238 --> 01:33:22,559
and by the way apple's entering this but

2772
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:24,480
like

2773
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,480
apple for so long just like product

2774
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:28,238
after product you couldn't wait for it

2775
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:29,839
you stood in line for it you talked

2776
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:32,158
about it you got excited

2777
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:33,199
amazon makes your life so easy it's like

2778
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:34,799
wow

2779
01:33:33,198 --> 01:33:37,519
i needed this thing and it showed up at

2780
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:39,039
my door two days later and like

2781
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,679
both of these companies by the way

2782
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:43,119
amazon apple have issues right there are

2783
01:33:41,679 --> 01:33:45,279
labor issues

2784
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:48,158
whether it's here in the us or in china

2785
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:49,840
there are environmental issues there are

2786
01:33:48,158 --> 01:33:52,638
but like when's the last time you heard

2787
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:54,159
like a large chorus being like

2788
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,079
these companies better pay for what

2789
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:58,559
they're doing on these things right

2790
01:33:56,079 --> 01:33:59,920
i think facebook's main issue today is

2791
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,000
like i

2792
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:03,600
you need to produce a hit if you don't

2793
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,520
produce hits

2794
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:07,679
it's really hard to keep consumers on

2795
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:09,360
your side then people just start picking

2796
01:34:07,679 --> 01:34:11,600
on you and for a variety of reasons

2797
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:12,880
whether it's right or wrong i'm not even

2798
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:16,079
going to place a judgment right here

2799
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,920
right now i'm just going to say that

2800
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:20,000
it is way better to be in a world where

2801
01:34:17,920 --> 01:34:21,760
you are producing hits and consumers

2802
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:23,760
love what you're doing

2803
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:25,360
because then they're on your side and i

2804
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:28,000
i think that's it's

2805
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:30,559
the past 10 years for facebook has been

2806
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,079
fairly hard on this dimension so and by

2807
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,000
hits it doesn't necessarily mean

2808
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:36,238
financial hits it feels like to me what

2809
01:34:34,000 --> 01:34:38,399
you're saying is something that brings a

2810
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:40,238
joy yeah a product that brings joy to

2811
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:41,519
some fraction of the population yeah i

2812
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:43,678
mean

2813
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:45,360
tick tock isn't just literally an

2814
01:34:43,679 --> 01:34:48,719
algorithm

2815
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:51,920
in some ways tick tock's content uh and

2816
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:53,920
algorithm have more sway now over the

2817
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:56,960
american psyche than facebook's

2818
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,960
algorithm right it's visual it's video

2819
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,880
by the way it's not defined by who you

2820
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:02,158
follow it's defined by some magical

2821
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,679
thing that by the way if someone wanted

2822
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:07,118
to tweak to show you a certain type of

2823
01:35:03,679 --> 01:35:08,560
content for some reason they could right

2824
01:35:07,118 --> 01:35:10,639
um

2825
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:13,840
but people love it

2826
01:35:10,639 --> 01:35:17,039
so as a ceo let me ask you a question

2827
01:35:13,840 --> 01:35:17,039
because leadership matters

2828
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:22,800
it's a complicated question

2829
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:25,359
why is mark zuckerberg distrusted

2830
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:28,159
disliked and sometimes even hated by

2831
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:30,000
many people in public

2832
01:35:28,158 --> 01:35:32,399
right that is a complicated question um

2833
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:34,560
well the premise

2834
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:38,000
i'm not sure i agree with the premise um

2835
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:40,719
and i can i can expand that to include

2836
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:44,399
even a more mysterious question for me

2837
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:44,399
bill gates hmm

2838
01:35:44,639 --> 01:35:47,199
what is the bill gates version of the

2839
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:49,600
question

2840
01:35:47,198 --> 01:35:52,238
do you think people hate bill gates

2841
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:56,639
no distrust ah

2842
01:35:52,238 --> 01:35:58,399
so uh take away one it's a checklist uh

2843
01:35:56,639 --> 01:36:00,319
there's

2844
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:02,879
i think mark zuckerberg's distrust is

2845
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:05,118
the primary one but there's also like a

2846
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:08,079
like a dislike maybe hate is too strong

2847
01:36:05,118 --> 01:36:09,920
award but just if you look at like

2848
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:12,158
the articles that are being written and

2849
01:36:09,920 --> 01:36:14,639
so on

2850
01:36:12,158 --> 01:36:16,559
there's a dislike and it makes it's

2851
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:18,560
confusing to me because it's like the

2852
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:19,760
public picks certain individuals and

2853
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:21,280
they

2854
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:23,520
and they attach certain kinds of

2855
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:25,599
emotions to those individuals yeah so

2856
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,280
someone once uh

2857
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:29,920
just recently said

2858
01:36:27,279 --> 01:36:31,679
there's a strong case that founder-led

2859
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:35,039
companies have this problem and that a

2860
01:36:31,679 --> 01:36:37,279
lot of mark's issues um come today come

2861
01:36:35,039 --> 01:36:39,600
from the fact that he is a visible

2862
01:36:37,279 --> 01:36:40,880
founder with this

2863
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:42,800
story

2864
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:44,480
that people have watched in both a movie

2865
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,239
and they followed along and he's this

2866
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:48,238
boy wonder kid who became one of the

2867
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:50,638
world's richest people and

2868
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:53,118
and he's no longer mark the person he's

2869
01:36:50,639 --> 01:36:55,520
marked this this image of of a person

2870
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:58,880
with enormous wealth and power

2871
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:01,199
and in today's world we we have issues

2872
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:02,880
with enormous wealth and power for a

2873
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:04,638
variety of reasons one of which is we've

2874
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,199
been stuck inside

2875
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:09,520
you know for a year and a half two years

2876
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:11,599
uh one of which is a lot of people were

2877
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:13,679
really unhappy about not the last

2878
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:15,280
election but the last last election

2879
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:18,239
and where do you take out that anger who

2880
01:37:15,279 --> 01:37:20,559
do you blame but the people in charge

2881
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:21,439
that's one example or one reason why i

2882
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:24,000
think

2883
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:26,559
um a lot of people

2884
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:28,800
uh express anger or resentment or

2885
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:31,119
unhappiness with

2886
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,400
with mark at the same time

2887
01:37:31,118 --> 01:37:34,719
i don't know i pointed out to that

2888
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:37,039
person i was like well i don't know like

2889
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:38,079
i think a lot of people really like elon

2890
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:40,158
like

2891
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:41,840
ilana arguably like he kept his you know

2892
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:45,198
factory open here throughout covet

2893
01:37:41,840 --> 01:37:47,119
protocols which arguably a lot of people

2894
01:37:45,198 --> 01:37:49,279
would be against um

2895
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:51,439
while saying a bunch of uh

2896
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:54,719
crazy offensive things on the internet

2897
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:56,799
they still like basically you know

2898
01:37:54,719 --> 01:37:58,319
gives the middle finger to the sec like

2899
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:59,920
on twitter and like

2900
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:02,158
i don't know i'm like well there's a

2901
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:04,960
founder and like people kind of like him

2902
01:38:02,158 --> 01:38:08,479
i so i do think that

2903
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:10,800
the so like the the founder and slash

2904
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:12,879
ceo of a company that's a social network

2905
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:15,279
company is like an extra level of

2906
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:17,600
difficulty if if life is a video game

2907
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:19,439
you just chose the harder video game

2908
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:21,520
so i mean that's why it's interesting to

2909
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:23,839
ask you because you were the

2910
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:26,239
founder and the ceo oh yeah of a social

2911
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:30,639
network right challenge because exactly

2912
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:33,198
so but you're one of the rare

2913
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:35,279
even jack dorsey's disliked

2914
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:37,198
not to the degree but it just seems

2915
01:38:35,279 --> 01:38:40,079
harder when you're running a social

2916
01:38:37,198 --> 01:38:41,599
media company it's interesting i i never

2917
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:44,960
thought of jack as just like i think

2918
01:38:41,600 --> 01:38:46,960
generally he's well respected um

2919
01:38:44,960 --> 01:38:48,560
yeah i think so i i think you're right

2920
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,399
but like he's

2921
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:51,280
but he's not loved

2922
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:53,439
yeah

2923
01:38:51,279 --> 01:38:55,519
and i feel like you i mean to me twitter

2924
01:38:53,439 --> 01:38:57,359
is an incredible thing yeah

2925
01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:00,159
again can i just come back to this point

2926
01:38:57,359 --> 01:39:01,920
which seems over simplistic but like i

2927
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:04,799
really do think

2928
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:07,279
how a product makes someone feel yeah

2929
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:08,320
they ascribe that feeling to the founder

2930
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:09,840
yep

2931
01:39:08,319 --> 01:39:12,158
uh

2932
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:13,840
so so make people feel good so think

2933
01:39:12,158 --> 01:39:15,599
about it like let's just go with this

2934
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:16,960
thesis for a second sure i like it

2935
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:19,520
though um

2936
01:39:16,960 --> 01:39:21,439
amazon's pretty utilitarian right it

2937
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,920
delivers brown boxes to your front door

2938
01:39:21,439 --> 01:39:25,359
sure you can have alexa and you can have

2939
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:28,079
all these things right

2940
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:31,359
but in general it delivers stuff quickly

2941
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:33,519
to you at a reasonable price right

2942
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:36,639
i think jeff bezos is wonderfully

2943
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:38,480
wealthy thoughtful smart guy right but

2944
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:40,159
like people kind of feel that way about

2945
01:39:38,479 --> 01:39:41,919
them they're like wow this is really big

2946
01:39:40,158 --> 01:39:42,719
we're impressed that this is really big

2947
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:45,039
and

2948
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:46,719
but they he's doing the same space stuff

2949
01:39:45,039 --> 01:39:49,519
elon's doing but they don't necessarily

2950
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:51,840
describe the same sense of wonder right

2951
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:53,840
um now let's take elon uh and again this

2952
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:56,400
is pet theory i don't have much proof

2953
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:59,679
other than my own intuition um

2954
01:39:56,399 --> 01:40:02,319
he is literally about living the future

2955
01:39:59,679 --> 01:40:04,079
mars space it's about wonder it's about

2956
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:06,000
going back to that feeling as a kid when

2957
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:09,198
you looked up to the stars and asked is

2958
01:40:06,000 --> 01:40:11,118
there life out there people get behind

2959
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:14,000
that because it's a sense of hope and

2960
01:40:11,118 --> 01:40:16,079
excitement and and innovation and like

2961
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:18,880
you can say whatever you want but we

2962
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:21,039
ascribe that emotion to that person

2963
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:23,039
now let's say you're on a social network

2964
01:40:21,039 --> 01:40:24,479
and people make you kind of angry

2965
01:40:23,039 --> 01:40:26,079
because they disagree with you or they

2966
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:27,039
say something ridiculous or they're

2967
01:40:26,079 --> 01:40:28,800
living

2968
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:31,679
a fomo type life where you're like wow i

2969
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:33,440
wish i was doing that thing

2970
01:40:31,679 --> 01:40:36,079
i think instagram if i were to think

2971
01:40:33,439 --> 01:40:38,638
back by and large when i was there was

2972
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:40,238
not about fomo was not about this

2973
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:42,319
influence or economy although it

2974
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:43,439
certainly became that way closer to the

2975
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:45,118
end

2976
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:46,799
it was about the sense of wonder and

2977
01:40:45,118 --> 01:40:48,079
happiness and beautiful things in the

2978
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:49,760
world and

2979
01:40:48,079 --> 01:40:50,800
i don't know i mean like i don't want to

2980
01:40:49,760 --> 01:40:52,960
have a blind spot but i don't think

2981
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,320
anyone had a strong opinion about one

2982
01:40:52,960 --> 01:40:55,920
way or the other for the longest time

2983
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:57,840
the way people explain to me i mean if

2984
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:00,319
you want to go for toxicity you go to

2985
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:02,000
facebook or twitter if you want to go to

2986
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:04,319
make feel good about life you go to

2987
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:05,760
instagram to enjoy celebrate life though

2988
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:07,279
and my experience when talking to people

2989
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,360
is they gave me the benefit of the doubt

2990
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:11,519
because that but if your experience of

2991
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:13,439
the product is kind of makes you angry

2992
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,199
it's where you argue

2993
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:17,118
i mean a big part of jack might be that

2994
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:19,439
he wasn't actually the ceo for a very

2995
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:21,279
long time and only became recently so

2996
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:22,399
i'm not sure how much of the connection

2997
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:23,519
got made

2998
01:41:22,399 --> 01:41:26,238
um

2999
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,000
but in general i mean if you hate you

3000
01:41:26,238 --> 01:41:29,519
know

3001
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,198
i'm just thinking about other companies

3002
01:41:29,520 --> 01:41:33,280
that aren't tech companies if you hate

3003
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:36,158
like what a company is doing or it makes

3004
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:37,439
you not feel happy

3005
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:39,359
i don't know like people are really

3006
01:41:37,439 --> 01:41:40,879
angry about comcast or whatever are they

3007
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:42,319
even called comcast anymore it's like

3008
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:46,159
xfinity or something right they had to

3009
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:48,238
rebrand they they became meta right um

3010
01:41:46,158 --> 01:41:50,079
it's like uh but my point is if it makes

3011
01:41:48,238 --> 01:41:53,039
you that's beautiful yeah

3012
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:53,039
but the thing is

3013
01:41:53,439 --> 01:41:57,279
this is me saying this i think your

3014
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,719
thesis is very

3015
01:41:57,279 --> 01:42:01,679
strong and correct

3016
01:41:58,719 --> 01:42:03,520
has elements of correctness but i still

3017
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:06,158
personally

3018
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:07,440
put some blame on individuals of course

3019
01:42:06,158 --> 01:42:08,479
i think uh

3020
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:11,359
you said

3021
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:13,439
elon looking up there's something about

3022
01:42:11,359 --> 01:42:16,399
childlike wander to him

3023
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:17,919
like to to his personality his character

3024
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:20,238
something about

3025
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:22,319
i think more so than others where people

3026
01:42:20,238 --> 01:42:24,399
can trust them and there's uh i don't

3027
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:26,319
know santa pachai is an example of

3028
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:27,839
somebody who's like

3029
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:29,679
there's some kind

3030
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:32,000
it's it's hard to put into words but

3031
01:42:29,679 --> 01:42:34,880
there's something about the human being

3032
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:36,079
where he's trustworthy yeah he's he's

3033
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,319
human

3034
01:42:36,079 --> 01:42:39,840
in a way that uh connects to us and the

3035
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:43,679
same with uh

3036
01:42:39,840 --> 01:42:46,000
sadji nadella i mean some of these folks

3037
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:47,920
um something about

3038
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:51,198
us is drawn to them even when they're

3039
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:53,359
flawed even like um so like your thesis

3040
01:42:51,198 --> 01:42:55,039
really holds up for steve jobs because i

3041
01:42:53,359 --> 01:42:57,039
think people didn't like steve jobs but

3042
01:42:55,039 --> 01:42:58,880
like he delivered products

3043
01:42:57,039 --> 01:43:01,118
that and then they fell in love every

3044
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:03,118
time

3045
01:43:01,118 --> 01:43:05,599
i guess you could say that the ceo the

3046
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:07,439
leader is also a product

3047
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,800
and if they keep delivering a product

3048
01:43:07,439 --> 01:43:10,479
that people like

3049
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,039
by being in public and saying things

3050
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:14,479
that people like that's also a way to

3051
01:43:13,039 --> 01:43:16,238
make people happy

3052
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:17,279
but from a social network perspective it

3053
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:19,678
makes me

3054
01:43:17,279 --> 01:43:21,519
wonder how difficult it is

3055
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:23,279
to explain to people why certain things

3056
01:43:21,520 --> 01:43:26,320
happen like how to explain machine

3057
01:43:23,279 --> 01:43:27,359
learning to explain why

3058
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:28,319
certain

3059
01:43:27,359 --> 01:43:30,319
uh

3060
01:43:28,319 --> 01:43:33,279
the

3061
01:43:30,319 --> 01:43:36,319
the woke mob effect happens or the

3062
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:37,599
certain kinds of like bullying happens

3063
01:43:36,319 --> 01:43:39,920
which is like

3064
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:41,760
it's human nature combined with

3065
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:43,199
algorithm and it's very difficult to

3066
01:43:41,760 --> 01:43:45,440
control for how the spread of

3067
01:43:43,198 --> 01:43:47,678
quote-unquote misinformation happens

3068
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:49,759
it's very difficult to control for that

3069
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:51,199
and to you so you try to decelerate

3070
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:54,239
certain parts and you create more

3071
01:43:51,198 --> 01:43:55,919
problems then you solve and anything

3072
01:43:54,238 --> 01:43:57,519
that looks at all like censorship can

3073
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,840
create huge amounts of problems that's

3074
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:02,159
the slippery slope and then you have to

3075
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,760
inject humans to oversee the machine

3076
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:05,599
learning algorithms and anytime you

3077
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:07,440
inject humans into the system it's gonna

3078
01:44:05,600 --> 01:44:08,880
create a huge number of problems and i

3079
01:44:07,439 --> 01:44:10,799
feel like it's up to the leader to

3080
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:12,400
communicate that effectively to be

3081
01:44:10,800 --> 01:44:14,000
transparent

3082
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:15,599
uh first of all design products that

3083
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,520
don't have those problems and second of

3084
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:19,199
all when they have those problems to be

3085
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,960
able to communicate with them i guess

3086
01:44:19,198 --> 01:44:23,039
that's all going to

3087
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:25,039
when you run a social network company

3088
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:25,840
your job is hard

3089
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:27,760
yeah

3090
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:29,199
i will say the one element that you

3091
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:31,520
haven't named that i think you're

3092
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:34,399
getting at is just bedside manner

3093
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:36,000
which steve jobs

3094
01:44:34,399 --> 01:44:38,479
i never worked for him i never met him

3095
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,158
in person um

3096
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:42,718
had an enor like

3097
01:44:40,158 --> 01:44:44,399
an uncanny ability in public to have

3098
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:46,319
bedside manner i mean some of the best

3099
01:44:44,399 --> 01:44:48,479
clips of steve jobs

3100
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:50,799
are from like i would say

3101
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:52,559
maybe the 80s when he's on these stage

3102
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,239
and getting questions from the audience

3103
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:56,000
about life or

3104
01:44:54,238 --> 01:44:57,919
and he'll take this question that is

3105
01:44:56,000 --> 01:44:59,679
like how are you going to compete with

3106
01:44:57,920 --> 01:45:01,760
blah and it's super boring and i don't

3107
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:04,639
even know the name of the coming and his

3108
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:07,039
answer is is if you just asked like your

3109
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:08,239
grandfather the meaning of life yeah

3110
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:10,560
yeah and you sit there and you're just

3111
01:45:08,238 --> 01:45:13,039
like what like yeah and there's that

3112
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:14,639
bedside manner um

3113
01:45:13,039 --> 01:45:16,399
and if you lack that or if that's just

3114
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:18,480
not intuitive to you

3115
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:21,039
uh i think that

3116
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:23,439
it can be a lot harder to gain the trust

3117
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:26,479
of people and then add on top of that

3118
01:45:23,439 --> 01:45:28,000
missteps of companies right

3119
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:30,000
it's i don't know if you have any

3120
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:32,238
friends from the past where like maybe

3121
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:33,520
they crossed you once or like

3122
01:45:32,238 --> 01:45:35,678
maybe you get back together and you're

3123
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:37,760
friends again but you just never really

3124
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:41,600
forget that thing it's human nature not

3125
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:43,199
to forget i'm russian you cost me one

3126
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,440
we solve the problem

3127
01:45:43,198 --> 01:45:47,519
so my point is

3128
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:49,439
it there's

3129
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:50,960
humans don't forget and if there are

3130
01:45:49,439 --> 01:45:52,319
times in the past where they feel like

3131
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:55,039
they don't trust the company or the

3132
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:56,960
company hasn't had their back

3133
01:45:55,039 --> 01:45:58,158
that is really hard to earn back

3134
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:01,118
especially if you don't have that

3135
01:45:58,158 --> 01:46:02,799
bedside manner um and again like i'm not

3136
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:05,198
attributing this specifically to mark

3137
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:08,480
because i think a lot of companies

3138
01:46:05,198 --> 01:46:08,479
have this issue where

3139
01:46:08,719 --> 01:46:12,079
one you have to be trustworthy as a

3140
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:14,079
company and live by it and live by those

3141
01:46:12,079 --> 01:46:16,800
actions and then two i think you need to

3142
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:18,639
be able to be really relatable in a way

3143
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:20,960
that's very difficult if you're worth

3144
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:22,000
like what these people are it's really

3145
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,198
hard

3146
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:25,520
yeah

3147
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:28,000
jack does a pretty good job of this

3148
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:30,960
by being a monk but i also like jack

3149
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:33,039
issues attention like he's not out there

3150
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,039
almost on purpose he's just working hard

3151
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:37,118
doing square right like

3152
01:46:35,039 --> 01:46:39,760
i literally shared a desk like this with

3153
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:41,679
him at audio i mean just normal guy who

3154
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:43,920
likes painting i like i remember he

3155
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:46,560
would leave early on like wednesdays or

3156
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:49,359
something to go to like a painting class

3157
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:50,400
yeah and he's creative he's thoughtful i

3158
01:46:49,359 --> 01:46:52,158
mean

3159
01:46:50,399 --> 01:46:53,599
money makes people like more creative

3160
01:46:52,158 --> 01:46:56,000
and more thoughtful like extreme

3161
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:57,760
versions of themselves right um and this

3162
01:46:56,000 --> 01:47:00,319
was a long long time ago

3163
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:02,560
uh you mentioned that he uh he asked you

3164
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:04,000
to do some kind of javascript thing

3165
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,239
we were working on some javascript

3166
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,238
together i like that's hilarious like

3167
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:11,039
pre-twitter early twitter days you and

3168
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:13,198
jack dorsey are in a room together

3169
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:15,439
talking about javascript solving some

3170
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:16,799
kind of menial problem terrible problems

3171
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:18,559
yeah i mean not terrible just like

3172
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:20,400
boring boring widget probably i think it

3173
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:21,440
was the odo widget we were working on at

3174
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:23,519
the time

3175
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:25,039
i'm surprised anyone paid me to be in

3176
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:26,960
the room as an intern because i didn't

3177
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:28,000
really provide any value i'm very

3178
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:30,000
thankful

3179
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,800
to anyone who included me back in the

3180
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:35,359
day uh it was very helpful so thank you

3181
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:38,719
for listening i mean is there uh

3182
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:39,839
odia that's a precursor to twitter

3183
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:42,000
first of all did you have any

3184
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,039
anticipation that this jack dorsey guy

3185
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:46,158
could be

3186
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:48,479
also a head of a major social network

3187
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:50,960
and um second did you learn anything

3188
01:47:48,479 --> 01:47:52,879
from the guy that like did do do you

3189
01:47:50,960 --> 01:47:55,118
think it's a coincidence that you two

3190
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:56,400
were in the room together

3191
01:47:55,118 --> 01:47:58,880
and it's

3192
01:47:56,399 --> 01:48:01,118
the coincidence meaning like

3193
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:03,039
why does the world play its game in a

3194
01:48:01,118 --> 01:48:05,039
certain way were these two founders of

3195
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:07,600
social networks i don't know it's so

3196
01:48:05,039 --> 01:48:10,000
weird right like i i mean it's also

3197
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:11,440
weird that

3198
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,359
mark showed up

3199
01:48:11,439 --> 01:48:14,799
you know in our fraternity my sophomore

3200
01:48:13,359 --> 01:48:16,960
year and

3201
01:48:14,800 --> 01:48:18,960
we got to know each other then like long

3202
01:48:16,960 --> 01:48:21,920
before instagram it's

3203
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:24,880
it's a small world but

3204
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:27,440
let me tell a fun story about jack um

3205
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:29,039
we're at odio and i don't know i think

3206
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:31,198
ev was feeling like people weren't

3207
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:33,118
working hard enough or something

3208
01:48:31,198 --> 01:48:35,198
nice and

3209
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:38,799
i can't remember exactly what he he

3210
01:48:35,198 --> 01:48:40,479
created this thing where every friday

3211
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,960
i don't know if it was every friday i

3212
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:46,479
only remember this happening once

3213
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:49,679
but he had us like a statuette it's like

3214
01:48:46,479 --> 01:48:52,000
of mary and in the bottom it's it's

3215
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:54,480
hollow right and

3216
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:56,639
i remember on a friday he decided

3217
01:48:54,479 --> 01:48:58,479
decided he was going to let everyone

3218
01:48:56,639 --> 01:48:59,359
vote for who had worked the hardest that

3219
01:48:58,479 --> 01:49:01,599
week

3220
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:04,319
we all voted closed ballot right we all

3221
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:07,119
put in a bucket and he tallied the votes

3222
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:09,679
and then whoever got the most votes as i

3223
01:49:07,118 --> 01:49:11,279
recall got the statuette

3224
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:13,599
and in the statue it was a thousand

3225
01:49:11,279 --> 01:49:14,479
bucks whereas i recall there was a

3226
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:15,760
thousand bucks tonight it might have

3227
01:49:14,479 --> 01:49:16,959
been a hundred bucks but let's call it a

3228
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:18,719
thousand it's more exciting that way it

3229
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:20,639
felt like a thousand yeah it did to me

3230
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:22,480
for sure i actually got two votes i was

3231
01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,920
very happy we were a small company but i

3232
01:49:22,479 --> 01:49:25,279
as the intern i got at least two votes

3233
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:27,520
so everybody knew how many votes they

3234
01:49:25,279 --> 01:49:28,719
got individually yeah yeah i think it

3235
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,040
was one of these self-accountability

3236
01:49:28,719 --> 01:49:33,118
things anyway i remember jack just

3237
01:49:31,039 --> 01:49:34,880
getting like the vast majority of votes

3238
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:36,960
from everyone

3239
01:49:34,880 --> 01:49:38,800
and i remember just thinking like

3240
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:40,960
like i couldn't imagine he would become

3241
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:44,079
what he'd become and do what he would do

3242
01:49:40,960 --> 01:49:45,520
but i had a profound respect that

3243
01:49:44,079 --> 01:49:47,279
the new guy

3244
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,440
who i really liked

3245
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:52,158
worked that hard and you could see his

3246
01:49:49,439 --> 01:49:53,759
dedication even then and that people

3247
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:55,279
respected him

3248
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:57,039
that's the one story that i remember of

3249
01:49:55,279 --> 01:49:58,639
him like working with him specifically

3250
01:49:57,039 --> 01:50:00,238
from that summer can take a small

3251
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:02,000
tangent on that of course there's kind

3252
01:50:00,238 --> 01:50:04,238
of a push back in silicon valley a

3253
01:50:02,000 --> 01:50:07,039
little bit against hard work

3254
01:50:04,238 --> 01:50:09,198
can you speak to the sort of

3255
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:11,279
the thing you admire to see the new guy

3256
01:50:09,198 --> 01:50:12,879
working so hard that thing

3257
01:50:11,279 --> 01:50:15,599
what is the value of that thing in a

3258
01:50:12,880 --> 01:50:19,199
company see this is i like just to be

3259
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:21,039
very frank it drives me nuts like

3260
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:23,279
i saw this really funny video on tick

3261
01:50:21,039 --> 01:50:24,880
tock was it on tick tock it was like i'm

3262
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:26,559
taking a break from my mental health to

3263
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:27,359
work on my career i thought that was

3264
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:28,000
funny

3265
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:29,598
um

3266
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,880
[Laughter]

3267
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:32,480
yeah so it's like oh it is kind of

3268
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:35,039
phrased that way the opposite often

3269
01:50:32,479 --> 01:50:37,198
right yeah um okay so a couple things

3270
01:50:35,039 --> 01:50:39,679
uh

3271
01:50:37,198 --> 01:50:42,238
i uh

3272
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:44,319
i have worked so hard

3273
01:50:42,238 --> 01:50:47,439
to do the things that i did like

3274
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:50,000
mike and i lost years off of our lives

3275
01:50:47,439 --> 01:50:51,598
staying up late figuring things out

3276
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,439
the stress that comes with the job i

3277
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:54,719
have a lot more gray hair now than i did

3278
01:50:53,439 --> 01:50:56,960
back then

3279
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:59,279
it requires an enormous amount of work

3280
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:02,000
and most people aren't successful right

3281
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:04,158
but even the ones that do don't skate by

3282
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:06,719
um

3283
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:08,238
i am okay if people choose not to work

3284
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:09,760
hard because i don't actually think

3285
01:51:08,238 --> 01:51:12,959
there's anything in this world that says

3286
01:51:09,760 --> 01:51:15,199
you have to work hard um

3287
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:17,118
but i do think that great things require

3288
01:51:15,198 --> 01:51:18,799
a lot of hard work so there's no way you

3289
01:51:17,118 --> 01:51:20,639
can expect to change the world without

3290
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:22,480
working really hard and by the way

3291
01:51:20,639 --> 01:51:23,920
even changing the world

3292
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:25,439
you know the folks that i respect the

3293
01:51:23,920 --> 01:51:27,199
most have nudged the world in like a

3294
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:28,399
slight direction

3295
01:51:27,198 --> 01:51:30,799
slight

3296
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:31,598
very very slight

3297
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:33,840
like

3298
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:35,920
even if elon accomplishes all the things

3299
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:37,599
he wants to accomplish we will have uh

3300
01:51:35,920 --> 01:51:39,760
have nudged the world in a slight

3301
01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:41,199
direction but it requires enormous

3302
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:43,039
amount there was an interview with him

3303
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:44,638
where he was just like

3304
01:51:43,039 --> 01:51:46,399
he was interviewed i think at the tesla

3305
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:48,159
factory and he was like

3306
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:49,279
work is really hard this is actually

3307
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:51,519
unhealthy

3308
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:53,599
and i can't recall the exact but he was

3309
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:54,880
like visibly shaken about how hard he

3310
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:55,679
had been working and he was like this is

3311
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:57,199
bad

3312
01:51:55,679 --> 01:51:58,960
and unfortunately i think to have great

3313
01:51:57,198 --> 01:52:00,799
outcomes you actually do need to work at

3314
01:51:58,960 --> 01:52:01,679
like three standard deviations above the

3315
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,039
mean

3316
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:05,199
but there's nothing saying that people

3317
01:52:03,039 --> 01:52:07,198
have to go for this the thing is but

3318
01:52:05,198 --> 01:52:09,279
what i would argue this is my personal

3319
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:10,799
opinion is nobody has to do anything

3320
01:52:09,279 --> 01:52:13,519
first of all exactly they certainly

3321
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:15,199
don't have to work hard exactly but

3322
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:19,199
i think

3323
01:52:15,198 --> 01:52:22,238
hard work in a company should be admired

3324
01:52:19,198 --> 01:52:24,479
i do too and you should not feel

3325
01:52:22,238 --> 01:52:24,479
like

3326
01:52:24,639 --> 01:52:29,199
you shouldn't feel good about yourself

3327
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:29,920
for not working hard

3328
01:52:29,198 --> 01:52:32,319
like

3329
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:34,239
so for example i don't have to work out

3330
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:35,840
i don't have to run

3331
01:52:34,238 --> 01:52:38,000
i hate running

3332
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,760
but like i certainly don't feel good if

3333
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:41,679
i don't run because i know for my health

3334
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:43,199
like there's certain values i guess is

3335
01:52:41,679 --> 01:52:44,560
what i'm trying to get right the the

3336
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:46,000
certain values that you have in life it

3337
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:47,599
feels like there's certain values that

3338
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:49,840
companies should have and hard work is

3339
01:52:47,599 --> 01:52:51,840
one of the things um

3340
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:54,079
i think that should be admired i often

3341
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:56,000
ask this kind of silly question

3342
01:52:54,079 --> 01:52:58,479
uh just just to get a sense of people

3343
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:00,800
one that like if i'm hiring and so on i

3344
01:52:58,479 --> 01:53:02,959
just ask if they uh think it's better to

3345
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,800
work hard or work smart

3346
01:53:02,960 --> 01:53:07,198
it was helpful for me to

3347
01:53:04,800 --> 01:53:09,599
get a sense of people from that

3348
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:11,198
because you think like the right both

3349
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:13,760
was that the answer was the answer's

3350
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:16,079
both i usually try not to give them that

3351
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:19,599
but sometimes i'll say both if that's an

3352
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:21,920
option but a lot of people kind of

3353
01:53:19,599 --> 01:53:24,400
a surprising number will say work smart

3354
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:26,639
and they're usually people who don't

3355
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:28,719
know how to work smart

3356
01:53:26,639 --> 01:53:29,679
and uh they're they're literally just

3357
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:31,520
lazy

3358
01:53:29,679 --> 01:53:33,920
not just there's two there's two effects

3359
01:53:31,520 --> 01:53:34,719
behind that it's one is laziness and the

3360
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:35,520
other

3361
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:37,279
is

3362
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:38,719
ego

3363
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:41,679
when you're younger and you say it's

3364
01:53:38,719 --> 01:53:44,560
better to work smart it means

3365
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:46,719
you think you know what it means to work

3366
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:49,760
smart at this early stage

3367
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:51,599
to me people that say work hard or both

3368
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:54,000
they have the humility to understand

3369
01:53:51,599 --> 01:53:55,840
like i'm going to have to work my ass

3370
01:53:54,000 --> 01:53:57,439
off because i'm too dumb to know how to

3371
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:59,760
work smart and people who are

3372
01:53:57,439 --> 01:54:01,359
self-critical in this way in some small

3373
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,400
amount you have to have some confidence

3374
01:54:01,359 --> 01:54:04,238
but

3375
01:54:02,399 --> 01:54:05,839
you have if you have humility that means

3376
01:54:04,238 --> 01:54:07,598
you're going to actually eventually

3377
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,679
figure out what it means to work smart

3378
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:11,119
and then to actually be successful you

3379
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,920
should do both

3380
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:13,920
so

3381
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:17,039
i have a very particular take on this

3382
01:54:13,920 --> 01:54:17,039
which is that um

3383
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:22,158
no one's forcing you to do anything all

3384
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:23,039
choices have consequences

3385
01:54:22,158 --> 01:54:24,719
so

3386
01:54:23,039 --> 01:54:27,679
if you major in

3387
01:54:24,719 --> 01:54:28,880
i don't know theoretical literature i i

3388
01:54:27,679 --> 01:54:30,399
don't even know if that's a major i'm

3389
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:32,800
just making something up as opposed to

3390
01:54:30,399 --> 01:54:34,879
regular literature like if but like

3391
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,960
literature yeah think about like like

3392
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:39,520
theoretical yeah

3393
01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:41,599
spanish lit from the 14th century like

3394
01:54:39,520 --> 01:54:43,599
just make make up your esoteric thing

3395
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:44,960
and then the number of people i went to

3396
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:47,119
stanford with who get out in the world

3397
01:54:44,960 --> 01:54:50,239
are like wait what i can't find a job

3398
01:54:47,118 --> 01:54:51,598
like no one wants a theoretical like

3399
01:54:50,238 --> 01:54:53,198
there are plenty of counter examples of

3400
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:54,880
people have majored in esoteric things

3401
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:56,158
and gone on to be very successful so i

3402
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:57,440
just want to be clear it's not about the

3403
01:54:56,158 --> 01:54:59,039
major but

3404
01:54:57,439 --> 01:55:01,519
every choice you make

3405
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:03,679
whether it's to have kids like

3406
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:06,320
i love my children it's so awesome to

3407
01:55:03,679 --> 01:55:08,239
have two kids and it is so hard to work

3408
01:55:06,319 --> 01:55:10,799
really hard and also have kids it's

3409
01:55:08,238 --> 01:55:12,799
really hard and there's a reason why

3410
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:14,800
certain very successful people like

3411
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:16,400
don't have are not successful but people

3412
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:18,480
who run very very large companies or

3413
01:55:16,399 --> 01:55:20,000
startups have chosen not to have kids

3414
01:55:18,479 --> 01:55:21,519
for a while or chosen not to like

3415
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,359
prioritize them

3416
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:25,520
everything's a choice and like i choose

3417
01:55:23,359 --> 01:55:27,679
to prioritize my children because like i

3418
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:30,400
want to do that right

3419
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:32,960
so everything's a choice

3420
01:55:30,399 --> 01:55:35,519
now once you've made that choice

3421
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:37,279
i think it's important that the contract

3422
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:40,639
is clear which is to say let's imagine

3423
01:55:37,279 --> 01:55:42,639
you were joining a new startup

3424
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,400
it's important that that startup

3425
01:55:42,639 --> 01:55:45,760
communicate that like the expectation is

3426
01:55:44,399 --> 01:55:47,279
like we're all working really really

3427
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:48,639
hard right now you don't have to join

3428
01:55:47,279 --> 01:55:51,359
the startup

3429
01:55:48,639 --> 01:55:53,599
but like if you do just know like you're

3430
01:55:51,359 --> 01:55:55,679
it's almost as if you join i don't know

3431
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:57,840
pick your uh

3432
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:59,520
pick your pick your like sports team

3433
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:00,719
like let's go back to the yankees for a

3434
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:02,000
second

3435
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:03,599
you want to join the yankees but you

3436
01:56:02,000 --> 01:56:05,599
don't really want to work that hard you

3437
01:56:03,599 --> 01:56:07,039
don't really want to do batting practice

3438
01:56:05,599 --> 01:56:08,400
or pitching practice or whatever for

3439
01:56:07,039 --> 01:56:09,760
your position right

3440
01:56:08,399 --> 01:56:12,079
um

3441
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:13,679
that to me is wacko and that's actually

3442
01:56:12,079 --> 01:56:16,158
the world that it feels like we live in

3443
01:56:13,679 --> 01:56:17,599
in tech sometimes where people both want

3444
01:56:16,158 --> 01:56:19,439
to work for the yankees because it pays

3445
01:56:17,599 --> 01:56:21,039
a lot but like don't actually want to

3446
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:23,678
work that hard

3447
01:56:21,039 --> 01:56:25,920
that i don't fully understand because if

3448
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:27,520
you sign up for some of these things

3449
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:29,359
just sign up for it but it's okay if you

3450
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,599
don't want to sign up for it there's so

3451
01:56:29,359 --> 01:56:33,759
many wonderful careers in this world

3452
01:56:31,599 --> 01:56:34,960
that don't require 80 hours a week but

3453
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,560
when i read about companies going to

3454
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:39,039
like four day work weeks and stuff i

3455
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:41,119
just like i chuckle because i can't get

3456
01:56:39,039 --> 01:56:42,639
enough done with a seven day week i

3457
01:56:41,118 --> 01:56:44,079
don't know how

3458
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:46,000
and people will say oh you're just not

3459
01:56:44,079 --> 01:56:48,000
working smart and it's like no i i work

3460
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:49,439
pretty smart i think in general like i

3461
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:52,639
would have gotten to this point if i

3462
01:56:49,439 --> 01:56:54,319
hadn't like some amount of working smart

3463
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:56,239
and there is balance though so i used to

3464
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:58,158
be like a pretty big cyclist i don't do

3465
01:56:56,238 --> 01:57:01,598
it much anymore just because of kids and

3466
01:56:58,158 --> 01:57:02,960
like prioritizing other things right

3467
01:57:01,599 --> 01:57:06,000
but one of the most important things to

3468
01:57:02,960 --> 01:57:08,480
learn as a cyclist is to take a rest day

3469
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:11,520
but to me and to cyclists like resting

3470
01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:12,559
is a function of optimizing for the long

3471
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:14,480
run

3472
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,080
it's not like a thing that you do for

3473
01:57:14,479 --> 01:57:17,759
its own merits

3474
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:18,960
it's actually like if you don't rest

3475
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,320
your muscles don't recover and then

3476
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:21,760
you're just not as like you're not

3477
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:24,079
training as efficiently you should

3478
01:57:21,760 --> 01:57:25,840
probably the the successful people i've

3479
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:26,960
known in terms of athletes they hate

3480
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,319
rest days

3481
01:57:26,960 --> 01:57:30,079
but they know they have to do it for the

3482
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:32,000
long term like absolutely they think

3483
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:34,559
their opposition is getting stronger and

3484
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:36,238
stronger and that's the feeling but you

3485
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:38,320
know it's the right thing and usually

3486
01:57:36,238 --> 01:57:40,158
you need a coach to help you yeah

3487
01:57:38,319 --> 01:57:41,359
totally so i mean i use this thing

3488
01:57:40,158 --> 01:57:42,638
called training peaks and it's

3489
01:57:41,359 --> 01:57:44,719
interesting because it actually

3490
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:46,400
mathematically shows like where you are

3491
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:48,560
on the curve and all this stuff

3492
01:57:46,399 --> 01:57:50,879
yeah but you have to re like you have to

3493
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:52,719
have that rest but it it's a function of

3494
01:57:50,880 --> 01:57:55,199
going harder for longer again it's this

3495
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:57,118
reinforcement learning like planning the

3496
01:57:55,198 --> 01:57:59,039
aggregate and long but a lot of people

3497
01:57:57,118 --> 01:58:00,479
will hide behind laziness by saying that

3498
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:01,840
they're trying to optimize for the long

3499
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:03,919
run and they're not they're just not

3500
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:05,520
working very hard but again you don't

3501
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:07,440
have to sign up for it it's totally cool

3502
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:09,199
like i don't think less of people for

3503
01:58:07,439 --> 01:58:10,719
like not working super hard just like

3504
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:12,319
don't sign up for things that require

3505
01:58:10,719 --> 01:58:14,399
working super hard and some of that

3506
01:58:12,319 --> 01:58:16,399
requires for the leadership to have the

3507
01:58:14,399 --> 01:58:18,079
guts the boldness to communicate

3508
01:58:16,399 --> 01:58:19,439
effectively at the very beginning i mean

3509
01:58:18,079 --> 01:58:21,118
sometimes i think

3510
01:58:19,439 --> 01:58:22,158
most of the problems arise from the fact

3511
01:58:21,118 --> 01:58:24,559
that the

3512
01:58:22,158 --> 01:58:28,479
leadership is kind of hesitant

3513
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:30,480
to to communicate this the socially

3514
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:32,638
um difficult

3515
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:34,959
truth of what it takes to be

3516
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:36,719
at this company so they kind of

3517
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:38,960
say hey come come with us there's we

3518
01:58:36,719 --> 01:58:41,520
have snacks you know

3519
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:43,599
but unlimited vacation and yeah you know

3520
01:58:41,520 --> 01:58:45,679
uh ray at bridgewater is always

3521
01:58:43,599 --> 01:58:47,279
fascinating because you know people

3522
01:58:45,679 --> 01:58:49,599
it's been called like a cult on the

3523
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:51,439
outside or cultish and

3524
01:58:49,599 --> 01:58:52,880
but what's fascinating is like they just

3525
01:58:51,439 --> 01:58:54,559
don't give on their principles they're

3526
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:57,199
like listen this is what it's like to

3527
01:58:54,560 --> 01:58:59,039
work here we record every meeting

3528
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:00,158
we're like brutally honest

3529
01:58:59,039 --> 01:59:02,319
and that's not gonna feel right to

3530
01:59:00,158 --> 01:59:03,359
everyone and if it doesn't feel regular

3531
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:05,039
totally cool

3532
01:59:03,359 --> 01:59:07,920
just go work somewhere else but if you

3533
01:59:05,039 --> 01:59:10,319
work here you are signing up for this

3534
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:12,319
and that's that's been fascinating to me

3535
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:14,000
because it's honesty up front it's a

3536
01:59:12,319 --> 01:59:15,359
system in which you

3537
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:17,118
operate

3538
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:19,439
um and if it's not for you like no one's

3539
01:59:17,118 --> 01:59:21,198
forcing you to work there right

3540
01:59:19,439 --> 01:59:23,439
i i actually did so i i did a

3541
01:59:21,198 --> 01:59:25,039
conversation with him and uh

3542
01:59:23,439 --> 01:59:26,719
kind of got stuck in a funny moment

3543
01:59:25,039 --> 01:59:28,479
which is uh

3544
01:59:26,719 --> 01:59:30,239
at the end i asked him you know to give

3545
01:59:28,479 --> 01:59:31,279
me honest feedback of how i did on the

3546
01:59:30,238 --> 01:59:33,519
interview

3547
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:36,158
and um

3548
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:37,440
i don't think so he was super nice

3549
01:59:36,158 --> 01:59:39,439
he asked me

3550
01:59:37,439 --> 01:59:40,879
he's like well tell me did you

3551
01:59:39,439 --> 01:59:43,359
accomplish what you were hoping to

3552
01:59:40,880 --> 01:59:44,960
accomplish i was like that's not that's

3553
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:47,759
not

3554
01:59:44,960 --> 01:59:52,000
i'm asking you as an objective observer

3555
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:54,239
of two people talking how do we do today

3556
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,158
and then he's like well um he gave me

3557
01:59:54,238 --> 01:59:57,759
this politician answer well i feel like

3558
01:59:56,158 --> 02:00:00,719
we've accomplished successful

3559
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:02,239
communication of like ideas which is i'd

3560
02:00:00,719 --> 02:00:03,599
like i've loved to spread some of the

3561
02:00:02,238 --> 02:00:07,198
ideas

3562
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:09,360
in that like in principles and so on

3563
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:11,678
back to my original point it's really

3564
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:13,759
hard to get even for ray

3565
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:14,880
it's really hard to give feedback

3566
02:00:13,760 --> 02:00:16,480
and one of the other things i learned

3567
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:19,679
from him and and

3568
02:00:16,479 --> 02:00:22,238
just people in that world is like

3569
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:23,840
man humans really like to pretend like

3570
02:00:22,238 --> 02:00:24,638
they've come to

3571
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:26,159
uh

3572
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:27,440
that they've come to some kind of

3573
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:29,920
meeting of the minds like if there's

3574
02:00:27,439 --> 02:00:31,919
conflict if you and i have conflict

3575
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:34,399
it's always better to meet face to face

3576
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:36,399
right we're on the phone slack is not

3577
02:00:34,399 --> 02:00:38,238
great right email's not great but face

3578
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:40,960
to face what's crazy is you and i get

3579
02:00:38,238 --> 02:00:42,959
together and we actively try to even if

3580
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:44,800
we're not actually solving the conflict

3581
02:00:42,960 --> 02:00:47,359
we actively try to paper over the

3582
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:49,119
conflict oh yeah it didn't really bother

3583
02:00:47,359 --> 02:00:51,679
bothering me that much oh yeah i'm sure

3584
02:00:49,118 --> 02:00:53,839
you didn't mean it i'm sure but like

3585
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:55,599
no in our minds we're still there yeah

3586
02:00:53,840 --> 02:00:58,319
um so this is one of the things that as

3587
02:00:55,599 --> 02:01:00,000
a leader you always have to be digging

3588
02:00:58,319 --> 02:01:02,238
especially as you straight to the

3589
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,760
conflict yeah but as you ascend no one

3590
02:01:02,238 --> 02:01:06,559
wants to tell you you're crazy no one

3591
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:08,480
wants to tell you your idea is bad

3592
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:10,560
and you can you're like oh oh i'm going

3593
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:12,718
to be a leader and the idea is well i'm

3594
02:01:10,560 --> 02:01:13,520
just going to ask people no one tells

3595
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:16,560
you

3596
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:18,159
so like you have to look for the markers

3597
02:01:16,560 --> 02:01:20,320
knowing that literally just people

3598
02:01:18,158 --> 02:01:22,238
aren't going to tell you along the way

3599
02:01:20,319 --> 02:01:24,319
and be paranoid i mean you asked about

3600
02:01:22,238 --> 02:01:25,919
selling you know the company i think one

3601
02:01:24,319 --> 02:01:28,158
of the biggest differences between me

3602
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:29,760
and a lot of other entrepreneurs is like

3603
02:01:28,158 --> 02:01:32,158
i wasn't completely confident we could

3604
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:34,000
do it like we could be

3605
02:01:32,158 --> 02:01:36,319
alone and and

3606
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:37,760
and actually be great and if any

3607
02:01:36,319 --> 02:01:39,679
entrepreneur is honest with you they

3608
02:01:37,760 --> 02:01:41,440
also feel that way but a lot of people

3609
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:42,480
are like well i have to be cocky and

3610
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:44,238
just say

3611
02:01:42,479 --> 02:01:46,718
i can do this on my own we're going to

3612
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:48,559
be fine we're going to crush everyone

3613
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:50,639
some people do say that and then it's

3614
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:52,320
not right and they and they fail

3615
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:54,480
but um

3616
02:01:52,319 --> 02:01:56,799
being honest in that moment

3617
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:59,279
with yourself with the those close to

3618
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,440
you and also uh you talked about the

3619
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:04,238
personality of leaders and and who

3620
02:02:01,439 --> 02:02:06,719
resonates and who doesn't

3621
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:08,799
it's rare that i see

3622
02:02:06,719 --> 02:02:09,760
leaders be vulnerable

3623
02:02:08,800 --> 02:02:10,639
rare

3624
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:12,480
and

3625
02:02:10,639 --> 02:02:14,079
one thing i tried to do at instagram at

3626
02:02:12,479 --> 02:02:16,799
least internally

3627
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:18,719
was like say when i screwed up

3628
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:20,719
and like point out how i was wrong about

3629
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:22,560
things and point out where my judgment

3630
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:23,840
was off

3631
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,039
everyone thinks they have to bat a

3632
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,079
thousand

3633
02:02:25,039 --> 02:02:28,319
right like

3634
02:02:26,079 --> 02:02:29,800
that's crazy the best quant hedge funds

3635
02:02:28,319 --> 02:02:32,559
in the world bat

3636
02:02:29,800 --> 02:02:35,360
50.001 percent they just take a lot of

3637
02:02:32,560 --> 02:02:36,960
bets right renaissance

3638
02:02:35,359 --> 02:02:39,039
they might they might bat fifty one

3639
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:41,679
percent right but

3640
02:02:39,039 --> 02:02:43,519
holy hell like the question isn't are

3641
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:46,239
you right every single time and you have

3642
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:47,840
to seem invincible

3643
02:02:46,238 --> 02:02:50,158
the question is how many at-bats do you

3644
02:02:47,840 --> 02:02:52,719
get and on average are you are you

3645
02:02:50,158 --> 02:02:53,598
better on average

3646
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:55,599
right

3647
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:58,560
with enough bets and enough at bats that

3648
02:02:55,599 --> 02:03:00,800
your aggregate can be very high

3649
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:01,840
i mean steve jobs was wrong at a lot of

3650
02:03:00,800 --> 02:03:04,320
stuff

3651
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:05,520
the newton was too early right next not

3652
02:03:04,319 --> 02:03:07,840
quite right

3653
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:09,440
um there was even a time when he said

3654
02:03:07,840 --> 02:03:10,719
like no one will ever want to watch

3655
02:03:09,439 --> 02:03:13,279
video

3656
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:14,480
on the ipod

3657
02:03:13,279 --> 02:03:16,158
totally wrong

3658
02:03:14,479 --> 02:03:18,399
but who cares if you come around and

3659
02:03:16,158 --> 02:03:19,920
realize your mistake and fix it

3660
02:03:18,399 --> 02:03:21,679
it becomes just like you said harder and

3661
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:23,279
harder when your ego grows and the

3662
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:25,118
number of people around you that say

3663
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:27,279
positive things towards you

3664
02:03:25,118 --> 02:03:29,198
grows and i actually think it's really

3665
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:31,519
valuable that

3666
02:03:29,198 --> 02:03:33,919
like let's manage and a counter factual

3667
02:03:31,520 --> 02:03:36,239
where instagram became worth like 300

3668
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:37,118
billion or something crazy right

3669
02:03:36,238 --> 02:03:38,799
um

3670
02:03:37,118 --> 02:03:40,639
i kind of like that my life is

3671
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:42,000
relatively normal now when i say

3672
02:03:40,639 --> 02:03:44,079
relatively you get what i mean i'm not

3673
02:03:42,000 --> 02:03:45,679
making a claim that i live a normal life

3674
02:03:44,079 --> 02:03:48,479
but like i certainly don't live in a

3675
02:03:45,679 --> 02:03:50,639
world where there are like 15 sherpas

3676
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:52,638
following me like fetching me water or

3677
02:03:50,639 --> 02:03:54,639
whatever like that's not how it works i

3678
02:03:52,639 --> 02:03:56,960
actually like that i

3679
02:03:54,639 --> 02:03:58,880
have a sense of humility of like i may

3680
02:03:56,960 --> 02:04:01,039
not found another thing that's nearly as

3681
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:04,400
big so i have to work twice as hard

3682
02:04:01,039 --> 02:04:05,439
or i have to like learn twice as much i

3683
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:06,799
have to re

3684
02:04:05,439 --> 02:04:08,238
my we haven't talked about machine

3685
02:04:06,800 --> 02:04:11,119
learning yet but my favorite thing is

3686
02:04:08,238 --> 02:04:14,319
all these like famous

3687
02:04:11,118 --> 02:04:16,078
you know uh tech guys who have worked in

3688
02:04:14,319 --> 02:04:17,519
the industry pontificating about the

3689
02:04:16,078 --> 02:04:19,759
future of machine learning and how it's

3690
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:21,840
gonna kill us all and right like

3691
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:23,360
and like i'm pretty sure they've never

3692
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:25,599
tried to build anything with machine

3693
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:27,759
learning themselves yes

3694
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:29,119
so there's a nice line between people

3695
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:31,599
that actually built stuff with the

3696
02:04:29,118 --> 02:04:32,880
machine like actually program something

3697
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:35,199
or at least understand some of those

3698
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:36,800
fundamentals and the people they're just

3699
02:04:35,198 --> 02:04:39,519
saying philosophical stuff for

3700
02:04:36,800 --> 02:04:41,119
journalists and so on it's it's a it's

3701
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:42,719
an interesting line to walk because the

3702
02:04:41,118 --> 02:04:44,719
people who program

3703
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:46,158
are often not philosophers

3704
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:47,760
or don't have the attention they can't

3705
02:04:46,158 --> 02:04:49,359
write an op-ed for the wall street

3706
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:51,360
journal like it doesn't work so like

3707
02:04:49,359 --> 02:04:54,000
it's nice to be both a little bit like

3708
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:55,439
to have elements of both my point is the

3709
02:04:54,000 --> 02:04:58,000
fact that i have to learn stuff from

3710
02:04:55,439 --> 02:04:59,678
scratch or or that i choose to are like

3711
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:01,439
it's humbling uh

3712
02:04:59,679 --> 02:05:04,239
yeah i mean again

3713
02:05:01,439 --> 02:05:08,000
i have a lot of advantages i like

3714
02:05:04,238 --> 02:05:11,678
but my point is it's awesome to be

3715
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:14,238
back in a game where you have to fight

3716
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:16,399
that is that's fun so being humble being

3717
02:05:14,238 --> 02:05:18,158
vulnerable

3718
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:20,479
it's an important aspect of leader and i

3719
02:05:18,158 --> 02:05:22,238
hope it serves me well but like i can't

3720
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:23,919
fast forward 10 years to now i'm just

3721
02:05:22,238 --> 02:05:25,598
that's my game plan

3722
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:28,800
before i forget i have to ask you one

3723
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:29,599
last thing on instagram

3724
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:31,840
what do you think about the

3725
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:33,679
whistleblower francis

3726
02:05:31,840 --> 02:05:36,319
hogan recently coming out and saying

3727
02:05:33,679 --> 02:05:39,840
that facebook is aware for instagram's

3728
02:05:36,319 --> 02:05:42,158
harmful effect on teenage girls

3729
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:43,679
as per their own internal research

3730
02:05:42,158 --> 02:05:45,198
studies and the matter what do you think

3731
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:47,840
about this

3732
02:05:45,198 --> 02:05:50,158
baby of yours instagram being under fire

3733
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:53,760
now as we've been talking about

3734
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:53,759
under the leadership of facebook

3735
02:05:54,078 --> 02:05:59,439
you know i often question

3736
02:05:57,118 --> 02:06:02,639
where does the blame lie

3737
02:05:59,439 --> 02:06:05,118
is the blame at the people

3738
02:06:02,639 --> 02:06:06,239
that originated the network me

3739
02:06:05,118 --> 02:06:08,319
right

3740
02:06:06,238 --> 02:06:09,919
uh is the blame

3741
02:06:08,319 --> 02:06:11,679
at like the decision to combine the

3742
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:13,279
network with

3743
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:15,679
another network with a certain set of

3744
02:06:13,279 --> 02:06:17,118
values

3745
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:20,800
is the blame

3746
02:06:17,118 --> 02:06:22,960
at how it gets run after i left like is

3747
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:23,920
is it the driver or is it the car

3748
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:25,679
right

3749
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:27,760
um

3750
02:06:25,679 --> 02:06:30,000
is it that someone enabled these devices

3751
02:06:27,760 --> 02:06:31,679
in the first place if you go to an

3752
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:33,198
extreme right

3753
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:36,078
or is it the

3754
02:06:33,198 --> 02:06:37,919
users themselves just human nature is it

3755
02:06:36,078 --> 02:06:39,759
is it just the way of human nature sure

3756
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:41,520
and like the idea that we're gonna find

3757
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:43,360
a mutually exclusive answer here is

3758
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:45,520
crazy there's not one place it's a

3759
02:06:43,359 --> 02:06:47,118
combination of a lot of these things

3760
02:06:45,520 --> 02:06:49,280
and then the question is like is it true

3761
02:06:47,118 --> 02:06:52,158
at all right like i'm not actually

3762
02:06:49,279 --> 02:06:53,118
saying that's not true or that it's true

3763
02:06:52,158 --> 02:06:55,519
but

3764
02:06:53,118 --> 02:06:58,639
there's always more nuance here

3765
02:06:55,520 --> 02:07:00,800
do i believe that social media has an

3766
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:02,239
effect on young people well it's got it

3767
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:03,279
they use it a lot

3768
02:07:02,238 --> 02:07:04,879
and i bet you there are a lot of

3769
02:07:03,279 --> 02:07:06,238
positive effects and i bet you there are

3770
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:07,520
negative effects just like any

3771
02:07:06,238 --> 02:07:09,839
technology

3772
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:12,480
and where i've come to in my thinking on

3773
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:14,800
this is that i think any technology has

3774
02:07:12,479 --> 02:07:16,559
negative side effects the question is as

3775
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:18,239
a leader what do you do about them and

3776
02:07:16,560 --> 02:07:20,480
are you actively working on them or do

3777
02:07:18,238 --> 02:07:22,000
you just like not really believe in them

3778
02:07:20,479 --> 02:07:23,759
if you're a leader that sits there and

3779
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:26,238
says well we're going to put an enormous

3780
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:28,400
amount of resources against this we're

3781
02:07:26,238 --> 02:07:30,158
going to acknowledge when there are

3782
02:07:28,399 --> 02:07:32,399
true criticisms we're going to be

3783
02:07:30,158 --> 02:07:33,759
vulnerable that we're not perfect

3784
02:07:32,399 --> 02:07:35,359
and we're going to go fix them and we're

3785
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:37,119
going to be held accountable along the

3786
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:38,880
way

3787
02:07:37,118 --> 02:07:41,359
i think that people generally really

3788
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:43,599
respect that

3789
02:07:41,359 --> 02:07:45,279
but i think that where facebook i think

3790
02:07:43,599 --> 02:07:47,599
has had issues in the past is where they

3791
02:07:45,279 --> 02:07:49,599
say things like i can't remember what

3792
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:50,960
mark said about misinformation during

3793
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:52,480
the election there was that like famous

3794
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:54,158
quote where he's like

3795
02:07:52,479 --> 02:07:55,519
it's pretty crazy to think that facebook

3796
02:07:54,158 --> 02:07:56,960
had anything to do with this election

3797
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:58,480
like that was something like that quote

3798
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:00,158
and i don't remember what stage he was

3799
02:07:58,479 --> 02:08:04,078
on and yeah yeah

3800
02:08:00,158 --> 02:08:06,238
but ooh that did not age well right like

3801
02:08:04,078 --> 02:08:08,238
you have to be willing to say well maybe

3802
02:08:06,238 --> 02:08:10,799
there's there's there's something there

3803
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:12,879
and and wow like i want to go look into

3804
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:14,400
it and truly believe it in your gut but

3805
02:08:12,880 --> 02:08:16,719
if people look at you and how you act

3806
02:08:14,399 --> 02:08:18,559
and what you say and don't believe

3807
02:08:16,719 --> 02:08:19,920
you truly feel that way

3808
02:08:18,560 --> 02:08:21,760
it's not just the words you say about

3809
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:23,920
how you say them and that people believe

3810
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:25,920
that you actually feel the pain of

3811
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:28,078
having caused any suffering so to me

3812
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:29,199
it's um it's much more about your

3813
02:08:28,078 --> 02:08:31,840
actions

3814
02:08:29,198 --> 02:08:33,359
and your posture post event than it is

3815
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:35,440
about debugging the why because i don't

3816
02:08:33,359 --> 02:08:36,880
know is it

3817
02:08:35,439 --> 02:08:39,598
like i don't know this research it was

3818
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:41,920
written well after i left right like

3819
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:44,078
is it the algorithm is it the explorer

3820
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:46,880
page is it the people you might know

3821
02:08:44,078 --> 02:08:48,960
unit connecting you to you know ideas

3822
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:51,118
that are dangerous like i i really don't

3823
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:53,439
know yeah um

3824
02:08:51,118 --> 02:08:55,439
so we'd have to have a much deeper

3825
02:08:53,439 --> 02:08:57,839
i think dive to understand where the

3826
02:08:55,439 --> 02:08:59,678
blame lies what's very unpleasant to me

3827
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:02,719
to consider now i don't know if this is

3828
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:05,599
true but to consider the very fact that

3829
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:07,840
there might be some complicated games

3830
02:09:05,599 --> 02:09:10,719
being played here for example you know

3831
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:11,679
as somebody i really love psychology

3832
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:13,439
and

3833
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:15,520
i love it enough to know that the field

3834
02:09:13,439 --> 02:09:17,198
is pretty broken in the following way

3835
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:20,239
it's very difficult to study human

3836
02:09:17,198 --> 02:09:22,799
beings well at scale because the

3837
02:09:20,238 --> 02:09:24,319
questions you ask affect the results you

3838
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:26,239
can you can basically get any results

3839
02:09:24,319 --> 02:09:28,719
you want and so you have an internal

3840
02:09:26,238 --> 02:09:30,718
facebook study that asks some question

3841
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:32,399
of which we don't know the full details

3842
02:09:30,719 --> 02:09:34,239
there's some kind of analysis

3843
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:36,879
but that's just the one little tiny

3844
02:09:34,238 --> 02:09:38,879
slice into a some much bigger picture

3845
02:09:36,880 --> 02:09:41,039
and so you can have

3846
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:43,520
thousands of employees of facebook one

3847
02:09:41,039 --> 02:09:45,840
of them comes out and picks whatever

3848
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:47,840
narrative knowing that they become

3849
02:09:45,840 --> 02:09:50,239
famous coupled with the other really

3850
02:09:47,840 --> 02:09:53,039
uncomfortable thing i see in the world

3851
02:09:50,238 --> 02:09:55,678
which is journalists seem to understand

3852
02:09:53,039 --> 02:09:57,198
they get a lot of click-bait attention

3853
02:09:55,679 --> 02:09:59,920
from saying something negative about

3854
02:09:57,198 --> 02:10:01,678
social networks certain companies like

3855
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:03,599
they even get some

3856
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:06,000
some click-bait stuff

3857
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:08,078
about tesla or about

3858
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:11,359
especially when it's like when there's a

3859
02:10:08,078 --> 02:10:13,198
public famous ceo type of person if they

3860
02:10:11,359 --> 02:10:16,000
get a lot of views on the negative not

3861
02:10:13,198 --> 02:10:17,279
the positive the positive they'll get i

3862
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:19,359
mean it actually goes to the thing you

3863
02:10:17,279 --> 02:10:20,639
were saying before if there's a hot sexy

3864
02:10:19,359 --> 02:10:22,238
new product

3865
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:25,199
that's great to look forward to they get

3866
02:10:22,238 --> 02:10:26,959
positive on that but absent the product

3867
02:10:25,198 --> 02:10:29,279
it's nice to have

3868
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:31,118
uh like the ceo messing up with some

3869
02:10:29,279 --> 02:10:33,759
kind of way and so

3870
02:10:31,118 --> 02:10:34,719
couple that with the whistleblower and

3871
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:35,679
with the

3872
02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:37,760
uh

3873
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:40,399
this whole dynamic of journalism and so

3874
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:43,039
on you know uh with social dilemma being

3875
02:10:40,399 --> 02:10:44,559
a really popular documentary it's like

3876
02:10:43,039 --> 02:10:46,960
all right

3877
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:49,280
my concern is there's deep

3878
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:51,520
flaws in human nature here in terms of

3879
02:10:49,279 --> 02:10:54,399
things we need to deal with like the

3880
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:56,800
nature of hate yeah of bullying all

3881
02:10:54,399 --> 02:10:59,920
those kinds of things and then there's

3882
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:02,000
people who are trying to use that

3883
02:10:59,920 --> 02:11:04,078
potentially to become famous and make

3884
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:06,238
money off of

3885
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:07,759
off of blaming others for causing more

3886
02:11:06,238 --> 02:11:09,359
of the problem as opposed to helping

3887
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:11,840
solve the problem so i don't know what

3888
02:11:09,359 --> 02:11:14,078
to think i'm not saying this is like i'm

3889
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:16,639
just uncomfortable with i guess not

3890
02:11:14,078 --> 02:11:17,920
knowing what to think about any of this

3891
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:19,520
because a bunch of folks i know that

3892
02:11:17,920 --> 02:11:20,880
work at facebook

3893
02:11:19,520 --> 02:11:23,599
on the machine learning side so young

3894
02:11:20,880 --> 02:11:25,599
lacoon i mean they they're quite upset

3895
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:27,360
by what's happening because there's a

3896
02:11:25,599 --> 02:11:30,000
lot of really brilliant good people

3897
02:11:27,359 --> 02:11:32,078
inside facebook they're trying to yeah

3898
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:34,158
do good and so like all of us impressed

3899
02:11:32,078 --> 02:11:35,679
jan is one of them and he has an amazing

3900
02:11:34,158 --> 02:11:36,479
team of the machine learning researchers

3901
02:11:35,679 --> 02:11:38,480
like

3902
02:11:36,479 --> 02:11:40,399
he's really upset with the fact that

3903
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:42,479
people don't seem to understand

3904
02:11:40,399 --> 02:11:44,719
that this this is not the portrayal does

3905
02:11:42,479 --> 02:11:46,718
not represent the the full nature of

3906
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:48,480
efforts that's going on facebook so i

3907
02:11:46,719 --> 02:11:50,158
don't know what to think about that well

3908
02:11:48,479 --> 02:11:53,279
you just i think

3909
02:11:50,158 --> 02:11:54,879
very helpfully explained the nuance of

3910
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:56,078
the situation and why it's so hard to

3911
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:59,760
understand

3912
02:11:56,078 --> 02:11:59,759
but a couple things one is um

3913
02:12:00,800 --> 02:12:08,480
i think i i have been surprised at

3914
02:12:04,840 --> 02:12:09,840
the scale with which

3915
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:11,839
some

3916
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:14,560
product manager

3917
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:17,199
can do an enormous amount of harm to a

3918
02:12:14,560 --> 02:12:19,520
very very large company

3919
02:12:17,198 --> 02:12:21,039
by releasing a trove of documents like i

3920
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:22,719
i think i read a couple of them when

3921
02:12:21,039 --> 02:12:24,800
they got published i haven't even spent

3922
02:12:22,719 --> 02:12:26,480
any time going deep part of it's like i

3923
02:12:24,800 --> 02:12:29,679
don't really feel like reliving a

3924
02:12:26,479 --> 02:12:30,718
previous life but um

3925
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:32,239
wow

3926
02:12:30,719 --> 02:12:34,399
like talk about

3927
02:12:32,238 --> 02:12:36,399
challenging the idea of open culture and

3928
02:12:34,399 --> 02:12:38,638
like what that does to facebook

3929
02:12:36,399 --> 02:12:40,638
internally if facebook was built like i

3930
02:12:38,639 --> 02:12:42,400
remember um

3931
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:43,279
like my office

3932
02:12:42,399 --> 02:12:45,039
uh

3933
02:12:43,279 --> 02:12:46,319
we had this like no visitors rule around

3934
02:12:45,039 --> 02:12:48,960
my office because we always had like

3935
02:12:46,319 --> 02:12:50,559
confidential stuff up on the walls and

3936
02:12:48,960 --> 02:12:52,078
never was super angry because they're

3937
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:54,239
like that goes against our culture of

3938
02:12:52,078 --> 02:12:55,599
transparency and like mark's in the fish

3939
02:12:54,238 --> 02:12:57,919
cube or whatever they call it the

3940
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:59,440
aquarium i think they called it um where

3941
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:01,359
like literally anyone could see what he

3942
02:12:59,439 --> 02:13:02,479
was doing at any point and

3943
02:13:01,359 --> 02:13:04,078
um

3944
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:05,519
and i don't know i mean other companies

3945
02:13:04,078 --> 02:13:08,319
like apple have been

3946
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:09,280
quiet slash lockdown snapchats the same

3947
02:13:08,319 --> 02:13:12,399
way for

3948
02:13:09,279 --> 02:13:13,439
a reason and

3949
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:15,359
i don't know what this does to

3950
02:13:13,439 --> 02:13:17,919
transparency on the inside of startups

3951
02:13:15,359 --> 02:13:19,359
that value that i think that it's a

3952
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:20,960
seminal moment

3953
02:13:19,359 --> 02:13:23,118
and you can say well you should have

3954
02:13:20,960 --> 02:13:25,279
nothing to hide right but to your point

3955
02:13:23,118 --> 02:13:26,880
you can pick out documents that show

3956
02:13:25,279 --> 02:13:28,960
anything right

3957
02:13:26,880 --> 02:13:30,800
um but i don't know so

3958
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:32,880
what happens to transparency inside of

3959
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:33,920
startups and the culture that

3960
02:13:32,880 --> 02:13:35,520
will have

3961
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:37,520
that that startups or companies in the

3962
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:39,040
future will grow like the startup of the

3963
02:13:37,520 --> 02:13:40,880
future that becomes the next facebook

3964
02:13:39,039 --> 02:13:41,840
will be locked down and what does that

3965
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:46,239
do

3966
02:13:41,840 --> 02:13:48,000
right so that's part one part two

3967
02:13:46,238 --> 02:13:49,359
like i i don't think that you could

3968
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:50,800
design

3969
02:13:49,359 --> 02:13:52,598
a more like

3970
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:54,400
uh uh

3971
02:13:52,599 --> 02:13:56,400
well-orchestrated

3972
02:13:54,399 --> 02:13:58,799
handful of events from the like 16

3973
02:13:56,399 --> 02:14:01,039
minutes to

3974
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:02,320
um releasing the documents in the way

3975
02:14:01,039 --> 02:14:04,238
that they were released at the right

3976
02:14:02,319 --> 02:14:05,679
time

3977
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:07,439
that takes a lot of planning and

3978
02:14:05,679 --> 02:14:10,960
partnership and it seems like she has a

3979
02:14:07,439 --> 02:14:13,039
partner at some firm right that probably

3980
02:14:10,960 --> 02:14:16,158
uh helped a lot with this but

3981
02:14:13,039 --> 02:14:19,439
man as at a personal level if you're her

3982
02:14:16,158 --> 02:14:20,879
you'd have to really believe in what you

3983
02:14:19,439 --> 02:14:22,879
are doing

3984
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:24,719
really believe in it because you are

3985
02:14:22,880 --> 02:14:27,199
personally putting your ass on the line

3986
02:14:24,719 --> 02:14:28,960
right like you've got a

3987
02:14:27,198 --> 02:14:33,519
very large company

3988
02:14:28,960 --> 02:14:35,439
that that doesn't like enemies right um

3989
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:37,119
it takes a lot of guts

3990
02:14:35,439 --> 02:14:39,198
uh and

3991
02:14:37,118 --> 02:14:40,880
i don't love these conspiracy theories

3992
02:14:39,198 --> 02:14:42,960
about like oh she's being financed from

3993
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:44,480
some person or people like i don't love

3994
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:45,520
them because that's like the easy thing

3995
02:14:44,479 --> 02:14:48,158
to say

3996
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:49,679
i think the the the occam's razor here

3997
02:14:48,158 --> 02:14:51,118
is like someone thought they were doing

3998
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:55,920
something wrong

3999
02:14:51,118 --> 02:14:57,359
and was like very very courageous in in

4000
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:59,359
i don't know if courageous is the word

4001
02:14:57,359 --> 02:15:01,118
but like so

4002
02:14:59,359 --> 02:15:03,039
without getting into like is she a

4003
02:15:01,118 --> 02:15:04,880
martyr is she courageous is she right

4004
02:15:03,039 --> 02:15:05,760
like let's put that aside for a second

4005
02:15:04,880 --> 02:15:07,279
yeah

4006
02:15:05,760 --> 02:15:09,440
then there are the documents themselves

4007
02:15:07,279 --> 02:15:10,800
they say what they say

4008
02:15:09,439 --> 02:15:12,238
to your point

4009
02:15:10,800 --> 02:15:13,920
a lot of the things that like people

4010
02:15:12,238 --> 02:15:15,678
have been worried about

4011
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:18,158
already in the documents are or they're

4012
02:15:15,679 --> 02:15:19,359
already been said externally and

4013
02:15:18,158 --> 02:15:21,759
um

4014
02:15:19,359 --> 02:15:23,519
i don't know i'm just like i'm i'm

4015
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:25,679
thankful that i am focused on new things

4016
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:27,440
with my life

4017
02:15:25,679 --> 02:15:29,679
well let me just say i just think it's a

4018
02:15:27,439 --> 02:15:32,158
really hard problem that probably

4019
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:34,000
facebook and twitter are trying to solve

4020
02:15:32,158 --> 02:15:36,319
i'm actually just fascinated by how hard

4021
02:15:34,000 --> 02:15:39,039
this problem is there are fundamental

4022
02:15:36,319 --> 02:15:41,679
issues at facebook in tone and in an

4023
02:15:39,039 --> 02:15:43,760
approach of how product gets built and

4024
02:15:41,679 --> 02:15:44,719
the objective functions and

4025
02:15:43,760 --> 02:15:47,119
um

4026
02:15:44,719 --> 02:15:50,319
and since people uh uh organizations are

4027
02:15:47,118 --> 02:15:51,598
not people so yawn and fair right like

4028
02:15:50,319 --> 02:15:53,198
there are a lot of really great people

4029
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:55,279
who like literally just want to push

4030
02:15:53,198 --> 02:15:57,439
reinforcement learning forward they

4031
02:15:55,279 --> 02:16:00,238
literally just want to teach a robot to

4032
02:15:57,439 --> 02:16:02,000
touch feel lift right like

4033
02:16:00,238 --> 02:16:04,479
they're not thinking about political

4034
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:06,960
misinformation right yeah but there's a

4035
02:16:04,479 --> 02:16:09,279
there's a strong connection between what

4036
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:11,439
funds that research and an enormously

4037
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:14,158
profitable machine

4038
02:16:11,439 --> 02:16:16,799
uh that has trade-offs and

4039
02:16:14,158 --> 02:16:18,638
uh one cannot

4040
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:21,360
one cannot separate the two you are not

4041
02:16:18,639 --> 02:16:22,560
completely separate from the system

4042
02:16:21,359 --> 02:16:24,399
so

4043
02:16:22,560 --> 02:16:26,639
i agree it can feel really frustrating

4044
02:16:24,399 --> 02:16:28,158
to feel if you're internally internal

4045
02:16:26,639 --> 02:16:30,078
there that you're working on something

4046
02:16:28,158 --> 02:16:32,638
completely unrelated and you feel like

4047
02:16:30,078 --> 02:16:34,318
your group's good i can understand that

4048
02:16:32,638 --> 02:16:35,438
but there's some responsibility still

4049
02:16:34,318 --> 02:16:37,039
you have to acknowledge it's like the

4050
02:16:35,439 --> 02:16:38,880
ray dalio thing you have to look in the

4051
02:16:37,040 --> 02:16:42,000
mirror and see if there's problems and

4052
02:16:38,879 --> 02:16:42,000
you have to fix those problems

4053
02:16:43,519 --> 02:16:47,439
you mentioned machine learning

4054
02:16:44,638 --> 02:16:49,199
reinforcement quite a bit i mean to me

4055
02:16:47,439 --> 02:16:50,159
social networks is one of the exciting

4056
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:51,679
places

4057
02:16:50,159 --> 02:16:53,519
recommender systems where machine

4058
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:55,040
learning is applied where else in the

4059
02:16:53,519 --> 02:16:56,800
world

4060
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:58,800
in space of possibilities over the next

4061
02:16:56,799 --> 02:17:02,239
5 10 20 years do you think we're going

4062
02:16:58,799 --> 02:17:04,799
to see impact of machine learning

4063
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:07,119
when you try on the philosophical level

4064
02:17:04,799 --> 02:17:11,119
on a technical level what do you think

4065
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:11,120
or or within social networks themselves

4066
02:17:11,519 --> 02:17:17,679
well i think the obvious answers are

4067
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:19,679
climate change right like think about

4068
02:17:17,679 --> 02:17:22,318
how much fuel

4069
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:23,840
or or just waste there is in energy

4070
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:25,279
consumption

4071
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:28,398
today because

4072
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:30,880
we don't plan accordingly because we

4073
02:17:28,398 --> 02:17:32,638
take the least efficient route or the

4074
02:17:30,879 --> 02:17:34,718
logistics and stuff the supply chain all

4075
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:36,239
that kind of stuff yeah i mean

4076
02:17:34,718 --> 02:17:37,279
listen if we're going to fight climate

4077
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:38,558
change like

4078
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:40,399
one really way

4079
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:42,478
one awesome way to do it is figure out

4080
02:17:40,398 --> 02:17:44,239
how to optimize how we operate as a

4081
02:17:42,478 --> 02:17:46,558
species and

4082
02:17:44,239 --> 02:17:49,199
and minimize the amount of energy we

4083
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:50,879
consume to maximize whatever economic

4084
02:17:49,200 --> 02:17:52,399
impact we want to have

4085
02:17:50,879 --> 02:17:54,799
because right now those two are very

4086
02:17:52,398 --> 02:17:56,398
much tied together and

4087
02:17:54,799 --> 02:17:58,000
i don't believe that has to be the case

4088
02:17:56,398 --> 02:17:59,840
there's this really interesting you've

4089
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:01,040
read it um

4090
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:02,719
for people who are listening there's

4091
02:18:01,040 --> 02:18:04,559
this really interesting paper on

4092
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:06,239
reinforcement learning and energy

4093
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:08,239
consumption inside buildings it's like

4094
02:18:06,239 --> 02:18:10,318
one of the seminal ones right um but

4095
02:18:08,239 --> 02:18:13,199
imagine that at massive scale that's

4096
02:18:10,318 --> 02:18:15,519
super interesting i mean they've done

4097
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:17,760
like resource planning for servers for

4098
02:18:15,519 --> 02:18:18,880
peak load using reinforcement learning i

4099
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:20,880
don't know if that was at google or

4100
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:22,398
somewhere else but like okay great you

4101
02:18:20,879 --> 02:18:24,398
do it for servers but what if you could

4102
02:18:22,398 --> 02:18:26,718
do it for just capacity and general

4103
02:18:24,398 --> 02:18:28,478
energy capacity for cities and planning

4104
02:18:26,718 --> 02:18:32,159
for traffic and of course there's all

4105
02:18:28,478 --> 02:18:33,199
the um self-driving cars and

4106
02:18:32,159 --> 02:18:37,599
i don't know like i'm not going to

4107
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:39,599
pontificate like crazy ideas

4108
02:18:37,599 --> 02:18:41,280
using reinforcement learning or machine

4109
02:18:39,599 --> 02:18:43,760
learning it's just so clear to me that

4110
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:45,280
humans don't think quickly enough so

4111
02:18:43,760 --> 02:18:46,478
it's interesting to think about machine

4112
02:18:45,280 --> 02:18:48,880
learning

4113
02:18:46,478 --> 02:18:51,119
helping a little bit

4114
02:18:48,879 --> 02:18:53,279
at scale so a little bit to a large

4115
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:55,359
number of people that has a huge impact

4116
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:57,120
so if you optimize

4117
02:18:55,359 --> 02:18:59,200
say google maps something like that

4118
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:00,479
trajectory planning or would it map

4119
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:02,639
quest first

4120
02:19:00,478 --> 02:19:04,159
uh yeah getting here i looked and it was

4121
02:19:02,638 --> 02:19:05,679
like here's the most energy efficient

4122
02:19:04,159 --> 02:19:07,280
route i was like i'm gonna be late i

4123
02:19:05,679 --> 02:19:10,478
need to take the fastest route as

4124
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:12,319
opposed to unrolling the map yeah yeah

4125
02:19:10,478 --> 02:19:13,438
like and that's going to be very

4126
02:19:12,318 --> 02:19:15,279
inefficient no matter what i was

4127
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:18,479
definitely the other day like part of

4128
02:19:15,280 --> 02:19:21,200
the epsilon of epsilon greedy with waze

4129
02:19:18,478 --> 02:19:22,959
where like i was sent on like a weird

4130
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:25,519
route that i could tell they're like we

4131
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:27,919
just need to collect data of this road

4132
02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:29,679
like we just kevin's the ant they sent

4133
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:32,239
out kevin's definitely gonna be the

4134
02:19:29,679 --> 02:19:34,799
guinea pig and great now we have did you

4135
02:19:32,239 --> 02:19:36,398
at least feel pride oh going through it

4136
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:38,318
i was like oh this is fun like now they

4137
02:19:36,398 --> 02:19:39,679
get data about this weird shortcut and

4138
02:19:38,318 --> 02:19:42,000
actually i hit all the green lights and

4139
02:19:39,679 --> 02:19:43,760
it worked and i'm like this is a problem

4140
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:46,159
data bad data they're just going to

4141
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:47,679
imagine i could see you slowing down and

4142
02:19:46,159 --> 02:19:49,680
stopping in a green light just to give

4143
02:19:47,679 --> 02:19:51,120
them the right kind of data yeah

4144
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:53,280
um but to answer your question like i

4145
02:19:51,120 --> 02:19:55,600
feel like that was fairly unsatisfying

4146
02:19:53,280 --> 02:19:57,680
and it's easy to say climate change but

4147
02:19:55,600 --> 02:19:59,600
what i would say is

4148
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:02,639
at instagram everything we applied

4149
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:04,318
machining learning to uh got better for

4150
02:20:02,639 --> 02:20:06,719
users and it got better better for the

4151
02:20:04,318 --> 02:20:08,239
company i saw the power i didn't fully

4152
02:20:06,719 --> 02:20:10,478
understand it as an executive and i

4153
02:20:08,239 --> 02:20:11,760
think that's actually one of the issues

4154
02:20:10,478 --> 02:20:13,119
that uh

4155
02:20:11,760 --> 02:20:14,800
and when i say understand i mean the

4156
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:16,880
mathematics of it like i understand what

4157
02:20:14,799 --> 02:20:20,079
it does i understand that it helps

4158
02:20:16,879 --> 02:20:20,959
but um there are a lot of executives now

4159
02:20:20,079 --> 02:20:22,559
that

4160
02:20:20,959 --> 02:20:24,159
talk about it and the way that they talk

4161
02:20:22,559 --> 02:20:25,600
about the internet or they talked about

4162
02:20:24,159 --> 02:20:27,119
the internet like 10 years ago they're

4163
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:28,079
like we're gonna build mobile and you're

4164
02:20:27,120 --> 02:20:29,439
like what does that mean they're like

4165
02:20:28,079 --> 02:20:30,719
we're just gonna do mobile and you're

4166
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:33,280
like okay

4167
02:20:30,719 --> 02:20:35,519
um so my sense is the next generation of

4168
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:36,960
leaders will have grown up having had

4169
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:38,720
classes

4170
02:20:36,959 --> 02:20:40,079
in reinforcement learning supervised

4171
02:20:38,719 --> 02:20:42,318
learning whatever

4172
02:20:40,079 --> 02:20:43,600
and they will be able to thoughtfully

4173
02:20:42,318 --> 02:20:46,159
apply it to their companies and the

4174
02:20:43,600 --> 02:20:48,000
places it it is needed most

4175
02:20:46,159 --> 02:20:51,280
and that's really cool because i mean

4176
02:20:48,000 --> 02:20:52,639
talk about efficiency gains

4177
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:54,159
i it's

4178
02:20:52,639 --> 02:20:55,840
that that's what excites me the most

4179
02:20:54,159 --> 02:20:58,000
about it yeah so there's it's

4180
02:20:55,840 --> 02:20:59,439
interesting just to get a fundamental

4181
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,760
first principles understanding of

4182
02:20:59,439 --> 02:21:03,760
certain concepts of machine learning so

4183
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:05,920
supervised learning from an executive

4184
02:21:03,760 --> 02:21:07,600
perspective supervised learning you have

4185
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:10,000
to have a lot of humans label a lot of

4186
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:11,200
data so the question there is okay can

4187
02:21:10,000 --> 02:21:12,719
we gather

4188
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:14,240
a large amount of data that can be

4189
02:21:12,719 --> 02:21:16,079
labeled well

4190
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:18,879
and that's the question tesla asks like

4191
02:21:16,079 --> 02:21:20,079
can we create a data engine that keeps

4192
02:21:18,879 --> 02:21:21,599
um

4193
02:21:20,079 --> 02:21:23,840
sending an imperfect machine learning

4194
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:26,239
system out there whenever it fails it

4195
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:27,920
gives us data back we label it by human

4196
02:21:26,239 --> 02:21:30,000
and we send it back and forth so this

4197
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:31,520
way then there is uh yamaha coons

4198
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,520
excited about this self-supervised

4199
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:36,159
learning where

4200
02:21:33,520 --> 02:21:38,399
you do much less human labeling and

4201
02:21:36,159 --> 02:21:41,039
there's some kind of mechanism for the

4202
02:21:38,398 --> 02:21:43,039
system to learn it by itself on the on

4203
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:44,880
the human generated data and then

4204
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:46,399
there's the reinforcement learning which

4205
02:21:44,879 --> 02:21:48,719
is like

4206
02:21:46,398 --> 02:21:52,799
basically allowing it's it's applying

4207
02:21:48,719 --> 02:21:54,398
the alpha zero uh technology that uh

4208
02:21:52,799 --> 02:21:57,199
allowed through self-play

4209
02:21:54,398 --> 02:21:58,000
to learn how to solve the game of go and

4210
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:00,479
and

4211
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:02,239
achieve incredible levels at the game of

4212
02:22:00,478 --> 02:22:04,239
chess

4213
02:22:02,239 --> 02:22:06,079
it can you formulate the problem you're

4214
02:22:04,239 --> 02:22:08,079
trying to solve in a way that's amenable

4215
02:22:06,079 --> 02:22:09,760
to reinforcement learning and can you

4216
02:22:08,079 --> 02:22:11,760
get the right kind of signal at scale

4217
02:22:09,760 --> 02:22:13,280
because you need a lot a lot of signal

4218
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:15,600
and that that's that's kind of

4219
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:17,760
fascinating to see which part of a

4220
02:22:15,600 --> 02:22:19,520
social network can you convert into a

4221
02:22:17,760 --> 02:22:21,439
reinforcement learning problem the

4222
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:23,520
fascinating thing about reinforcement

4223
02:22:21,439 --> 02:22:27,040
learning i think

4224
02:22:23,520 --> 02:22:30,000
is that we now have learned to apply

4225
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:31,280
uh neural networks to guess

4226
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,159
uh

4227
02:22:31,280 --> 02:22:36,399
you know q func like the q function

4228
02:22:34,159 --> 02:22:37,840
basically the values for any state in

4229
02:22:36,398 --> 02:22:39,519
action

4230
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:41,200
and that is fascinating because we used

4231
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:42,720
to just like i don't know have like a

4232
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:45,200
linear regression like hope it worked

4233
02:22:42,719 --> 02:22:46,639
and that was the fanciest version of it

4234
02:22:45,200 --> 02:22:48,079
but now you look at it i'm like trying

4235
02:22:46,639 --> 02:22:50,159
to learn this stuff and i look at it i'm

4236
02:22:48,079 --> 02:22:52,000
like there are like 17 different

4237
02:22:50,159 --> 02:22:54,719
acronyms of different ways you can try

4238
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:56,559
to apply this no one quite agrees like

4239
02:22:54,719 --> 02:22:58,719
what's the best generally if you're

4240
02:22:56,559 --> 02:23:00,639
trying to like build a neural network

4241
02:22:58,719 --> 02:23:01,920
they're pretty well-trodden ways of

4242
02:23:00,639 --> 02:23:05,279
doing that

4243
02:23:01,920 --> 02:23:07,359
you use atom you use relu you use like

4244
02:23:05,280 --> 02:23:09,200
there's just like general good ideas and

4245
02:23:07,359 --> 02:23:13,520
in in reinforcement learning i feel like

4246
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:15,520
the consensus is like it totally depends

4247
02:23:13,520 --> 02:23:17,760
and by the way it's really hard to get

4248
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:18,560
it to converge and it's noisy and it

4249
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:19,680
like

4250
02:23:18,559 --> 02:23:21,199
so there are all these really

4251
02:23:19,680 --> 02:23:23,439
interesting ideas around building

4252
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:24,560
simulators um

4253
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:26,800
you know like for instance in

4254
02:23:24,559 --> 02:23:29,119
self-driving right like you

4255
02:23:26,799 --> 02:23:30,879
don't want to like actually have someone

4256
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:33,359
get in an accident to learn that an

4257
02:23:30,879 --> 02:23:35,199
accident is bad so you start simulating

4258
02:23:33,359 --> 02:23:36,880
accidents simulating aggressive drivers

4259
02:23:35,200 --> 02:23:39,040
they're simulating crazy dogs that run

4260
02:23:36,879 --> 02:23:42,000
into the street and

4261
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:43,439
wow fascinating right like that my mind

4262
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:45,760
starts racing and then the question is

4263
02:23:43,439 --> 02:23:49,200
okay forget about uh self-driving cars

4264
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:51,680
let's talk about uh social networks

4265
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:54,159
um how can you produce a better more

4266
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:56,559
thoughtful experience using these types

4267
02:23:54,159 --> 02:23:57,840
of of algorithms and

4268
02:23:56,559 --> 02:24:00,079
honestly in talking to some of the

4269
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:01,520
people that work at facebook and and old

4270
02:24:00,079 --> 02:24:03,520
instagramers

4271
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:05,359
most people are like yeah we tried a lot

4272
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:07,280
of things didn't quite ever make it work

4273
02:24:05,359 --> 02:24:09,680
i mean for the longest time facebook ads

4274
02:24:07,280 --> 02:24:11,760
was effectively a logistic regression

4275
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:13,120
okay i don't know what it is now but

4276
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:14,159
like if you look at this paper they

4277
02:24:13,120 --> 02:24:15,920
published back in the day it was

4278
02:24:14,159 --> 02:24:18,879
literally just a logistic regression

4279
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:21,280
made a lot of money um

4280
02:24:18,879 --> 02:24:23,358
so even at these like extremely large

4281
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:25,439
scales if we are not yet touching what

4282
02:24:23,359 --> 02:24:26,880
reinforcement learning can truly do

4283
02:24:25,439 --> 02:24:29,520
imagine what the next 10 years looks

4284
02:24:26,879 --> 02:24:31,199
like yeah how cool is that it's amazing

4285
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:32,640
so i really like the use of

4286
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:34,720
reinforcement learning as part of the

4287
02:24:32,639 --> 02:24:36,398
simulation for example

4288
02:24:34,719 --> 02:24:38,478
like with self-driving cars it's

4289
02:24:36,398 --> 02:24:40,318
modeling pedestrians so the nice thing

4290
02:24:38,478 --> 02:24:42,559
about reinforcement learning

4291
02:24:40,318 --> 02:24:44,879
it can be used to

4292
02:24:42,559 --> 02:24:46,959
learn agents within the world

4293
02:24:44,879 --> 02:24:49,199
so they can learn to behave properly

4294
02:24:46,959 --> 02:24:50,719
like you can teach pedestrians to

4295
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:53,439
like you don't hard code the way they

4296
02:24:50,719 --> 02:24:55,679
behave they learn how to behave in that

4297
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:58,159
same way i do have a hope was it jack

4298
02:24:55,680 --> 02:25:00,398
dorsey talks about healthy conversations

4299
02:24:58,159 --> 02:25:03,439
you talked about uh meaningful

4300
02:25:00,398 --> 02:25:04,478
interactions i believe yeah

4301
02:25:03,439 --> 02:25:06,800
like

4302
02:25:04,478 --> 02:25:08,799
simulating interactions

4303
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:10,959
so you can learn how to manage that it's

4304
02:25:08,799 --> 02:25:13,358
fascinating so where most of your

4305
02:25:10,959 --> 02:25:14,879
algorithm development happens on in

4306
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:16,960
virtual worlds

4307
02:25:14,879 --> 02:25:19,279
and then you can really learn how to

4308
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:21,358
design the interface how you design much

4309
02:25:19,280 --> 02:25:23,600
of aspects of the experience

4310
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:24,960
in terms of the how you select what's

4311
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:26,000
shown in the feed all those kinds of

4312
02:25:24,959 --> 02:25:27,519
things that

4313
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:28,879
it feels like if you can connect

4314
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:31,680
reinforce some learning to that that's

4315
02:25:28,879 --> 02:25:33,519
super exciting yep and uh

4316
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:35,439
i think if you have if you have a

4317
02:25:33,520 --> 02:25:36,960
company and leadership that believe in

4318
02:25:35,439 --> 02:25:39,040
doing the right things and can apply

4319
02:25:36,959 --> 02:25:41,279
this technology in the right way some

4320
02:25:39,040 --> 02:25:42,800
really special stuff can happen

4321
02:25:41,280 --> 02:25:44,319
it is mostly like

4322
02:25:42,799 --> 02:25:46,159
likely going to be a group of people

4323
02:25:44,318 --> 02:25:47,359
we've never heard about startup from

4324
02:25:46,159 --> 02:25:49,280
scratch

4325
02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:50,960
right um

4326
02:25:49,280 --> 02:25:52,720
and and you asked if like new social

4327
02:25:50,959 --> 02:25:55,679
networks could be built i

4328
02:25:52,719 --> 02:25:57,599
i've got to imagine they will be and

4329
02:25:55,680 --> 02:25:59,760
whoever starts it it might be some kids

4330
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:02,079
in a garage that took these classes from

4331
02:25:59,760 --> 02:26:03,600
these people you right like

4332
02:26:02,079 --> 02:26:04,959
and they're building

4333
02:26:03,600 --> 02:26:07,280
all of these things with this tech at

4334
02:26:04,959 --> 02:26:09,759
the core so i'm trying not to be someone

4335
02:26:07,280 --> 02:26:12,000
who just like throws around

4336
02:26:09,760 --> 02:26:14,239
reinforcement learning as a buzzword i

4337
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,079
truly believe that it is

4338
02:26:14,239 --> 02:26:18,159
the most cutting edge

4339
02:26:16,079 --> 02:26:20,639
in what can happen in social networks

4340
02:26:18,159 --> 02:26:22,318
and i also believe it's super hard

4341
02:26:20,639 --> 02:26:24,000
like it's super hard to make it work

4342
02:26:22,318 --> 02:26:25,519
it's super hard to do it at scale it's

4343
02:26:24,000 --> 02:26:26,719
super hard to find people that truly

4344
02:26:25,520 --> 02:26:29,920
understand it

4345
02:26:26,719 --> 02:26:31,199
so i'm not gonna say that like

4346
02:26:29,920 --> 02:26:32,478
i think it'll be applied in social

4347
02:26:31,200 --> 02:26:33,680
networks before we have true

4348
02:26:32,478 --> 02:26:34,478
self-driving

4349
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:35,760
yeah

4350
02:26:34,478 --> 02:26:37,279
let me put it that way we could argue

4351
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:38,960
about this for a long time but yes i

4352
02:26:37,280 --> 02:26:40,560
agree with you so i think self-driving

4353
02:26:38,959 --> 02:26:42,959
is way harder than people realize oh

4354
02:26:40,559 --> 02:26:44,478
absolutely uh let me ask you in terms of

4355
02:26:42,959 --> 02:26:46,159
that kid in the garage or those couple

4356
02:26:44,478 --> 02:26:47,760
of kids in the garage what advice would

4357
02:26:46,159 --> 02:26:49,840
you give to them if they want to start a

4358
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:51,840
new social network or

4359
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:54,000
a business what advice would you give to

4360
02:26:51,840 --> 02:26:56,398
somebody with a big dream and a young

4361
02:26:54,000 --> 02:26:56,398
startup

4362
02:26:56,799 --> 02:27:02,398
to me you have to choose to do something

4363
02:26:59,359 --> 02:27:05,040
that even if it fails like you you it

4364
02:27:02,398 --> 02:27:06,639
was so fun right like

4365
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:08,560
we never started instagram knowing it

4366
02:27:06,639 --> 02:27:11,199
was going to be big we started instagram

4367
02:27:08,559 --> 02:27:13,359
because we loved photography we loved

4368
02:27:11,200 --> 02:27:14,880
social networks i had seen what other

4369
02:27:13,359 --> 02:27:18,479
social networks had done and i thought

4370
02:27:14,879 --> 02:27:20,719
hmm maybe we did a spin on this but like

4371
02:27:18,478 --> 02:27:21,840
nowhere was our feet predestined like it

4372
02:27:20,719 --> 02:27:23,760
wasn't like

4373
02:27:21,840 --> 02:27:25,600
it wasn't written out anywhere that

4374
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:27,200
everything was going to go great and i

4375
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:29,120
often think the counterfactual like what

4376
02:27:27,200 --> 02:27:30,560
if it had not gone well i would've been

4377
02:27:29,120 --> 02:27:33,600
like i don't know that was fun we raised

4378
02:27:30,559 --> 02:27:35,680
some money we learned some stuff and

4379
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:37,680
and does it position you well for the

4380
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:39,200
next experience

4381
02:27:37,680 --> 02:27:41,040
that's the advice that i would give to

4382
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:42,720
anyone wanting to start something today

4383
02:27:41,040 --> 02:27:45,040
which is like

4384
02:27:42,719 --> 02:27:47,279
does this meet with your ultimate goals

4385
02:27:45,040 --> 02:27:49,840
not wealth not fame none of that because

4386
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:51,520
all of that by the way is like

4387
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:53,040
you can get super famous and super

4388
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:55,040
wealthy and

4389
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:57,200
i like i think generally those are not

4390
02:27:55,040 --> 02:27:58,880
things that

4391
02:27:57,200 --> 02:28:00,960
again it's easy to say with like a lot

4392
02:27:58,879 --> 02:28:02,879
of money that somehow like it's not good

4393
02:28:00,959 --> 02:28:04,719
to have a lot of money it's just

4394
02:28:02,879 --> 02:28:06,159
i think that complicates life enormously

4395
02:28:04,719 --> 02:28:07,760
in a way that people don't fully

4396
02:28:06,159 --> 02:28:09,840
comprehend so i think it's way more

4397
02:28:07,760 --> 02:28:11,520
interesting to shoot for can i make

4398
02:28:09,840 --> 02:28:13,920
something that people love

4399
02:28:11,520 --> 02:28:16,319
that provides value in the world that i

4400
02:28:13,920 --> 02:28:19,840
love building that i love working on

4401
02:28:16,318 --> 02:28:20,959
that i write that's um

4402
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:22,079
that's what i would do if i were

4403
02:28:20,959 --> 02:28:24,079
starting from scratch and by the way

4404
02:28:22,079 --> 02:28:26,000
like in some ways that i will do that

4405
02:28:24,079 --> 02:28:27,359
personally which is like choose the

4406
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:29,120
thing that you get up every morning

4407
02:28:27,359 --> 02:28:31,280
you're like i

4408
02:28:29,120 --> 02:28:32,960
love this

4409
02:28:31,280 --> 02:28:35,040
even when it's painful

4410
02:28:32,959 --> 02:28:37,039
even when it's painful what about a

4411
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:38,720
social network specifically if you were

4412
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:40,479
to imagine

4413
02:28:38,719 --> 02:28:42,799
put yourself in the mind of someone

4414
02:28:40,478 --> 02:28:44,478
compete against myself i can't give out

4415
02:28:42,799 --> 02:28:46,079
ideas okay i gotcha

4416
02:28:44,478 --> 02:28:48,719
no but it's like high level you like

4417
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:50,239
focus on community yeah

4418
02:28:48,719 --> 02:28:54,239
and yeah

4419
02:28:50,239 --> 02:28:56,239
i i said that as a as a half joke um in

4420
02:28:54,239 --> 02:28:58,079
all honesty i think these things are so

4421
02:28:56,239 --> 02:29:00,159
hard to build that like ideas are a dime

4422
02:28:58,079 --> 02:29:01,920
a dozen but um

4423
02:29:00,159 --> 02:29:02,799
you have to i talked about keeping it

4424
02:29:01,920 --> 02:29:04,478
simple

4425
02:29:02,799 --> 02:29:06,318
can i tell you which is a liberating

4426
02:29:04,478 --> 02:29:09,438
idea that model is yes it's three

4427
02:29:06,318 --> 02:29:11,439
circles and they overlap one circle is

4428
02:29:09,439 --> 02:29:13,280
uh what do i have experience at slash

4429
02:29:11,439 --> 02:29:14,800
what am i good at i don't like saying

4430
02:29:13,280 --> 02:29:15,840
what am i good at because it just like

4431
02:29:14,799 --> 02:29:18,239
seems like

4432
02:29:15,840 --> 02:29:19,920
what do i have experience in right what

4433
02:29:18,239 --> 02:29:22,159
can i bring to the table what am i

4434
02:29:19,920 --> 02:29:24,799
excited about is the other circle what

4435
02:29:22,159 --> 02:29:26,239
gets what's just super cool right that i

4436
02:29:24,799 --> 02:29:27,438
want to work on because even when this

4437
02:29:26,239 --> 02:29:29,039
is hard

4438
02:29:27,439 --> 02:29:30,318
um

4439
02:29:29,040 --> 02:29:31,520
i think it's so cool i want to stick

4440
02:29:30,318 --> 02:29:33,119
with it

4441
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:34,720
and the last circle is like what does

4442
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:36,160
the world need

4443
02:29:34,719 --> 02:29:37,679
and if that circle ain't there it

4444
02:29:36,159 --> 02:29:39,119
doesn't matter what you work on because

4445
02:29:37,680 --> 02:29:40,960
there are a lot of startups that exist

4446
02:29:39,120 --> 02:29:43,040
that just no one needs

4447
02:29:40,959 --> 02:29:45,279
or very small markets need

4448
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:47,680
but if you want to be successful i think

4449
02:29:45,280 --> 02:29:49,520
if you're like if you're good at it you

4450
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:51,120
have it sorry if you're good at it if

4451
02:29:49,520 --> 02:29:52,960
you're passionate about it and the world

4452
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:54,399
needs it i mean this sounds simple but

4453
02:29:52,959 --> 02:29:57,039
not enough people sit down and just

4454
02:29:54,398 --> 02:29:58,559
think about those circles and think

4455
02:29:57,040 --> 02:30:00,319
do these things overlapping can i get

4456
02:29:58,559 --> 02:30:01,920
that middle section it's small but can i

4457
02:30:00,318 --> 02:30:05,840
get that middle section

4458
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:07,600
um i think a lot about that personally

4459
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:11,200
and then you have to be really honest

4460
02:30:07,600 --> 02:30:14,399
about the circle that you're good at

4461
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:16,880
and really honest about the circle

4462
02:30:14,398 --> 02:30:19,439
that uh the world needs

4463
02:30:16,879 --> 02:30:22,318
and i suppose really honest about the

4464
02:30:19,439 --> 02:30:23,920
passion like what you actually love yeah

4465
02:30:22,318 --> 02:30:25,119
as opposed to like some kind of dream of

4466
02:30:23,920 --> 02:30:27,600
making money all those kind of stuff

4467
02:30:25,120 --> 02:30:29,760
like literally love i had a former

4468
02:30:27,600 --> 02:30:31,280
engineer who decided to start a startup

4469
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:32,880
and i was like are you sure you want to

4470
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:34,319
start a company versus like join

4471
02:30:32,879 --> 02:30:36,159
something else

4472
02:30:34,318 --> 02:30:39,039
because um

4473
02:30:36,159 --> 02:30:40,639
being a coach of an nba team and playing

4474
02:30:39,040 --> 02:30:42,240
basketball are two very very different

4475
02:30:40,639 --> 02:30:44,398
things

4476
02:30:42,239 --> 02:30:45,680
and like not everyone fully understands

4477
02:30:44,398 --> 02:30:47,840
the difference

4478
02:30:45,680 --> 02:30:50,000
i think you can kind of do it both

4479
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:51,840
um

4480
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,680
and i don't know jury's out on that one

4481
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:56,478
because like they're in the middle of it

4482
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:58,880
now so but it's really important to

4483
02:30:56,478 --> 02:31:00,959
figure out what you're good at not be

4484
02:30:58,879 --> 02:31:02,799
full of yourself like truly look at your

4485
02:31:00,959 --> 02:31:04,799
track record

4486
02:31:02,799 --> 02:31:06,879
um what's the saying like it ain't

4487
02:31:04,799 --> 02:31:09,039
bragging if you could if if you can do

4488
02:31:06,879 --> 02:31:11,199
it um

4489
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:13,600
but too many people

4490
02:31:11,200 --> 02:31:15,280
are delusional and like think they're

4491
02:31:13,600 --> 02:31:16,720
better at things than they actually are

4492
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:18,479
or think there's a bigger market than

4493
02:31:16,719 --> 02:31:20,079
there actually is just

4494
02:31:18,478 --> 02:31:23,199
when you confuse your passion for things

4495
02:31:20,079 --> 02:31:24,639
with a big market that's really scary

4496
02:31:23,200 --> 02:31:26,079
right like just because you think it's

4497
02:31:24,639 --> 02:31:27,519
cool doesn't mean that it's a big

4498
02:31:26,079 --> 02:31:29,760
business opportunity so like what

4499
02:31:27,520 --> 02:31:32,399
evidence do you have again i'm a fairly

4500
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:34,159
like i'm a strict rationalist on this

4501
02:31:32,398 --> 02:31:35,519
and like sometimes people don't like

4502
02:31:34,159 --> 02:31:38,639
working with me because i'm pretty

4503
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:41,520
pragmatic about things like i'm not

4504
02:31:38,639 --> 02:31:44,000
i'm not elon like i don't sit and make

4505
02:31:41,520 --> 02:31:46,000
bold proclamations about visiting mars

4506
02:31:44,000 --> 02:31:47,600
like that's just not how i work

4507
02:31:46,000 --> 02:31:48,879
i'm like okay i want to build this

4508
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:51,040
really cool thing that's fairly

4509
02:31:48,879 --> 02:31:53,599
practical and i think we could do it and

4510
02:31:51,040 --> 02:31:55,040
it's in this way and what's cool though

4511
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:56,399
is like that's just my sweet spot i'm

4512
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:58,399
not like

4513
02:31:56,398 --> 02:32:00,239
i just i can't i can't with a straight

4514
02:31:58,398 --> 02:32:01,599
face talk about the metaverse i can't i

4515
02:32:00,239 --> 02:32:04,000
just it's not me

4516
02:32:01,600 --> 02:32:05,680
uh what do you think about the the

4517
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:07,280
facebook renaming it

4518
02:32:05,680 --> 02:32:09,280
and that is a dick i just literally know

4519
02:32:07,280 --> 02:32:11,120
like i'm i'm fairly

4520
02:32:09,280 --> 02:32:13,040
i like to live in the next five years

4521
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:14,960
and like what what things can i get out

4522
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:16,560
in a year that people will use at scale

4523
02:32:14,959 --> 02:32:17,919
and

4524
02:32:16,559 --> 02:32:19,920
um

4525
02:32:17,920 --> 02:32:21,040
so it's just again those circles i think

4526
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:23,200
are different for different people but

4527
02:32:21,040 --> 02:32:25,439
it's important to realize that like

4528
02:32:23,200 --> 02:32:26,960
market matters you being good at it

4529
02:32:25,439 --> 02:32:29,359
matters and having passion for it

4530
02:32:26,959 --> 02:32:31,519
matters uh your question sorry

4531
02:32:29,359 --> 02:32:33,760
well unless

4532
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:34,800
on this topic in terms of funding

4533
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:38,359
is there

4534
02:32:34,799 --> 02:32:38,358
by way of advice

4535
02:32:39,200 --> 02:32:44,640
was funding in your own journey helpful

4536
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:46,080
unhelpful

4537
02:32:44,639 --> 02:32:48,398
like is there a right time to get

4538
02:32:46,079 --> 02:32:50,639
funding for funding venture funding or

4539
02:32:48,398 --> 02:32:52,959
anything borrow some money from your

4540
02:32:50,639 --> 02:32:55,199
parents i don't know

4541
02:32:52,959 --> 02:32:57,599
like is money get in the way does it

4542
02:32:55,200 --> 02:32:59,680
help is the timing important is there

4543
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:00,720
some kind of wisdom you can

4544
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:05,239
give there because you were

4545
02:33:00,719 --> 02:33:05,239
exceptionally successful very quickly

4546
02:33:06,478 --> 02:33:09,519
funding helps as long as it's from the

4547
02:33:08,159 --> 02:33:10,879
right people

4548
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:13,200
that includes yourself and i'll talk

4549
02:33:10,879 --> 02:33:15,199
about myself funding myself in in a

4550
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:17,840
second which is like because i can fund

4551
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:19,520
myself doing whatever projects i can do

4552
02:33:17,840 --> 02:33:21,439
i don't really have another person

4553
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:22,640
putting pressure on me except for myself

4554
02:33:21,439 --> 02:33:25,120
and that creates

4555
02:33:22,639 --> 02:33:27,358
strange dynamics right but let's like

4556
02:33:25,120 --> 02:33:29,840
talk about people getting funding from a

4557
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:31,760
venture capitalist initially

4558
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:34,159
uh we raised money from matt kohler at

4559
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:36,639
benchmark he's brilliant

4560
02:33:34,159 --> 02:33:39,520
amazing guy very thoughtful

4561
02:33:36,639 --> 02:33:41,119
and he was very helpful early on but i

4562
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:42,720
have stories from entrepreneurs where

4563
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:44,720
they raise money from the wrong person

4564
02:33:42,719 --> 02:33:46,639
or the wrong firm where incentives

4565
02:33:44,719 --> 02:33:48,799
weren't aligned

4566
02:33:46,639 --> 02:33:49,680
they didn't think in the same way

4567
02:33:48,799 --> 02:33:51,199
um

4568
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:53,359
and bad things happened because of that

4569
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:55,200
the border room was always noisy

4570
02:33:53,359 --> 02:33:57,040
there were fights like we just never had

4571
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:59,920
that matt was great

4572
02:33:57,040 --> 02:34:01,920
i think usu like capital these days is

4573
02:33:59,920 --> 02:34:03,600
kind of a dime a dozen right like as

4574
02:34:01,920 --> 02:34:05,439
long as you're fundable like it seems

4575
02:34:03,600 --> 02:34:06,880
like there's money out there this is

4576
02:34:05,439 --> 02:34:08,000
what i'm hearing

4577
02:34:06,879 --> 02:34:09,839
um

4578
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:11,680
it's really important that you are

4579
02:34:09,840 --> 02:34:13,680
aligned and that you think of raising

4580
02:34:11,680 --> 02:34:15,840
money as hiring someone for your team

4581
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:18,239
rather than taking money

4582
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:20,799
if capital is plentiful right

4583
02:34:18,239 --> 02:34:22,559
it provides a certain amount of pressure

4584
02:34:20,799 --> 02:34:24,639
to do the right thing that i think is

4585
02:34:22,559 --> 02:34:26,398
healthy for any startup and it keeps you

4586
02:34:24,639 --> 02:34:28,079
real and honest because they don't want

4587
02:34:26,398 --> 02:34:29,439
to lose their money they're paid to not

4588
02:34:28,079 --> 02:34:31,280
lose their money

4589
02:34:29,439 --> 02:34:33,680
the problem you know

4590
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:35,840
maybe i could de-personalize it but like

4591
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:37,520
i remember having lunch with elon it's

4592
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:38,960
only happened once

4593
02:34:37,520 --> 02:34:40,079
and i asked him

4594
02:34:38,959 --> 02:34:42,398
like i was trying to figure out what i

4595
02:34:40,079 --> 02:34:43,840
was doing after instagram right

4596
02:34:42,398 --> 02:34:45,680
and i asked him something about like

4597
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:47,120
angel investing and he looked at me with

4598
02:34:45,680 --> 02:34:50,159
a straight face and was like why the f

4599
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:51,760
would i do that like why like i was like

4600
02:34:50,159 --> 02:34:54,000
i don't know like you're connected like

4601
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:56,000
seems like he's like i only invested

4602
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:59,200
myself i was like

4603
02:34:56,000 --> 02:35:00,879
okay you know like not the confidence i

4604
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:01,760
was just like what a novel idea it's

4605
02:35:00,879 --> 02:35:04,318
like

4606
02:35:01,760 --> 02:35:06,960
yeah if you have money like why not just

4607
02:35:04,318 --> 02:35:08,478
put it against your bag and like yeah

4608
02:35:06,959 --> 02:35:09,679
enable

4609
02:35:08,478 --> 02:35:11,279
you

4610
02:35:09,680 --> 02:35:13,120
visiting mars or something right like

4611
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:14,800
that's awesome great but i had never

4612
02:35:13,120 --> 02:35:16,880
really thought of it that way

4613
02:35:14,799 --> 02:35:18,559
but also with that comes an interesting

4614
02:35:16,879 --> 02:35:19,519
dynamic where

4615
02:35:18,559 --> 02:35:21,519
um

4616
02:35:19,520 --> 02:35:23,359
you don't actually have

4617
02:35:21,520 --> 02:35:25,840
people who are gonna lose that money

4618
02:35:23,359 --> 02:35:27,520
telling you hey don't do this or hey you

4619
02:35:25,840 --> 02:35:29,520
need to face this reality so you need to

4620
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:32,319
create other versions

4621
02:35:29,520 --> 02:35:33,280
of that truth teller

4622
02:35:32,318 --> 02:35:34,879
and i

4623
02:35:33,280 --> 02:35:36,880
whatever i do next that's going to be

4624
02:35:34,879 --> 02:35:38,839
one of the interesting challenges is how

4625
02:35:36,879 --> 02:35:41,358
do you create that truth-telling

4626
02:35:38,840 --> 02:35:43,040
situation um and that's part of why by

4627
02:35:41,359 --> 02:35:44,800
the way i think someone like jack when

4628
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:45,520
you start square you have money but you

4629
02:35:44,799 --> 02:35:47,438
still

4630
02:35:45,520 --> 02:35:48,560
you bring on partners because i think it

4631
02:35:47,439 --> 02:35:51,359
creates

4632
02:35:48,559 --> 02:35:52,639
a truth-telling type environment um i'm

4633
02:35:51,359 --> 02:35:53,520
still trying to figure this out like i

4634
02:35:52,639 --> 02:35:54,959
like

4635
02:35:53,520 --> 02:35:56,640
it's an interesting

4636
02:35:54,959 --> 02:35:57,839
it's an interesting diamond so you're

4637
02:35:56,639 --> 02:35:59,680
thinking of

4638
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:01,520
perhaps launching some kind of venture

4639
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:02,479
where you're investing in yourself

4640
02:36:01,520 --> 02:36:04,640
i mean

4641
02:36:02,478 --> 02:36:07,039
is there in the books potentially i'm 37

4642
02:36:04,639 --> 02:36:08,559
going on 38 next month i have a long

4643
02:36:07,040 --> 02:36:10,640
life to live i'm not definitely not

4644
02:36:08,559 --> 02:36:11,600
gonna sit on the beach right

4645
02:36:10,639 --> 02:36:14,879
so

4646
02:36:11,600 --> 02:36:17,359
i'm gonna do something at some point and

4647
02:36:14,879 --> 02:36:19,358
i gotta imagine i will i will like help

4648
02:36:17,359 --> 02:36:20,559
fund it right so the other way of

4649
02:36:19,359 --> 02:36:22,239
thinking about this is you could park

4650
02:36:20,559 --> 02:36:23,840
your money in the smp and this is bad

4651
02:36:22,239 --> 02:36:25,840
because the smp has done wonderfully

4652
02:36:23,840 --> 02:36:29,439
well in the last year right

4653
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:30,398
or you can invest in yourself and um

4654
02:36:29,439 --> 02:36:31,520
if you're not going to invest in

4655
02:36:30,398 --> 02:36:33,279
yourself you probably shouldn't do a

4656
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:35,680
startup it's kind of the way of thinking

4657
02:36:33,280 --> 02:36:36,960
about it

4658
02:36:35,680 --> 02:36:39,280
and you can invest in yourself in the

4659
02:36:36,959 --> 02:36:41,679
way elon does which is basically uh go

4660
02:36:39,280 --> 02:36:43,359
all in on this investment maybe that's

4661
02:36:41,680 --> 02:36:45,280
one way to achieve accountability is

4662
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:46,318
like you're kind of screwed if you're if

4663
02:36:45,280 --> 02:36:48,800
you fail

4664
02:36:46,318 --> 02:36:48,799
yeah that's

4665
02:36:48,840 --> 02:36:53,120
yeah i i personally like that i like

4666
02:36:51,120 --> 02:36:55,040
burning bridges behind me so that i'm

4667
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:57,200
if it fails

4668
02:36:55,040 --> 02:37:00,319
yeah yeah yeah

4669
02:36:57,200 --> 02:37:01,760
it's really important though

4670
02:37:00,318 --> 02:37:03,519
one of the things i think mark said to

4671
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:05,280
me early on

4672
02:37:03,520 --> 02:37:08,640
that that sticks with me that i think is

4673
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:10,479
true uh we were talking about people who

4674
02:37:08,639 --> 02:37:11,680
had left like operating roles and

4675
02:37:10,478 --> 02:37:12,879
started doing venture or something it

4676
02:37:11,680 --> 02:37:14,479
was like a lot of people convinced

4677
02:37:12,879 --> 02:37:15,839
themselves they work really hard like

4678
02:37:14,478 --> 02:37:17,760
they think they work really hard and

4679
02:37:15,840 --> 02:37:19,600
they they put on the show and in their

4680
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:22,159
minds they work really hard but they

4681
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:23,920
don't work very hard

4682
02:37:22,159 --> 02:37:26,239
there is something about lighting a fire

4683
02:37:23,920 --> 02:37:28,478
underneath you and burning bridges such

4684
02:37:26,239 --> 02:37:29,280
that you can't turn back yeah that i

4685
02:37:28,478 --> 02:37:30,478
think

4686
02:37:29,280 --> 02:37:32,319
you know we didn't talk about this

4687
02:37:30,478 --> 02:37:33,840
specifically but i think you're right

4688
02:37:32,318 --> 02:37:36,000
there is

4689
02:37:33,840 --> 02:37:39,200
you need to have that because there's

4690
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:41,760
this self-delusion at a certain scale

4691
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:43,120
oh i have so many board calls oh like we

4692
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,360
have all these things to figure out it's

4693
02:37:43,120 --> 02:37:44,880
like

4694
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:46,159
[Music]

4695
02:37:44,879 --> 02:37:48,959
this is one of the hard parts about it

4696
02:37:46,159 --> 02:37:50,639
being an operator is like

4697
02:37:48,959 --> 02:37:52,719
there are so many people that have made

4698
02:37:50,639 --> 02:37:54,239
a lot of money not operating

4699
02:37:52,719 --> 02:37:56,959
but operating is just one of the hardest

4700
02:37:54,239 --> 02:37:58,079
things on earth it is just so effing

4701
02:37:56,959 --> 02:38:00,079
hard

4702
02:37:58,079 --> 02:38:02,000
it is stressful it is you're dealing

4703
02:38:00,079 --> 02:38:04,719
with real humans you're not just like

4704
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:06,719
throwing capital in and hoping it grows

4705
02:38:04,719 --> 02:38:08,478
i'm not undermining the vc mindset i

4706
02:38:06,719 --> 02:38:10,318
think it's a wonderful thing and needed

4707
02:38:08,478 --> 02:38:11,438
and and so many wonderful vcs i've

4708
02:38:10,318 --> 02:38:12,639
worked with

4709
02:38:11,439 --> 02:38:14,639
but um

4710
02:38:12,639 --> 02:38:17,760
yeah like when your ass is on the line

4711
02:38:14,639 --> 02:38:17,760
and it's your money it's

4712
02:38:18,559 --> 02:38:21,680
talk to me in 10 years we'll see how it

4713
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:23,120
goes

4714
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:24,639
yeah but like you're saying that is a

4715
02:38:23,120 --> 02:38:26,160
source when you wake up in the morning

4716
02:38:24,639 --> 02:38:28,079
as uh

4717
02:38:26,159 --> 02:38:29,920
you look forward to the day full of

4718
02:38:28,079 --> 02:38:31,920
challenges that's also where you can

4719
02:38:29,920 --> 02:38:34,639
find happiness let me ask you about love

4720
02:38:31,920 --> 02:38:36,559
and friendship sure what's the role

4721
02:38:34,639 --> 02:38:38,000
in this heck of a difficult journey

4722
02:38:36,559 --> 02:38:39,519
you've been on

4723
02:38:38,000 --> 02:38:42,478
of love

4724
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:45,520
of uh friendship what's the role of love

4725
02:38:42,478 --> 02:38:45,519
in the human condition

4726
02:38:45,600 --> 02:38:49,600
well first things first the woman i

4727
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:52,239
married my wife nicole

4728
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:54,159
no way i could do what i do

4729
02:38:52,239 --> 02:38:56,799
if we weren't together she had the

4730
02:38:54,159 --> 02:38:58,239
filter idea yeah yeah exactly we didn't

4731
02:38:56,799 --> 02:38:59,279
go over that story

4732
02:38:58,239 --> 02:39:02,318
um

4733
02:38:59,280 --> 02:39:04,159
everything is a partnership right and

4734
02:39:02,318 --> 02:39:05,600
to achieve great things it's not about

4735
02:39:04,159 --> 02:39:07,200
like someone pulling their weight in

4736
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:08,800
places like it's not like someone's

4737
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:11,040
supporting you

4738
02:39:08,799 --> 02:39:13,679
so that you could do this other thing

4739
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:15,280
it's literally like

4740
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:16,479
you know i mike and i and our

4741
02:39:15,280 --> 02:39:18,159
partnership

4742
02:39:16,478 --> 02:39:19,279
as co-founders

4743
02:39:18,159 --> 02:39:20,559
is fascinating because i don't think

4744
02:39:19,280 --> 02:39:22,880
instagram would have happened without

4745
02:39:20,559 --> 02:39:25,680
that partnership like

4746
02:39:22,879 --> 02:39:28,559
either him or me alone no way

4747
02:39:25,680 --> 02:39:29,359
we pushed and pulled each other in a way

4748
02:39:28,559 --> 02:39:31,039
that

4749
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:32,239
allowed us to build a better thing

4750
02:39:31,040 --> 02:39:34,399
because of it

4751
02:39:32,239 --> 02:39:36,318
nicole sure like she pushed me to work

4752
02:39:34,398 --> 02:39:38,398
on the filters early on and yes that's

4753
02:39:36,318 --> 02:39:40,239
exciting it's a fun story right

4754
02:39:38,398 --> 02:39:42,318
but the truth of it is

4755
02:39:40,239 --> 02:39:44,879
being able to like level with someone

4756
02:39:42,318 --> 02:39:47,760
about how hard the process is and have

4757
02:39:44,879 --> 02:39:49,199
someone see you for who you are before

4758
02:39:47,760 --> 02:39:51,040
instagram

4759
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:53,040
and know that there's a constant you

4760
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:54,319
throughout all of this

4761
02:39:53,040 --> 02:39:55,760
and be able to call you when you're

4762
02:39:54,318 --> 02:39:57,359
drifting from that

4763
02:39:55,760 --> 02:39:59,520
but also support you when you're trying

4764
02:39:57,359 --> 02:40:01,680
to stick with that that's

4765
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:03,280
i mean that's that's true

4766
02:40:01,680 --> 02:40:05,439
friendship slash love whatever you want

4767
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:07,120
to call it um

4768
02:40:05,439 --> 02:40:09,120
but also for someone not to care i

4769
02:40:07,120 --> 02:40:10,479
remember nicole saying hey like i know

4770
02:40:09,120 --> 02:40:11,200
you're gonna do this instagram thing you

4771
02:40:10,478 --> 02:40:12,959
should

4772
02:40:11,200 --> 02:40:15,279
i guess it was bourbon at the time you

4773
02:40:12,959 --> 02:40:16,959
should do it because um

4774
02:40:15,279 --> 02:40:18,880
you know even if it doesn't work we can

4775
02:40:16,959 --> 02:40:22,159
move to like a smaller apartment and

4776
02:40:18,879 --> 02:40:24,239
it'll be fine like we'll make it work

4777
02:40:22,159 --> 02:40:26,559
how beautiful is that right yeah that's

4778
02:40:24,239 --> 02:40:28,239
almost like a superpower it gives you

4779
02:40:26,559 --> 02:40:30,318
permission to fail and somehow that

4780
02:40:28,239 --> 02:40:32,639
actually leads to success but also she's

4781
02:40:30,318 --> 02:40:34,799
like the least impressed about instagram

4782
02:40:32,639 --> 02:40:36,639
of anyone she's like yeah it's great but

4783
02:40:34,799 --> 02:40:39,358
like i love you for you like i like that

4784
02:40:36,639 --> 02:40:40,478
you're like a decent beautiful

4785
02:40:39,359 --> 02:40:42,159
it's beautiful

4786
02:40:40,478 --> 02:40:43,599
with the uh with the gantt chart and

4787
02:40:42,159 --> 02:40:46,478
thanksgiving which i still think is a

4788
02:40:43,600 --> 02:40:48,399
brilliant effing idea thank you um big

4789
02:40:46,478 --> 02:40:49,840
ridiculous question

4790
02:40:48,398 --> 02:40:52,959
have you uh

4791
02:40:49,840 --> 02:40:54,799
you're you're old and wise at this stage

4792
02:40:52,959 --> 02:40:56,398
so have you discovered meaning to this

4793
02:40:54,799 --> 02:40:58,398
whole thing why the hell are we

4794
02:40:56,398 --> 02:41:00,318
descendants of um

4795
02:40:58,398 --> 02:41:02,719
apes here on earth what's the meaning of

4796
02:41:00,318 --> 02:41:06,159
it what's the meaning of life i haven't

4797
02:41:02,719 --> 02:41:07,840
and it and i i am inco so the crazy so

4798
02:41:06,159 --> 02:41:09,760
the best learning

4799
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:12,478
for me has been like no matter what

4800
02:41:09,760 --> 02:41:14,318
level of success you achieve

4801
02:41:12,478 --> 02:41:15,840
you're still worried about similar

4802
02:41:14,318 --> 02:41:17,519
things maybe on a slightly different

4803
02:41:15,840 --> 02:41:18,960
scale you're still

4804
02:41:17,520 --> 02:41:20,560
concerned about the same thing you're

4805
02:41:18,959 --> 02:41:22,559
still self-conscious about the same

4806
02:41:20,559 --> 02:41:23,920
things it's like

4807
02:41:22,559 --> 02:41:26,559
and

4808
02:41:23,920 --> 02:41:28,239
actually that moment going through that

4809
02:41:26,559 --> 02:41:30,639
is what makes you believe there's got to

4810
02:41:28,239 --> 02:41:32,959
be like more machinery to life or

4811
02:41:30,639 --> 02:41:35,278
purpose to life and that that we're all

4812
02:41:32,959 --> 02:41:36,559
chasing these materialistic things but

4813
02:41:35,279 --> 02:41:38,560
you start

4814
02:41:36,559 --> 02:41:40,079
start realizing like um it's almost like

4815
02:41:38,559 --> 02:41:42,719
you know the truman show when he gets

4816
02:41:40,079 --> 02:41:44,639
the edge and he like knocks against it

4817
02:41:42,719 --> 02:41:46,239
he's like what like there's this

4818
02:41:44,639 --> 02:41:48,398
awakening that happens when you get to

4819
02:41:46,239 --> 02:41:50,159
that edge that you realize oh

4820
02:41:48,398 --> 02:41:53,439
like sure it's great it's great that we

4821
02:41:50,159 --> 02:41:55,520
all chase money and fame and and success

4822
02:41:53,439 --> 02:41:57,200
but you hit the edge and and i'm not

4823
02:41:55,520 --> 02:41:58,880
even claiming i hit an edge like like

4824
02:41:57,200 --> 02:42:00,720
elon's hit an edge like there's clearly

4825
02:41:58,879 --> 02:42:02,478
larger scales

4826
02:42:00,719 --> 02:42:04,000
but what's cool is you learn that like

4827
02:42:02,478 --> 02:42:05,278
it doesn't actually matter and that

4828
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:06,478
there are all these other things that

4829
02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:08,800
truly matter

4830
02:42:06,478 --> 02:42:10,879
um that's not a case for working less

4831
02:42:08,799 --> 02:42:12,719
hard that's not a case for taking it

4832
02:42:10,879 --> 02:42:13,759
easy that's not a case for the four day

4833
02:42:12,719 --> 02:42:16,159
work week

4834
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:18,318
what that is a case for is designing

4835
02:42:16,159 --> 02:42:19,840
your life exactly the way you want to

4836
02:42:18,318 --> 02:42:22,000
design it because

4837
02:42:19,840 --> 02:42:24,559
i don't know i i think we go around the

4838
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:27,520
or you know the sun a certain number of

4839
02:42:24,559 --> 02:42:29,680
times and then we die and then that's it

4840
02:42:27,520 --> 02:42:31,760
that's me are you afraid of that moment

4841
02:42:29,680 --> 02:42:34,559
no not at all in fact

4842
02:42:31,760 --> 02:42:34,559
at least not yet

4843
02:42:36,000 --> 02:42:40,719
listen i'm like a pilot like i do

4844
02:42:38,719 --> 02:42:45,358
crazy things and i like

4845
02:42:40,719 --> 02:42:48,799
um no i like if anything i'm like oh

4846
02:42:45,359 --> 02:42:50,800
i gotta choose uh uh mindfully and

4847
02:42:48,799 --> 02:42:52,318
purposefully the thing i am doing right

4848
02:42:50,799 --> 02:42:54,239
now

4849
02:42:52,318 --> 02:42:55,680
and not just fall into it because you're

4850
02:42:54,239 --> 02:42:57,119
gonna wake up one day and ask yourself

4851
02:42:55,680 --> 02:43:00,479
why the hell you spent the last 10 years

4852
02:42:57,120 --> 02:43:03,760
doing x y or z yeah so i guess

4853
02:43:00,478 --> 02:43:06,159
my like shorter answer to this is

4854
02:43:03,760 --> 02:43:08,398
doing things on purpose

4855
02:43:06,159 --> 02:43:10,239
because you choose to do them

4856
02:43:08,398 --> 02:43:11,840
so important in life

4857
02:43:10,239 --> 02:43:14,079
and not just like floating down the

4858
02:43:11,840 --> 02:43:16,960
river of life hitting branches along the

4859
02:43:14,079 --> 02:43:19,200
way because you will hit branches right

4860
02:43:16,959 --> 02:43:21,119
but rather like literally plotting a

4861
02:43:19,200 --> 02:43:24,880
course and not having a 10-year plan but

4862
02:43:21,120 --> 02:43:28,160
just choosing every day to opt in

4863
02:43:24,879 --> 02:43:29,438
that i think has been more

4864
02:43:28,159 --> 02:43:30,559
like i haven't figured out the meaning

4865
02:43:29,439 --> 02:43:32,559
of life by any stretch of the

4866
02:43:30,559 --> 02:43:33,840
imagination but it certainly isn't money

4867
02:43:32,559 --> 02:43:36,159
and it certainly isn't fame and it

4868
02:43:33,840 --> 02:43:38,000
certainly isn't travel and it's like and

4869
02:43:36,159 --> 02:43:40,239
it's way more of like opting into the

4870
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:43,200
game you love playing

4871
02:43:40,239 --> 02:43:46,799
every day opting in just opting in and

4872
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:50,159
like it's don't let it happen you opt in

4873
02:43:46,799 --> 02:43:51,119
kevin uh it's great to end on the

4874
02:43:50,159 --> 02:43:52,879

02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:54,479

amazing conversation a lot of fun thank

technical world and i can't honestly

4880
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:04,398
