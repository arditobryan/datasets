little trash

7
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:20,719
given his wild online antics and his

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,279
boxing match with jake paul

9
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,759

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,239
here's my conversation with ben askren

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,400
before we talk about

27
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,959
your incredible wrestling career your

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
mma career let me ask you i have to ask

29
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:15,438
you

30
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,400
what did you think about the jake paul

31
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:20,239
versus tyron woodley fight

32
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,799
uh well i thought i mean i'm obviously

33
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:25,438
unbiased i thought tyrone won

34
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,040
i had five rounds of three

35
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,399
again this maybe this is my bias in the

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,840
way i was seeing it i thought he was

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,680
more effective with the striking and he

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,719
was more aggressive no jake had more

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,799
volume

40
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:36,640
um but that was the only like thing i

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,159
would give him and i guess a lot of

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,519
people just didn't see it that way they

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,960
thought he landed more significant

44
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,640
punches i just didn't think anyone

45
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:45,280
really did any damage

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,239
it was a split decision split decision

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,519
yeah were you surprised

48
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,039
um

49
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,640
well there's a thing so the thing i said

50
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,399
when i went in to fight him and said we

51
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,399
don't really maybe he's good maybe he's

52
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,759
not we have no we really have no idea to

53
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,359
this point you know

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,959
and so

55
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:04,078
i knew tyrone was a lot better boxing

56
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,359
than i was and so i thought okay tyron's

57
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:07,438
i think it's a good likelihood that

58
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:09,520
tyron beats him up

59
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,280
um but there's a chance that jake's kind

60
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,640
of good at this and i think that's kind

61
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,159
of what played out is

62
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,159
he's kind of good at it even if you saw

63
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:18,159
the way i saw it he still was impressive

64
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:20,560
in his showing and he's obviously put a

65
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:23,039
lot of time into it so he's

66
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,878
he's not bad we'll say that much you

67
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,959
know but isn't it surprising to you that

68
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:28,159
like uh elite level

69
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,080
athlete

70
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,159
combat athlete

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,319
lost to somebody who just takes it

72
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:36,560
really seriously but is nevertheless not

73
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,479
elite level um

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,719
hmm but but i think boxing is a really

75
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,719
specific rule set uh so we'll speak

76
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:45,439
about tyra not myself tyra had good

77
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,400
striking but obviously it was his first

78
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:50,400
boxing match ever um and within mixed

79
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,920
martial arts you have the

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
the fear of the takedown and the fear of

81
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:55,119
the kick and fear of other things to go

82
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,439
along with the punching and so if you

83
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,158
look at tyron throughout his mma crew a

84
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,479
lot of times what set up his punches

85
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,079
were like level change fakes at a

86
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:05,919
takedown they dropped boom and then

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,360
something comes over the top right so

88
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,958
there's many more elements to worry

89
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,000
about mixed martial arts whereas boxing

90
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,680
there's only one it was his first fight

91
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,959
yes i thought everyone was gonna win i

92
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,159
thought this was gonna happen but like i

93
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,598
said i mean it's pretty evident that

94
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,000
jake's

95
00:03:17,598 --> 00:03:21,598
he's not bad at boxing he's pretty solid

96
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,120
you know he gets in there and works hard

97
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:24,878
at it i guess

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,599
out of ten times how many times do you

99
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:29,280
think jake wins i guess turn he gets

100
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,199
tyron

101
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,759
they fight again and again and again

102
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,039
like iterative yeah so i mean i i part

103
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:36,878
of the thing is

104
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,239
okay so jake's corner said you need a

105
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,639
knockout going into the eighth round

106
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,000
right so i think they thought

107
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:43,598
maybe they're trying to motivate him but

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,199
i i don't see that way because if they

109
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,798
were actually thought that he was

110
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,639
winning why would they encourage him to

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,000
take a dumb risk when tyron has cleared

112
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:52,238
his knockout power right it's a really

113
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,519
stupid coaching philosophy if that's

114
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,719
what you're thinking so you obviously

115
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,640
are thinking hey this is actually in the

116
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,199
balance it's competitive

117
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,798
um and i feel like tyron thought maybe

118
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,839
he was winning and didn't have the

119
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,920
urgency necessary and so i think he

120
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
there's a chance he turns it up a lot

121
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:08,958
hmm

122
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,438
man i wouldn't want to watch him again

123
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,878
before i i so yeah i have this problem

124
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,438
with my personality here's my

125
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:16,959
personality lex um i have an issue with

126
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,639
not being able to give really exact

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,000
answers so i hate giving you an answer

128
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,240
that like

129
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,399
i don't feel like is 100 calculated yeah

130
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,918
so um i would like to see them go once

131
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:27,439
more because i would like to see hey can

132
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,758
tire if because if tyron can turn up the

133
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,560
pace and nj can't handle it then i think

134
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,639
it's an eight one or nine two right um

135
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,000
if it goes the exact same way and maybe

136
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,680
tyrone was a close split decision i'm

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,040
saying oh well it's probably close every

138
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,360
single time we're probably gonna get a

139
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,560
five to five type of thing you know so

140
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,280
it's like

141
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,959
i feel like out of one match it's not

142
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,319
totally indicative of what the future is

143
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,319
gonna look like i feel like tyrone would

144
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,000
get a knockout and then you would still

145
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,918
be in the same place

146
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,040
like not not knowing

147
00:04:53,918 --> 00:05:00,000
not know what to predict okay

148
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,919
so your fight with jake paul

149
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
looking back you have had a little bit

150
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:05,839
of time now

151
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,879
uh how would you analyze that fight

152
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,279
uh

153
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,120
well i mean the fight specifically i got

154
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,198
cracked with an overhand right so i mean

155
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,759
it kind of sucks

156
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
um i would say

157
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,600
you know this is why everyone's like i i

158
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,720
don't i really don't care um and

159
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,320
everyone's like wow

160
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
it turns your reputation it's like well

161
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:26,240
i wanted to do it i had an enjoyable

162
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,399
time training and in the build up

163
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,519
obviously i wasn't skillful enough to to

164
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:31,599
get to win

165
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,279
but if i even even despite the fact that

166
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,960
i know it's going to have what happened

167
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,399
if someone asked me to do it again i

168
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,478
probably would have done it again you

169
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,239
know and so the way i was thinking about

170
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:42,079
when i was deciding whether to do it or

171
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,038
not because i got the offer it's like

172
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:47,120
okay is this money it can change my life

173
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,120
yeah it could right it's not gonna

174
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,038
double my net worth but it's gonna add

175
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,319
significantly make my life easier number

176
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:54,159
two is like when i was in high school we

177
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,199
used to do boxing matches for free just

178
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,400
because we thought it was fun when we

179
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,919
didn't have something going on friday

180
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:59,279
night me and my buddies would get

181
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:00,560
together and we had some boxing goals in

182
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,478
that basement and we'd punch each other

183
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,839
in the head so it's like for something i

184
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:05,120
think is enjoyable nothing to pay me a

185
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,279
whole bunch of money

186
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,478
yeah sure i'll do it

187
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,399
would you

188
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:12,159
do you think if you got the rematch if

189
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:14,000
you did the rematch would you

190
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,439
what are the odds you win okay well it's

191
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,879
not probably not very good i think he's

192
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,399
pretty good actually and i'm not very

193
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,199
good now

194
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,159
at a low point for me because uh so when

195
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,759
i started training for that i was like

196
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
215 pounds which is the heaviest ever

197
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,479
bed i came off my hip surgery i

198
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,399
literally

199
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,639
like when i said

200
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,918
yes like i'll do it like i had literally

201
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,478
started working out like the week before

202
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,839
for the first time in my you know since

203
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,120
the surgery because i wasn't able to do

204
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,239
anything

205
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,840
so could i could i perform better yeah

206
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,560
but now after watching him box tyler i'm

207
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:47,038
like if you ask me ben can you be tyron

208
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,439
prob probably not i don't think i can be

209
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,120
tyron so awesome

210
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:53,120
crack and boxing yeah so my chances of

211
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,918
beating him you know and

212
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,598
watching that card it's like damn like

213
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,519
kind of fun to box someone who i know

214
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,279
sucks so i know it can beat that that's

215
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,399
what would be fun you know because like

216
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:05,198
they're training their

217
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,279
preparation was fun but then obviously i

218
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,720
got my butt kicked that [ __ ] that sucked

219
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:09,839
you know can i swear on this podcast

220
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,680
yeah of course okay well i was gonna

221
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,079
drop an fba but i wasn't quite sure

222
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,840
i think that sucked as i swear no you

223
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,680
could you could drop all all of the

224
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,679
f-bombs you want so

225
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,280
preparation was do you think you were

226
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,959
more prepared for that fight or the

227
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,959
the jordan barrels exhibition

228
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,199
i mean like how did you approach it

229
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,959
mentally you know um

230
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,560
well the burroughs thing i i obviously

231
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:36,159
it's okay so when i retired the first

232
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,879
time in 2017

233
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,240
burroughs was the only current like

234
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,240
we'll say really elite level wrestler

235
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,000
that i'd never trained with um i was

236
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,840
really good friends with nebraska's head

237
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
assistant coach still am and i said hey

238
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:48,719
i just want i'm going to pay my own way

239
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,560
i want to train with jordan's i want to

240
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,000
see what it feels like you know i want

241
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,000
to get in there and mix it up i mix it

242
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,199
up with david taylor and kyle dake i

243
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,120
mean there's just some adult wrestling

244
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,720
that i love

245
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,280
and so i flew myself down there in

246
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,879
january of 2018 and i spent four days

247
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,878
training with jordan it was a really

248
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,520
good time it gave me some great insight

249
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,960
into how he thinks and you know what a

250
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,399
great champion is

251
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,478
what was the like training with him like

252
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:15,120
what can you get some insights yeah of

253
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:18,399
course like what the

254
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:20,639
like how hard is the the live training

255
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,079
is it more drilling is it technical like

256
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,079
how does his

257
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:25,839
it seems like his style is very

258
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:28,000
different than yours so how does that

259
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:29,439
match up in the room in terms of like

260
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,680
what you learn from each other that kind

261
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,440
of thing we went full life for one i

262
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,038
think it was like 12 or 15 minutes ago

263
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,279
where we just go wrestle um we did a

264
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:41,918
bunch of simulated live but obviously he

265
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,759
he had so i was a senior in college when

266
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,199
he was a freshman in nebraska and so we

267
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,399
our teams had dueled each other he was

268
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,000
obviously a lot smaller at that point in

269
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,919
time um but he had followed my career

270
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,639
and so when i went in there it was like

271
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,599
hey

272
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:55,278
i know you're really good at this

273
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,959
position what about this position what

274
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,439
are you trying to do how exactly does it

275
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,119
work and then let's wrestle there you

276
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,600
know and then hey what about this

277
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,399
position and so you know we would spend

278
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,680
30 to 40 minutes talking about that

279
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,039
position on the ground or it was like uh

280
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,278
one was the chest strap it wasn't for

281
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,639
headlock one was uh i don't know it's

282
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,919
called what we call the lightning dump

283
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:17,759
but it's a

284
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:19,199
the lightning dome yeah

285
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,240
my buddy's name was lightning luke smith

286
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,920
in high school and he was the first

287
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,839
person i saw do it so usually when i see

288
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,719
someone do something then i name that

289
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,279
move after them got it um

290
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,639
i know right great name it's good so uh

291
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,759
yeah but so what i said with that is

292
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:32,958
like

293
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,080
okay he was still trying to be the best

294
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:35,359
in the world i was just trying to go

295
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,080
work out jordan bros because i enjoy

296
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,159
wrestling yeah um

297
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,320
is like someone who at that point what

298
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:44,799
he has five world titles at that four or

299
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
five at that point a lot and so usually

300
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,319
high school kids is like hey this is the

301
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,080
guy who's the best in the world who's

302
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,000
bringing someone in and saying how do i

303
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,759
do this how do i do that what about this

304
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,159
what about that and so the level of

305
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:58,240
inquisit inquisition that's a hard word

306
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,838
inquisitiveness he has

307
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,519
is really impressive and then it's

308
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,959
obvious why he got to the level he did

309
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,039
because he's figuring out all these

310
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:06,159
little situations and that's honestly

311
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,599
one of the biggest things i think

312
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,039
wrestlers

313
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,959
a lot of wrestlers fail to do as they

314
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,879
get older even when they get to early

315
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:15,199
college age they say this is my style

316
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:17,200
this is what i do i'm going to lift and

317
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,879
work out hard and i'm

318
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,160
and i'm not gonna anything in my game

319
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:21,759
you know whereas

320
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,439
you've seen many progressions in jordan

321
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,319
bros games he just made his 10th world

322
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,320
team

323
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,000
and you yeah and you know if you have a

324
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,519
really keen eye you've been able to

325
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,799
watch him change

326
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,159
you know i've been watching him since

327
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,879
2007 2007.

328
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,799
he's changed so much and obviously still

329
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,720
maintained a world-class level almost

330
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,719
the entire time

331
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,480
when you say change like what changed

332
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,320
because he's he's got that double leg

333
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,600
yeah but you're saying double anymore

334
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,959
was that he like hit his double leg for

335
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,639
the first time because alex dier he hit

336
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,479
him in years

337
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,600
yeah so that's like when people think

338
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,159
about jordan bros they think about the

339
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,839
double leg because in his early years

340
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,879
fire he had a great doubling right and

341
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,720
even so in those years i would say

342
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,559
the the biggest thing with jordan bros

343
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,320
double leg was it

344
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,559
his level of explosiveness it was his

345
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,800
level of persistence he would shoot and

346
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,319
shoot and shoot and shoot and it would a

347
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,078
lot of times would be from fun creative

348
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,160
angles and out of scrambles i'll say

349
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,519
he's on you you know and just he was

350
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,360
just super persistent with it and i

351
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,278
think that was probably the key

352
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,560
and then you saw

353
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:22,159
you know when he came out to won the

354
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,399
first world championship in 2011 it was

355
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:25,759
kind of that type of mentality and then

356
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,799
shortly after then obviously everyone

357
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:28,000
was starting to lower their stance

358
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:30,399
getting lower and he developed a really

359
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,399
good like mantis go behind series where

360
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:33,600
he would go one way the other way then

361
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,679
he started developing a really good like

362
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,480
low single ankle pick type thing you

363
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,639
know

364
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,600
and then his his hand fighting got

365
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,759
really tremendous like 15 16 17 his hand

366
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,759
fighting was really good and now i just

367
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,360
commented at the 21 trials like

368
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,600
a few of the defensive sequences he got

369
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,879
into was like holy [ __ ] like just not

370
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,320
from an athletic team but from a

371
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,879
technical standpoint the things he were

372
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,399
doing was just tremendous so i've seen

373
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,559
him as someone like who's continued to

374
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,559
reinvent themselves over the course of

375
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,759
the last 10 12 years

376
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:06,239
especially in the as a junior and senior

377
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,639
in college you're exceptionally dominant

378
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,200
yeah if you were to face him at the peak

379
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,600
both of your peaks of ncaa wrestling

380
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,879
could you uh could you beat them and if

381
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,079
you can beat them

382
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:20,559
well of course you can beat them yeah uh

383
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,638
how do you solve the jordan boroughs

384
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:25,759
well uh so for a folk style wrestling

385
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,440
stand folk style yeah so you know he he

386
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,600
had some competitive matches his junior

387
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,519
senior year he had a 2-1 win over uh or

388
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,839
maybe it's 3-2 over michael chandler who

389
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,639
is my teammate who's fighting uc now he

390
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,639
had a two-in win over tyler caldwell um

391
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,799
so i think you can glean some insight

392
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,079
into that you know he got written

393
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,679
he got so mad about this up on the

394
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,278
podcast so during chrono we had to make

395
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,199
up all kinds of [ __ ] to talk about

396
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:50,000
yeah and we were doing like the last 10

397
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,839
years best 165s and i said kyle dake

398
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,039
would ride him for over a minute oh wow

399
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,480
he got so mad you want to come on the

400
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,919
podcast the next day so hopefully he

401
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,120
doesn't listen to this he's like [ __ ]

402
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:00,639
you man you know um but you know what

403
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,560
when was this this is during corona

404
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,159
corona last year he got mad we were

405
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,638
talking about we were before the trials

406
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,159
yeah correct yeah so um

407
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,759
you know michael channel wrote him for

408
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:12,240
two minutes plus and that was his junior

409
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,600
year not his senior year sure right but

410
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,519
it's close

411
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,879
um so i think there's some things there

412
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,278
i think the interesting thing would be

413
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:20,639
if i would have stuck around right so i

414
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,039
chose to go into mixed martial arts

415
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,320
after 2008 i would have been 74 and he

416
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:25,838
would have been 74 so we would have to

417
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,600
wrestle and then i think that the

418
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,279
freestyle jordan burroughs puzzle is a

419
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,200
lot more difficult to solve than the

420
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,879
folk style jordan burroughs puzzle and i

421
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,040
think i don't think he would i think he

422
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:36,958
would acknowledge that he's much better

423
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,480
freestyle than he was at folk style oh

424
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,359
you know although he was very good he's

425
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,920
better this is like raw speed

426
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,560
explosiveness um presents a problem to

427
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,639
you well so he was never i mean he

428
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:50,559
didn't ex really excel on the mat in

429
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,240
kind of either style in

430
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:54,000
freestyle he has got some good lace

431
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,759
transitions but in folks that like his

432
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,320
whole like in his entire college career

433
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,319
think he has like 10 pins which is

434
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,360
almost nothing you know so he was

435
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,879
gaining no value off the top position he

436
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,879
was good enough on most people to get

437
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:08,559
off bottom without it being an issue but

438
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,078
it wasn't like oh my gosh this is an

439
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:11,599
area where we have to be careful there's

440
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:13,278
a lot of things here

441
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,399
you know it's just he wasn't gaining

442
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:18,078
value there whereas in freestyle he i

443
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,078
don't say never but the amount of times

444
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:22,399
he gets turned is incredibly rare very

445
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,679
very rare um and he does have a lace

446
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:27,519
transition so he gets a lot of points

447
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,439
there so and obviously freestyle is

448
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,959
it can be geared way more in the neutral

449
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,360
position right we're only doing

450
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,399
takedowns so yeah were you surprised

451
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,519
that

452
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,639
he lost to dake in the trials to kyle

453
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,120
dick

454
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,198
oh kyle's so so he's so good right i

455
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,360
mean i think i think his performance in

456
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:47,599
the olympics was uh

457
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,360
was his last name which was shocking too

458
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,440
i mean we never seen it happen to kyle

459
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,440
dake you know he's been a guy who's

460
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,720
competed with jordan burroughs forever

461
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,079
and obviously he was on the losing side

462
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,800
for a while and now he's on the winning

463
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:01,039
side um but i think a lot of people

464
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,599
thought it was a coin flip and i think

465
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:05,599
actually kyle digg made it feel like

466
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,360
it's not a coin flip it feel it now to

467
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,959
me it feels like kyle digg is going to

468
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,759
win that match significantly more times

469
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:14,719
than he isn't is what it feels like yeah

470
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,919
i forgot which trials it was was it four

471
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,278
years ago

472
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,278
where

473
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:20,240
kyle dake threw him

474
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,679
like he

475
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,680
he no you saw inklings of like yeah oh

476
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,799
wow there might be a eventually a

477
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:31,599
changing of the guard yeah so 13 kyle

478
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:32,958
came out and he had the one throw

479
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,480
but then he lost one of the matches

480
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,679
decisively

481
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,480
um and then he was hurt in 14

482
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,039
and in 16 kyle dick actually went up 86

483
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,759
kilograms so in actually in 16

484
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:47,519
at the trials we had um so j kerber was

485
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,278
number one seed he was former as guy

486
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,679
russell i was a former world silver

487
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,198
medalist so you had uh david taylor who

488
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,198
had not made a team yet who is now world

489
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:57,439
champion olympic champion you had kyle

490
00:15:55,198 --> 00:15:59,838
dake in the bracket who was a two-time

491
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,040
world champion now and you had jaden cox

492
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,279
in the bracket who had not made any

493
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:05,198
teams yet but is now what a four-time

494
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:06,879
world medals two-time world champion so

495
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,479
and then obviously jayden came out on

496
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,519
top of that won his first olympic medal

497
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:14,639
big bronze medal um so kyle didn't

498
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,240
wrestle jordan in 16 and jorda and

499
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,159
kyle's contention

500
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,759
the whole time

501
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,278
and they argued about this so i actually

502
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,720
did a little bit of backstabbing well it

503
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,159
was not it's not acceptable and both of

504
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,320
them were just one i didn't tell any of

505
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,278
them okay okay so jordan got mad so we

506
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,040
thought we talked about this fake

507
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,159
mastering chrono right we yeah we had to

508
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,240
make we had to make up something to talk

509
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:34,319
about yes there's obviously no matches

510
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,759
so we talked about this fake match and

511
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,519
do you stand behind that statement by

512
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,959
the way let's here's here's what i said

513
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,198
kyle kyle takes four times state

514
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,879
champion yes i said you got to pick a

515
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,278
you got to pick a winner i said kyle

516
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,720
dick wins 2-1 on a minute and six ride

517
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,360
time which i mean is literally we're

518
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,879
talking yeah as close as it gets as

519
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,360
close as it gets for kyle jake who's a

520
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,799
four-time ncaa champion i'm sorry

521
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,480
sorry we're talking over jordan

522
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,319
burroughs over jordan borrows inner

523
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,680
folks in a folk style match the

524
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,519
hypothetical college or not

525
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:03,359
hypothetically now or in college in

526
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,798
college both of them at their peaks at

527
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,880
165 pounds so completely hypothetical

528
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:09,838
and so jordan called in he was all

529
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,160
pissed

530
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,918
at me for picking kyle dick he wants to

531
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,519
come on the next day and argue his point

532
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,120
yeah so i said

533
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,160
f that that's that's dumb we need to

534
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,239
pick a winner way to do something

535
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,439
hypothetical so that i called caldegra i

536
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,359
said kyle jordan's gonna come on and

537
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,880
argue his case in the morning if he's

538
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,159
gonna do that why don't you come in and

539
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,640
argue your case

540
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,360
so no one else knew kyle was coming on

541
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,799
the block yeah so they both show up and

542
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,879
they went at it but one of the

543
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:36,879
contentions kyle had for years and

544
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,799
there's still this rule if you win a

545
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,799
world level medal

546
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,960
the following year

547
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:44,558
you sit out until the very end of the

548
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,558
american trials

549
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:48,879
and they do they do a best two or three

550
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:50,798
so every time previously that kyle had

551
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,120
wrestled jordan he had to come through a

552
00:17:50,798 --> 00:17:55,038
tournament on saturday yeah okay

553
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,038
probably three matches and then on

554
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,720
sunday he would wrestle jordan invest

555
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,558
two out of three right so his contention

556
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,919
was i'm only wrestling jordan at a

557
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,839
disadvantage because i have to compete

558
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,160
on saturday and then competing on which

559
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:08,319
it's a fair argument it really is but

560
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,160
i also see usa wrestling's point is like

561
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,678
if someone wins a world medal we are

562
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
going to reward them because we want

563
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,919
that person on the team again so it's

564
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,359
crazy though that you're like kyle jake

565
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,559
had to wrestle because he's not

566
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,359
wrestling bums in that box yeah and and

567
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,720
then

568
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,558
yeah i don't know i don't know how

569
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,360
wrestlers do it because

570
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,240
yeah

571
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,319
you have to go to war like three matches

572
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,919
and then face jordan borrows yeah

573
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:33,519
especially a few of those years with you

574
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,440
know daycad uh

575
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,279
the name andrew howe but it was a really

576
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,798
competitive match as david taylor had

577
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,639
really competitive match with him isaiah

578
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,079
martinez even got in there dearinger so

579
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,000
he had some really competitive matches

580
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,359
before he ever got to uh jordan

581
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,759
burroughs so i never answered your

582
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:48,558
initial question was uh how did i feel

583
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:51,279
so

584
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,480
the jordan burroughs match i was not in

585
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,839
wrestling shape at all meaning

586
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,120
wrestling's heavily dependent especially

587
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:57,279
neutral positions heavily dependent on

588
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:59,119
timing and other things i was wrestling

589
00:18:57,279 --> 00:19:00,558
very very minimally because i was i

590
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,599
started fighting again

591
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:05,200
so like my [ __ ] athletic shape was great

592
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:08,000
but it was mainly for fighting i wasn't

593
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,440
wrestling so um i think they were

594
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
actually trying to do

595
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,600
burroughs dig at the beat the streets

596
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,880
it's a big it's the biggest fundraiser

597
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:17,119
in wrestling every single year in new

598
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,960
york in new york city they usually raise

599
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,479
like a million dollars they started all

600
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,840
these programs in new york city to get

601
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
which that i really wonder what they're

602
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,000
doing the money now because they

603
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,679
probably can't have the kids wrestling

604
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,359
because new york is crazy

605
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,120
anyway i think new york figures out a

606
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,879
way what to do with the money hence

607
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:32,558
michael mouse complaining that they're

608
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,240
corrupt and all well go but it goes to

609
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,678
the beat the streets organization who

610
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,640
then starts the clubs in new york so i

611
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,600
don't know what to do

612
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:41,679
anyway so i was called like i don't know

613
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:44,000
two two weeks before the vet and said

614
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,640
hey you know someone saw us to wrestle

615
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,079
jordan burroughs it fell out

616
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,080
would you wrestle him

617
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:51,038
i said yeah sure why not you know and

618
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:52,960
it's like

619
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:53,919
well listen i i've i trained with them

620
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,919
for

621
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,280
four days the year before i had a pretty

622
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,200
good idea how the match was going to go

623
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,639
it wasn't going to go so well for me but

624
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,400
it's like okay you're missing a main

625
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,000
event i can bring because of where i'm

626
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,440
at right now in my life i can bring a

627
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,038
lot of attention to wrestling i can help

628
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,400
you guys raise a bunch of money for beat

629
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,158
the streets

630
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,400
my goal is i think i thought i could get

631
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,880
one takedown or turn on him was kind of

632
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:17,280
my goal for the match i didn't get there

633
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,039
uh it was kind of hard he went hard yeah

634
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,678
that [ __ ] can give me a point yeah

635
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,720
that i said this is [ __ ] jordan i

636
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,559
told him through the match like this is

637
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:26,159
[ __ ] you're [ __ ] going too hard

638
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:27,678
right now yeah i'm not a wrestler i'm

639
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,760
not a wrestler i'm a fighter i'm coming

640
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,759
in here so yeah so i i had a really good

641
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:34,079
idea i mean we wrestled together i think

642
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,319
in it he'll probably get mad because i

643
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:37,678
think in the live go we did like the 12

644
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:39,599
or 15 minutes i think i actually scored

645
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,280
a takedown in that i believe maybe or

646
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,319
maybe it was a turn he'll probably say

647
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:46,399
no i didn't but whatever um yeah so i i

648
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:48,240
knew what was gonna happen i i knew what

649
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,919
the outcome was going to be i knew i

650
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,359
could hope i could stay competitive and

651
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,799
maybe you know lose like 10-2 or

652
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,599
something like

653
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:56,319
yeah

654
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,240
well let's walk back because i think uh

655
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:01,038
i originally brought it up in terms of

656
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:03,679
how prepared were you against uh jake

657
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:07,200
paul versus uh jordan barros yeah so did

658
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:09,759
you prepare for jake cardio wise

659
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,319
yeah i worked hard yes yeah i did but it

660
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,158
was i told you i

661
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:16,639
started training for my i mean once once

662
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,000
i had my hip surgery yeah they said uh

663
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,520
you know for the first six weeks you

664
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,720
can't even walk

665
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,918
and it was hard for me to listen to him

666
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,839
because by week

667
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,720
four and a half five i was feeling

668
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:26,480
pretty good i want to give her my

669
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,319
crutches but i'm like you know what this

670
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,679
is for the rest of my life

671
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,439
and if you get the so if you get the

672
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,200
real hip replacement there's no

673
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,120
wrestling there's no nothing right so

674
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,640
that's the next step so okay i'm going

675
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,839
to take this here so i do my crutches in

676
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,480
six weeks the next six weeks it's still

677
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,480
like really low weight-bearing can't yes

678
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,079
do anything you know so then i get done

679
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,400
with the three months which is like

680
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:49,839
january and i'm like okay i should start

681
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,200
working out so i started riding a bike a

682
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,199
little bit and then

683
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,240
okay i'm now i'm fat i'm [ __ ] fat i'm

684
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,679
gonna get in better shape because i

685
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,480
don't do anything so i'm actually start

686
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,400
working out and uh and then that

687
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,159
happened right so i'm like okay well now

688
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,519
i got three months and

689
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,720
it gives me a good reason to get back in

690
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:06,319
shape and

691
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,919
um

692
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,439
you know i knew i wasn't going to be a

693
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:12,080
full-time boxer so it's like how do i

694
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,320
put a boxing camp together so i found

695
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,158
you know i had my ultimate mike rhodes

696
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,240
he came up and kind of

697
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,880
lived with me ish kind of thing for

698
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,839
three months uh i found a couple of this

699
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,679
guy k9 out of michigan he came over for

700
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:27,359
three weeks he was great i went to

701
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,519
freddie roach for a week so i kind of

702
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,759
like you know trying to get as many good

703
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,000
as ideas as i could and my thought was

704
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:35,919
like okay well if this dude sucks

705
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,359
i can just be tough and you know block a

706
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,919
few punches get him tired and then beat

707
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:41,119
him up if he's good that's probably not

708
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,799
much of my do about in the next three

709
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,479
months because i'm i'm i was never good

710
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:46,400
at boxing in the first place all of my

711
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,400
stand up in mixed martial arts was

712
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,440
predicated on how do i get through the

713
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,120
two or three punches that are going to

714
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,200
come at me in the time i need to get a

715
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,719
hold of them you know it's all you only

716
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,080
have to make two or three of them miss

717
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,120
and then boom you're on top of them at

718
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,720
least for me

719
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:00,399
um that was all my striking was

720
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,679
predicated on it wasn't about hey i'm

721
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,960
gonna do damage on the feet in order to

722
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,559
make something else happen it was like

723
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,440
how do i clear this

724
00:23:04,558 --> 00:23:08,720
barrier get a hold of you and if you i

725
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,798
actually did the math one time i think i

726
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,558
got a takedown

727
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,960
if you include the knockout round

728
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,480
against miles vidal i got to take down

729
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,720
every round except two so it was like it

730
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,880
was like 53 out of 55 rounds in mma i

731
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,480
gotta take down wow somewhere somewhere

732
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,039
in there okay so you're hunting the

733
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,558
takedown once you once right away once

734
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,400
you get get uh

735
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:29,279
your hands on them you get to take down

736
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
yeah

737
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,798
okay

738
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,360
but the incredible thing about you

739
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,918
i i just uh recently talked

740
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:38,719
spent a couple days with jimmy pedro

741
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,320
and

742
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,278
he talked about

743
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:45,119
his guys and just champions in general

744
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,480
hating to lose more than they love

745
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:49,278
winning

746
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,278
and the way you talked about losing you

747
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:54,079
lost very few times in your career like

748
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,440
later you you were dominating both

749
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:57,839
wrestling and

750
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:59,919
mma but the way you took these losses

751
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,038
against people that are

752
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,960
i don't know

753
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,400
below elite level

754
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,159
it's fair uh

755
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,840
i was gonna get pissy but enough but

756
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,760
it's completely fair

757
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:12,079
i thought he was a bum too no that's not

758
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:14,960
what i meant i'm in trouble it's okay no

759
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,720
it's good no no um no no but like what

760
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,798
can you explain the psychology behind

761
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:21,120
that like the what

762
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,278
is is there uh a system behind this is

763
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,119
there philosophy behind this well i i

764
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:26,960
wasn't very good

765
00:24:25,119 --> 00:24:28,158
in the beginning and i think i think

766
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,400
that's where all starts from so i didn't

767
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,799
start getting good until the age of like

768
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,440
13. i started at five i probably started

769
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,200
competing more at age 10 11.

770
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,400
i didn't really get good until 13 it's

771
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,720
still at 13 i'm i'm i'm great i'm

772
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,720
getting better right i'm pretty good um

773
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,798
so actually i've actually i have writing

774
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,558
this book on sports psych but this it's

775
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,158
i got well i got someone right for me

776
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,000
kind of thing uh because i've had this

777
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,440
philosophy for years that there's there

778
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,599
has to be this balance between two

779
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,400
things right so on the one hand in this

780
00:24:55,599 --> 00:25:00,558
category on the one hand you have hating

781
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,400
to lose a great champion has to hate to

782
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,399
lose like you said right but on this

783
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,759
other hand you have to have

784
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,798
someone who seeks out challenges right

785
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:10,000
because if you don't have that you're

786
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,679
never gonna reach your full potential

787
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,880
either and so you have to balance these

788
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,120
two balls

789
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,679
at the same time right and so like for

790
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,439
me i always and this is maybe because i

791
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,038
wasn't good but i was always like let me

792
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,640
go find the best people to wrestle all

793
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,879
the time let me go find i would like

794
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,799
literally uh like seven days great when

795
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,799
i was starting to get better it was like

796
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,240
end decision internet well there was no

797
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:31,839
one was using the internet it was like a

798
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,519
wrestling magazine like hey dad there's

799
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:35,278

800
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:37,679
kids can be there can you take me two

801
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,679
hours across the state today please

802
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,440
you would wrestle like in competition

803
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,640
against them in competition yeah yeah in

804
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,640
competition hey i heard there's this

805
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,480
tournament here's the magazine says this

806
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,240
tournament hey dad will you take me over

807
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,278
there tomorrow you you weren't trying to

808
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,038
win you were trying to get the

809
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:52,880
experience i was trying to wrestle the

810
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,000
best guys maybe i win maybe i lose

811
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,159
there's no when you used to do a

812
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,599
competition there's no guarantee of a

813
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,840
win or a loss you're just doing

814
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,359
competition right so i wanted to go i

815
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:02,558
wanted to challenge myself against the

816
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,240
best guys

817
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:05,759
of which i thought maybe i could come

818
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,558
out on top right so like eighth grade

819
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:08,480
year

820
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:10,558
i won way way you know i probably lost a

821
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,759
handful of times in the state of well

822
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:12,879
state wisconsin was probably really

823
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,319
really minimal the amount of times i

824
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,400
lost you know but it was just about

825
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:18,079
getting the challenge and it's like some

826
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,600
some kids

827
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,960
and not kids in my club because i'll

828
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:23,119
push them very hard on this are scared

829
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:25,200
of challenging themselves they like

830
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:27,038
being the big fish in this small pond

831
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,640
they're not willing to go say i want to

832
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,319
go get that guy and i want to get that

833
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,440
guy and i want to get that guy and so

834
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,960
that's like

835
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,720
so i think that's part of it for me is

836
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,440
like i always just love the challenge i

837
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,798
enjoyed competing thoroughly right and i

838
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,400
understood from a young age because it

839
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:42,158
wasn't very good losing's a part of it

840
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,400
you're not always going to win and that

841
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,520
was kind of it it's like hey sometimes

842
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:49,360
you know and for my mma career

843
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,200
i never planned it to go that way but

844
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,038
yeah i didn't lose for nine years and

845
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,880
like that's that's pretty rare i didn't

846
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,440
plan for that to happen that was just

847
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,679
what happened okay but you also

848
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:02,240
didn't lose like the second part of your

849
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,880
college career my 87 i lost i won my

850
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,120
last 87 matches yeah

851
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,960
so that didn't come along with the

852
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:11,278
hatred of losing you just i don't like

853
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,480
losing i still don't like it yeah

854
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:14,880
yeah

855
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,558
okay but you're you don't

856
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,320
uh you don't seem to you you seem to

857
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:20,079
kind of shrug it off a little bit okay

858
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,359
so like but specifically with these two

859
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,639
instances that you bring up with the

860
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:25,439
mosfet all

861
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,720
right it feels definitely so okay

862
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,720
all right let's go let's go deep let's

863
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,679
go all right so the mosfet one it feels

864
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:34,240
different because um

865
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,480
let's for people don't know okay uh moz

866
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,960
vidal loss was your first loss first

867
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,919
last city in mma yes yeah yeah i think

868
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,399
yeah and i mean it was a dramatic loss

869
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:47,120
and there was this kind of build up as

870
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:50,798
you or potentially one of the greats of

871
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:51,678
all time coming into this fight

872
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,319
and so

873
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,159
there's pressure all of that so the no i

874
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,398
mean i i was thoroughly enjoying it i

875
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:01,278
don't i didn't feel the pressure so the

876
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:03,278
mazda fight is

877
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:05,519
he got one [ __ ] move on me it's not

878
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:08,079
he beat me and if we do that again i

879
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:09,918
think i win at that point in my life for

880
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,639
sure i think i win

881
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,759
way way way more times than i lose he he

882
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,038
knew that too that's why he didn't what

883
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:16,158
he didn't want something sounded about

884
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:17,278
agreement that's why i had to taunt him

885
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,880
and why he got so mad because i had to

886
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,679
continue to taunt him in order to get

887
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,760
him to sign right um so that one hurt

888
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,440
because uh and some people don't know my

889
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,519
materials go through it fast i did three

890
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,679
fights in like uh smaller leagues i got

891
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,398
signed by bellator i was undefeated for

892
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,360
three and a half years i was 9-0

893
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,639
when i got done with that in 2012

894
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:37,839
2013

895
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,679
um

896
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,359
i at that point in my head i was just

897
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,038
gonna transition to the ufc because

898
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,879
that's where you go i was ranked like

899
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,480
six in the world i

900
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,600
hadn't really had a competitive match at

901
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,440
the end of the bellator thing and dana

902
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,798
white for a reason still unknown to me

903
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,399
we still haven't had this conversation i

904
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,519
wish i could ask i should ask him some

905
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:58,479
time

906
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:01,359
chose to refuse me any entry in dfc he

907
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,200
just said i went to his office

908
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,398
and he literally said we're not

909
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,558
interested we're not going to make you

910
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:09,038
an offer did you did you mention

911
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,720
something to about him about the ufc

912
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,720
that was a year before that that was the

913
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,200
year before that that that might play a

914
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,360
role in it i think so uh yes what

915
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,759
happened the year before that was

916
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:21,278
uh i called him a liar which but listen

917
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,519
i'm right on this one because he said

918
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:25,359
you can't test for drugs because i'm i'm

919
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,398
all natural which you can tell by my

920
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:30,479
physique um and i was always put off by

921
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,278
the fact that so many people cheated

922
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,120
and i i was very vocal about that and so

923
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:36,240
he had made some statement like oh

924
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,158
there's no way you could test i said

925
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,240
[ __ ] you you very specifically i

926
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,919
said usada does it for all other sports

927
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,440
worldwide

928
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,640
you can do it and then it's funny

929
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,080
because i hired you sat a couple years

930
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,759
later yeah so i think he took some

931
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:48,720
offense to that but that was like a year

932
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:50,000
and

933
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,600
almost a year and a half i think

934
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,278
somewhere later

935
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,119
um it's not like he holds a grudge or

936
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:55,919
anything

937
00:29:55,119 --> 00:30:00,079
yeah

938
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,278
so i so i i literally go to vegas um

939
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,199
it's a long story you can read about it

940
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:04,798
other places i i so i got released from

941
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,240
about it's not like this is negotiation

942
00:30:04,798 --> 00:30:07,759
i got released from my bellator contract

943
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,038
i said i'm out of here i'm going i'm

944
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:13,440
going to go to the uc i go to vegas and

945
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,158
then i was told hey there's no offer for

946
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,038
you

947
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:19,278
tough [ __ ] you know so then

948
00:30:17,038 --> 00:30:21,278
i ended up signing with one championship

949
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,798
i spent what three and a half years

950
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,839
there i won the belt in my second fight

951
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:27,918
and retained the title the entire time

952
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,678
and then i just again dominating people

953
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,960
yeah i didn't have a competitive fight

954
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,159
and so um i retired 18-0 never never

955
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,360
again and for someone who loves a

956
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,880
challenge never getting to really

957
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,278
challenge myself was incredibly

958
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,960
frustrating and i left the door open but

959
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,839
i said if i ever get the chance to prove

960
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,159
them this world i'd love to come back so

961
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:47,599
somehow a year later i get traded trades

962
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,440
never happened and this is the one and

963
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,959
only trade ever

964
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,960
i i've been retired for a year i got

965
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,399
traded i get to come back i fight robbie

966
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,240
lawler the first fight

967
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:58,798
i win and then essentially they're

968
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,000
saying okay if you fight uh you know if

969
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,839
you beat george you're gonna get the

970
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,119
title [ __ ] against marty and

971
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:06,240
um it's like this this is what i've been

972
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,599
working for the entire i've been trying

973
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,359
to prove the best part of the world for

974
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,119
the last 10 years and i've not been

975
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:12,240
afforded this opportunity

976
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,158
um

977
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,880
so when i lost to george that was hard

978
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,360
because i it was is something that

979
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,880
i had waited for for a really really

980
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,158
long time it was something that i you

981
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,519
know i thought i could compete for and i

982
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,240
never got the opportunity to do that one

983
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,159
was hard um at the same time from like

984
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,599
just the competitive logistics like he

985
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,360
got me with one move it wasn't like he

986
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,278
beat my ass for 15 minutes and i got

987
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,959
beat a bunch of different ways

988
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:36,480
so that was like

989
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,679
[ __ ] like if i get it again i could have

990
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,960
done it but i'm not i'm not they're not

991
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,240
gonna let me have it again it's not like

992
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,919
wrestling where you could go the next

993
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,278
year or the next week or whatever you

994
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,799
know you lose the big tens you go to

995
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:46,640
nationals two weeks later

996
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,038
does that loss change you

997
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,360
in any way your psychology i don't i

998
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,200
don't think so it's the first loss

999
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,158
i mean had i had i

1000
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,278
had a longer mma career post that yeah

1001
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,799
there definitely would have been a lot

1002
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:00,640
of time spent

1003
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,079
getting better at the end the entry

1004
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,240
point to the takedown right which i

1005
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,158
already spent time there um i don't i

1006
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,319
and i hate making excuses but yeah the

1007
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,799
the hip the hinging of my hip what i

1008
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:12,398
couldn't do was preventing me from doing

1009
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,000
some things and it's why if you look at

1010
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:15,278
the fight i'm like bent over as they go

1011
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,640
for the double leg

1012
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:18,720
yeah so what happened for people who

1013
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,919
don't know you went in for a double leg

1014
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,759
and he went

1015
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,360
he did a flying knee and then and and

1016
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:25,038
the weight caught you well specifically

1017
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,479
the way he did that knee was kind of

1018
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,278
different than the way anyone had thrown

1019
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,880
flying knees before most people go more

1020
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,119
just from a stand straight vertical

1021
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,519
whereas he took a few like running steps

1022
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,759
and went more you know the trajectory of

1023
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,599
the angle was different um so i think

1024
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:40,480
that's kind of probably why it caught

1025
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:42,480
you know

1026
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,839
i think a lot of things in combat well

1027
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,038
probably everything but i focus

1028
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:46,959
specifically on compass happen

1029
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:49,359
subconsciously like our brain is reading

1030
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,120
what's coming at us and and a lot of

1031
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:53,678
times it's stuff we've seen before so we

1032
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:55,119
can judge how to move correctly misread

1033
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,798
because it's something you haven't seen

1034
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,959
head for had not seen him come at that

1035
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,519
specific angle yeah so that also was

1036
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,200
really hard with the burrows one

1037
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,159
i told you i knew i was going to lose so

1038
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,159
it was like

1039
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,000
whatever you know i'm taking this

1040
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:09,600
because i want to put the sport of

1041
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,960
wrestling out there in a big way i want

1042
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,879
to help them raise a lot of money we

1043
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,159
sold at madison square garden hoo

1044
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,399
theater and we raised a whole bunch of

1045
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,240
money so my goals were accomplished jake

1046
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:19,278
paul fight i took it because they paid

1047
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,960
me a bunch of money and i thought it was

1048
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:22,640
gonna be fun did i have any illusion i

1049
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,120
was a great boxer no illusions

1050
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,360
whatsoever would i have preferred to win

1051
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,639
absolutely but you know like i told

1052
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,678
everyone whether i win or lose on

1053
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,120
saturday night i'm gonna be back

1054
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,880
coaching wrestling on monday because

1055
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,719
that's what i enjoy doing and i was back

1056
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,000
coaching wrestling on monday and once a

1057
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,399
month these middle school kids give me a

1058
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,200
little bit [ __ ] about it and that's it

1059
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:40,558
but

1060
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,120
where were you

1061
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,798
in terms of your shape and how you felt

1062
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,558
in the mazda doll fight

1063
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:49,278
would you say you're on the i mean it's

1064
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,519
a difficult question to ask of

1065
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,880
of a world-class athlete but like were

1066
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,399
you

1067
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,600
past peak

1068
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,798
oh yeah yeah

1069
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,480
that's i don't know i don't know why

1070
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,879
guys like to lie about that i mean the

1071
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,960
peak for me was really evidently in my

1072
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,679
late 20s um

1073
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,679
and maybe they are all fueled by

1074
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:10,000
extra supplements i i don't know but for

1075
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,480
me that was evident but you get this so

1076
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,639
you get this crosshair where

1077
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,159
um you're if you're smart like you know

1078
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,679
like i mentioned john bros was you're

1079
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,679
still gaining wisdom you're gaining

1080
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,440
strategy gaining a lot of things right

1081
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,760
and so while your physicality may go

1082
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,679
down your overall skill level still may

1083
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,919
be rising especially in mma because

1084
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,760
people usually start later

1085
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,279
because they're gaining wisdom strategy

1086
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,560
all the maybe more tools in their

1087
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:35,280
toolbox right they're getting all these

1088
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:36,960
things so their actual competitive peak

1089
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,480
despite their athletic peak going down

1090
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,918
might still be

1091
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,240
a few years past that right because

1092
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,679
these things are crossing um no so i

1093
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,358
thought i was i was great obviously the

1094
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,280
hip was an issue

1095
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:49,358
um

1096
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,519
it's funny because so that

1097
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:53,279
i knew i had a lot of pain here and i

1098
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:54,559
knew it was because of this it was like

1099
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,079
okay whenever i'm done i'll just get it

1100
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:58,078
taken care of whatever

1101
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,079
uh but i every time i train i have pain

1102
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:02,960
kind of like all up my back

1103
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:04,960
and the day after the surgery i woke up

1104
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,400
and there was no pain on the right side

1105
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,760
of my surgery on the left side there's

1106
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,519
no pain in the right side of my back

1107
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,800
that's [ __ ] weird like every every

1108
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:13,759
morning i wake up there's a lot of pain

1109
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,359
there you know um i'm like okay i'm on

1110
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,200
pain pills maybe it'll maybe it'll come

1111
00:35:15,358 --> 00:35:19,039
back tomorrow and this that's never

1112
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:21,118
never been back since

1113
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,199
so it's weird because it was like this

1114
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,599
i thought this was affecting this but it

1115
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,358
was affecting all the way across my

1116
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,400
whole back so you know if i get to get a

1117
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,440
new hip honestly if i if i

1118
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,519
i don't know it's going to change the

1119
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,880
competitive outcome whatsoever

1120
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,480
if i had known how good the hip

1121
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,000
replacement was going to be

1122
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,760
i would have done it the second i

1123
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,400
retired from one championship in

1124
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,800
november of 2017 i would have my hip

1125
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,559
surgery scheduled for december 1. just

1126
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,320
from a lifestyle standpoint i could only

1127
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:49,599
sleep in one position

1128
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,519
there's a lot of things i couldn't do i

1129
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,519
was in a lot of pain um so i would have

1130
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:56,079
done that a lot earlier but no from my

1131
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:58,400
athletic point i was ready just chit

1132
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:00,000
goes wrong sometimes

1133
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,200
i don't know how to ask this but you

1134
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,920
know joe rogan me

1135
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,078
had a had a sense about you similar to

1136
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,000
like uh fedor

1137
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:13,440
that you are potentially one of the

1138
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,599
greatest ever yeah does it hurt that

1139
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:17,760
you're not in the discussion now of

1140
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,559
being in the top 10

1141
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,880
yeah of all time i didn't prove it i

1142
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:24,559
don't deserve it

1143
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,280
i mean but i didn't i didn't prove it i

1144
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:29,599
mean and so it's like uh

1145
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,359
had i had i somehow gotten to convince

1146
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,039
dana white we go and convince him in

1147
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,400
2013 to

1148
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:36,159
make me an offer and i didn't even need

1149
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,838
a good offer i needed any offer had i

1150
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,000
gotten the offer then

1151
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:41,920
maybe the outcome's different right but

1152
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:44,320
given i would never expect anyone to

1153
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,320
think of me that way i didn't prove it i

1154
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,920
know i know what i was

1155
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,200
and i'm good with that and yeah other

1156
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,960
people never got to see that do you

1157
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:54,399
think well you don't know you can't know

1158
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,079
fully right do you think if you uh went

1159
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,358
to the ufc at that time instead of one

1160
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,039
championship i think it would have a lot

1161
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:00,639
of success

1162
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,000
yeah i mean there's obviously certain

1163
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:03,039
guys there's a lot of guys i've trained

1164
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,960
with that

1165
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:06,480
i had a lot of really good results

1166
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,240
against and

1167
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:10,320
um

1168
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:12,000
walter wait at that time tyron was a

1169
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,680
champion for a long time there

1170
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,119
so i was around tyler was a champion

1171
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,358
anthony was a champion at lightweight i

1172
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:19,200
was you know the same gym as him and we

1173
00:37:17,358 --> 00:37:21,519
had a lot of people coming through

1174
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:23,279
yeah did you face turn

1175
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,719
would i have fought him i don't think so

1176
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,280
i mean so he was still the champion when

1177
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:29,039
i came into the dfc and we said no we're

1178
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,480
not going to fight

1179
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:32,480
all right

1180
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,320
hey so he can't change history right so

1181
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,679
once something happens you got to accept

1182
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,760
for what it is and

1183
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:39,279
move forward and and obviously hope you

1184
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,720
can continue to keep accomplishing great

1185
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,320
things which for me obviously my

1186
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,159
athletic career is over

1187
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,160
so now it's going to be through my

1188
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:48,239
wrestling academies and you know who

1189
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:49,598
knows what else i could get into oh you

1190
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:51,838

1192
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,559
of stuff right statue wrestling and

1193
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:58,000
stuff no uh i don't think so so here's

1194
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,440
my thing with the wrestling matches is

1195
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,960

00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,358
lessons i have such thing about the

1206
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,639
development of the athletes sometimes i

1207
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,719
can wrestle hard but most of the time

1208
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,000
it's like i'm just gonna help them with

1209
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,439
whatever they need help with and it's

1210
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,358
still wrestling and it's fun but it's

1211
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,559
helping them you know for like for king

1212
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:32,159
jose this summer and he's trained for

1213
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,759
the general title so to be able to shake

1214
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,920
hands sometimes and say like i'm gonna

1215
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,680
try to kick your ass she try to kick my

1216
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,680
ass you know like just to go like yeah

1217
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,039
it's a good feeling it's so much fun and

1218
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:42,078
i don't get to do that very much so if

1219
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:44,159
you said ben would you love do some

1220
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,560
matches and the answer is yeah

1221
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,480
the problem unfortunately for me and

1222
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,239
maybe you could talk me off a ledge here

1223
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,679
is like because of where i've gotten to

1224
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:52,799
my career if i choose to do wrestling

1225
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,919
match it it's going to people are going

1226
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,760
to be really excited about it's going to

1227
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,200
blow up and it's like

1228
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,119
i just want to wrestle just to wrestle

1229
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,559
i'd rather just like go in a room where

1230
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,559
no one can watch and just wrestle and

1231
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:04,880
just enjoy it well you could also

1232
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,078
wrestle so there's different kinds of

1233
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,838
wrestling there's wrestling when there's

1234
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,160
an event

1235
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:12,000
and like you know there's a build up and

1236
00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:15,519
then announcement yeah and you can also

1237
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,400
do like uh khabib style like in the room

1238
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:20,079
there's cameras and you're kind of going

1239
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,559
it's like the weeb does that

1240
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,560
no in uh marcel did that he whipped my

1241
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,480
ass a few times yeah exactly i mean i've

1242
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:28,639
seen could be some videos okay it's not

1243
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,358
like set up it's just people going hard

1244
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,400
and then it's more fun yeah you know and

1245
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:35,279
it's

1246
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:37,920
it's also more like

1247
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,760
presenting the beauty of the sport yeah

1248
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,079
you know for sure and like and there's

1249
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,920
no winning or losing really in that

1250
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,839
context yeah like you're just you're

1251
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,358
always joking around a little bit

1252
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:49,279
even when you're going super hard so i

1253
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:50,719
feel like especially in the modern day

1254
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,880
with with the internet that's a

1255
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,639
compelling way to do so i've thought

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,200
no nothing we just wrestle camera that's

1270
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:22,480
it right it's camera in the room maybe

1271
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:24,318
maybe maybe there's a referee because we

1272
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,199
don't want to be contention over the pen

1273
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,318
so one pin just one pin 30 minutes 30

1274
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:30,239
minutes okay

1275
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:32,639
if i pin you you don't get [ __ ] you go

1276
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:34,000
home right every person i pin it goes up

1277
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,440
by a thousand dollars two thousand three

1278
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,480
thousand four thousand five thousand and

1279
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:38,000
so on

1280
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,519
if you make it the distance and i don't

1281
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,679
pin you and you don't pin me i'll pay

1282
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,440
for your travel and give you 500 bucks

1283
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,480
right this the consolation prize for

1284
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,760
showing up

1285
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,480
if you pin me you get whatever the

1286
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,480
jackpot is

1287
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:52,960
wait who's adding to the jackpot i am

1288
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,559
it's my it's my money

1289
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,240
but then what's the incentive to keep

1290
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,440
winning for you because it's jackpots

1291
00:40:56,239 --> 00:40:59,039
well because i'm so i would put the

1292
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,480
content somewhere people would watch it

1293
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,440
oh you're gonna make money yeah so you

1294
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,800
would make money that way it's not

1295
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,960
exponentially growing right it's just

1296
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,920
going up by like yeah i really think

1297
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,440
there's probably only a couple people

1298
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,280
that could pin me so

1299
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,440
i would just not choose those people or

1300
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,800
wait till i get a really large audience

1301
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,880
and people get really excited in that

1302
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,400
case i'm making a lot of money so

1303
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,440
what do you think how many matches would

1304
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:21,280
go with you like call dick shows up i

1305
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,519
don't think he could hit me yeah but

1306
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,599
being like jordan jordan bros could beat

1307
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:27,440
me but he can't pin me he was never a

1308
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,280
pinner yeah he ain't gonna pin me

1309
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,440
there's only a few people who have the

1310
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,880
skill level to do so right it takes a

1311
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,039
lot because so pinning was one of my

1312
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,480
specialties i had the fourth most of all

1313
00:41:35,039 --> 00:41:37,519
time and i won the penny award the last

1314
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,400
two years

1315
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:39,838
um

1316
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,358
so and then even

1317
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:43,838
on points and just pin them this is

1318
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:46,000
actually one of the issues i have with

1319
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:47,519
jiu jitsu and the point system and the

1320
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,880
eddie bravo thing i actually think eddie

1321
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,440
bravo things kind of people get so mad

1322
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,318
at me sorry too i think it's [ __ ]

1323
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,240
and you want me to tell you why it's

1324
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:56,960
[ __ ] yeah so like if jordan brewer's

1325
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:59,199
whoops my ass and the score is 16 to two

1326
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,960
but he can't pin me then i get to go to

1327
00:41:59,199 --> 00:42:02,639
overtime and get a cradle on him i'm

1328
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,639
probably gonna pin him

1329
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,400
so i'm better than jordan burroughs

1330
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:08,559
nah they didn't right he just whipped my

1331
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,760
ass you know what i'm saying like if we

1332
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:11,519
can go the whole because they do

1333
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,680
submission only

1334
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:15,280
so if jordan bros beats me up

1335
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,199
for was it eight minutes ten minutes i

1336
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,359
don't know what's the length of an eddie

1337
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:21,358
bravo match yeah i don't know that's

1338
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:22,719
something like that yeah yeah so we go

1339
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,719
tell me john browser today he's gonna

1340
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:27,039
outscore me significantly he he will not

1341
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,039
pin me i promise you that okay

1342
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:31,279
so now we go we go to the overtime

1343
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,960
strong wars but yeah he won't jordan

1344
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,560
bros is not gonna he's gonna beat me i

1345
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,800
will give you that call day won't pin

1346
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,119
you either no okay okay they'll both

1347
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,318
beat me on points very badly now david

1348
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:42,640
taylor he might he might pin me because

1349
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,480
he's a very good pinner also um they'll

1350
00:42:42,639 --> 00:42:46,480
beat me very badly they will not pin me

1351
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:48,719
um but now we get to overtime and we get

1352
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,199
to pick like uh right so in a bravo you

1353
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:53,118
get a rear naked choke or an arm bar

1354
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,519
okay give me a cradle i'll probably pin

1355
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:57,039
them okay a good cradle you can say

1356
00:42:55,519 --> 00:42:58,400
cradle or maybe give them they're not

1357
00:42:57,039 --> 00:43:00,000
probably not going to pin me right maybe

1358
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,280
maybe there's a chance but probably not

1359
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,119
because this is not their special day so

1360
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,359
for people who don't know the eddie uh

1361
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:07,920
eddie bravo thing is uh

1362
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:10,078
when it goes into overtime you get a

1363
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,680
dominance position on a person and you

1364
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,039
get to yeah basically put them in a

1365
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:15,440
cradle this is the wrestling equivalent

1366
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:17,599
yeah but you uh take their back maybe

1367
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,720
yeah like a wrestling arm bar yeah and i

1368
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,160
don't think that's very fair because if

1369
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:22,399
someone whoops your ass they whip your

1370
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,399
ass and then you know and so i think the

1371
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,400
reason why jujitsu people accept that

1372
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,760
rule set is that i don't think

1373
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,880
i think they know this but would admit

1374
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,880
it i don't think they're their point

1375
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:33,920
scoring system ad include adding

1376
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,318
adequately rewards what people value so

1377
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,079
like in wrestling we value takedowns

1378
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,639
because it gets closer to the pin and

1379
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:42,960
the most valuable scoring is a near

1380
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:45,039
fault near to the pin because that's the

1381
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,199
ultimate goal to sport whereas in jiu

1382
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:49,519
jitsu for example like if i were to get

1383
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,439
a takedown uh so like if i went to

1384
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:54,000
gordon ryan and he just didn't pull

1385
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:56,159
guard i would probably get the takedown

1386
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,679
now if somehow he didn't submit me which

1387
00:43:56,159 --> 00:43:59,279
he probably would right but say he got

1388
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,598
got close to like 12 submissions but

1389
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:03,760
somehow i slipped out of all of them

1390
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:05,200
now i win 2-0 like that's ridiculous

1391
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,319
like he should very clearly win because

1392
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:07,439
he almost submitted you know what i'm

1393
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:08,960
saying like

1394
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:10,880
there and i and i realized the

1395
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,920
difficulty i realized the difficulty in

1396
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:15,680
rewarding near submissions but that is

1397
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,599
the most valuable thing is getting close

1398
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,358
to finishing the match and in most

1399
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,079
competitions they don't actually reward

1400
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:22,318
that

1401
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:24,640
but okay so this isn't about the sport

1402
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:25,920
this is about the ben askren challenge

1403
00:44:24,639 --> 00:44:28,559
that we're talking about

1404
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,920
okay what why 30 minutes why not

1405
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:30,960
unlimited time

1406
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:33,519
hmm

1407
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,119
why do i go until whenever well because

1408
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,119
then it's just a cardio thing because at

1409
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:38,160
some point um

1410
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,920
then someone would just have to fall

1411
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,920
over dead right there's no more skill

1412
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:45,119
level involved it's just who can stand

1413
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:47,680
up the longest you honestly don't think

1414
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,200
30 minutes is a cardio thing too how do

1415
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:50,879
you think that's actually going to look

1416
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,318
kyle day going against you for 30

1417
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,000
minutes so it's going to be kind of

1418
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:56,318
boring um

1419
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,679
for the most part

1420
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,440
what position are you going to be

1421
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:00,960
because you well you can but you can't

1422
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,358
you just can't have a gigantic amount of

1423
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,880
action for 30 minutes so i i relate to

1424
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:06,960
because some of my kids when when

1425
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,838
teaching them wrestling they're like

1426
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,720
well

1427
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:10,559
but

1428
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,399
i can't do that for seven minutes and

1429
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:13,358
i'm like well you know like say if i had

1430
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,160
you do

1431
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:15,920
uh

1432
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:17,039
hang cleans at a relatively heavy weight

1433
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,800
as hard as you could you're not gonna

1434
00:45:17,039 --> 00:45:21,199
last seven minutes you're gonna your

1435
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,640
pace will slow down right so my thing is

1436
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,519
like well your pace doesn't have to step

1437
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:25,759
here because i'm wrestling you're

1438
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,838
competing at someone so if you're here

1439
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,920
at 100 and you go to 80 but they go to

1440
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:32,480
70 that's great and then you go to 60

1441
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,639
but they go to 40. this is even better

1442
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:36,240
right because the gap is growing so we

1443
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,000
don't necessarily if we get tired that's

1444
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,078
fine if they get more tired that's

1445
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,440
better so i think most people would know

1446
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,720
that so they would

1447
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,720
kind of slow it down

1448
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:48,000
but yeah i think it's third a third i

1449
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,519
mean i've wrestled 30 minute goes i've

1450
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,079
wrestled six months i've wrestled hour

1451
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:53,440
long goes um you're not gonna get so

1452
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,200
tired you're gonna fall over in that

1453
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,358
time period but at some point if it's

1454
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,039
unlimited someone will get so tired that

1455
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:02,559
or dehydrated that they're just gonna

1456
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,239
freaking fall over yeah but you think

1457
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:06,159
what about making it exciting and

1458
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:08,078
dynamic

1459
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:09,679
you think the other person is always

1460
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,760
going to be going for the pin

1461
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:12,960
and thereby make a dynamic well if

1462
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,280
they're working that hard then they

1463
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,039
might exhaust themselves right right and

1464
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,960
and obviously then if you're if you're

1465
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:21,119
being that dynamic then you're adding

1466
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,599
risk to yourself too because you are you

1467
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,599
know doing that well i love this this is

1468
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,519
a great idea

1469
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,680
well i figured i'd get i rack up like 20

1470
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,039
pins against bums you know or not not as

1471
00:46:29,679 --> 00:46:32,799
great people in the beginning and then i

1472
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:34,318
would start bringing in better people

1473
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,839
because they would be enticed by you

1474
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,599
know twenty thousand dollars the

1475
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,838
possibility to win and not not much

1476
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,599
fanfare just a camera and just chemical

1477
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,679
that's it in my wrestling room yeah yeah

1478
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,760
like the gracie challenge yes

1479
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:47,598
yeah may and so then maybe you have like

1480
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,359
um

1481
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,359
you know for most people you have

1482
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:53,039
someone edit like the 90 seconds of the

1483
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,719
most fun things that happen and then you

1484
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:56,480
can watch the entire 30 minutes if you

1485
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:58,879
want to yeah i mean i think most people

1486
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,358
if they're not really really elite um

1487
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,480
i'm probably gonna pin them

1488
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:04,480
if they're not really elite

1489
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:07,599
so yeah but i don't know i i that's

1490
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,078
something i've been thinking about this

1491
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,000
just been like fun for me to think about

1492
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,079
um and obviously it plays in my skill

1493
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:15,920
sets because my cardio is good and my

1494
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,240
opinion is good also

1495
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,559
so yeah so

1496
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:23,679
like you said you weren't very good in

1497
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,519
your early days until 13 14. what was

1498
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:26,960
the switch you became you started to

1499
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:28,719
dominate people

1500
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,079
in your college career you dominated

1501
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:32,799
yeah

1502
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:35,119
and uh obviously you stopped losing at

1503
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,800
some point yeah so

1504
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,160
uh well i would say so even when i

1505
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:39,680
didn't lose in collegiate competition i

1506
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:41,838
i would go in the summers and try to

1507
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:44,078
make the world team so i would lose some

1508
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,719
not a lot right minimally

1509
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:48,240
um okay so when i'm five i start playing

1510
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,159
all sports like

1511
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:51,358
i i know you moved to america at what

1512
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,199
age

1513
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:54,719
13 okay so fi so

1514
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:57,598
at least i don't know what it was for

1515
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,358
you but in america and my age you

1516
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,880
usually play like a sport every season

1517
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:04,000
right so that's what i did in the

1518
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:07,519
beginning um i had minimal success in

1519
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,280
wrestling i was kind of chunky and then

1520
00:48:07,519 --> 00:48:11,199
i'm in fifth grade i don't i and i can't

1521
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:12,800
i can't tell you i i want to be better

1522
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:14,078
and i told my parents that it is funny

1523
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,839
because now i look at other 11 year olds

1524
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:17,200
and very few of them are this mature and

1525
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:18,799
i actually think emotional maturity is

1526
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:20,399
kind of one of the key indicators of how

1527
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,318
long term successful someone's going to

1528
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,838
be in age 11 i said i don't want to play

1529
00:48:22,318 --> 00:48:24,639
baseball and i like baseball but i don't

1530
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:25,599
want to play this because i want to

1531
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:26,639
wrestle more so i'll get better

1532
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,640
wrestling

1533
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:30,480
so age 11 i quit baseball so i could

1534
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,759
wrestle in a club for march april and

1535
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,199
may because that was that was all that

1536
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,880
existed at that point in time you

1537
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:37,118
couldn't wrestle in june july or any of

1538
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:38,800
those other months um

1539
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,318
what was that desire to get better what

1540
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:42,160
is that so it's not about i don't know

1541
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:43,519
where it came from okay i just

1542
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:44,558
i want to get better i want to get back

1543
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,838
i want to be good at this i want to be

1544
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,079
really good at this so when you're

1545
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,078
looking at kids now as a coach you're

1546
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,440
looking for that somebody who says you

1547
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,519
know what i kind of suck i want to get

1548
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,720
better and and i want to try to also

1549
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:59,280
inspire that i mean honestly i think

1550
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:02,318
i think as a coach that's probably my my

1551
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,079
biggest job is to get a kid and get them

1552
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:07,279
to believe i can do this because if i

1553
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:09,280
can do this what can i i can do that i

1554
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:11,440
can do that too right and there's so

1555
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,319
many kids who unfortunately have like

1556
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,318
shitty parents or bad teachers that tell

1557
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,318
them you suck you can't be anything

1558
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:19,759
right so i think my biggest goal as a

1559
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:20,800
coach is to get someone to believe they

1560
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:22,480
can do it so actually some of the ones

1561
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,318
that believe they can do it they're the

1562
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,679
most fun but they're not the ones who

1563
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:27,199
need it the most right the ones who

1564
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:28,960
think they can are the ones that need me

1565
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,639
the most yeah because they need someone

1566
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,480
to let's go

1567
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:35,039
um so i don't i don't know

1568
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,920
what inspired me i'm not sure so age

1569
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:39,519
at age 11 5th grade i quit i started so

1570
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,039
then i started having

1571
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,838
more success you know what i'm like say

1572
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:46,639
placing at the state tournament um in

1573
00:49:43,838 --> 00:49:48,078
high school uh so you you write fifth so

1574
00:49:46,639 --> 00:49:49,759
sixth grade i placed it like the state

1575
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:51,440
local usa tournament you know so i'm

1576
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,880
like having more success

1577
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,280
um seventh grade was the first year i

1578
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:56,800
won the youth state tournament um so i'm

1579
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,640
getting better eighth grade i actually

1580
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,920
feel like i got pretty good but like

1581
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:01,118
when i went to the national tournaments

1582
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,039
i was still having really minimal

1583
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:04,240
success

1584
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:05,679
my freshman year i decided to quit

1585
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:06,879
football same reason it's like well i

1586
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:09,199
need to put more time into this my

1587
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:11,200
parents we got my dad luckily got a mat

1588
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,960
in my basement so you know there's no

1589
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,480
you so we have a year-round club and our

1590
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,639
impetus was that we didn't have this

1591
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,318
opportunity to go to a club year-round

1592
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,000
so we had a map in my basement had to go

1593
00:50:18,318 --> 00:50:21,358
find hey you want to

1594
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,880
you want to come wrestle

1595
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:24,880
yeah to find partners for myself what'd

1596
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,800
you do did you drill did you uh live

1597
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,640
wrestle what'd you do in the basement so

1598
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,640
actually i think you'll enjoy this i

1599
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:33,759
think the start of

1600
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,838
my scrambling was was kind of based

1601
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,880
around that so i got

1602
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,119
kind of i think it's probably my

1603
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,358
freshman sophomore i'm kind of the years

1604
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:44,079
are a little fuzzy right now um but

1605
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,039
probably my freshman sophomore junior

1606
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,720
year

1607
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:48,318
i found two kids who were really

1608
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:49,838
consistent who would come out like you

1609
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:51,119
would come out he would come out tuesday

1610
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:52,558
and this dude come out on a wednesday

1611
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,400
right and they would come every week and

1612
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:56,559
they were really consistent partners for

1613
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:58,079
me to have in the summer but they

1614
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,920
weren't nearly as good as me they were

1615
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,160
way worse so it's like

1616
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,240
okay how do i

1617
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:06,159
how do i make this kind of like fun and

1618
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:07,519
compelling for them to come back if i

1619
00:51:06,159 --> 00:51:09,519
swipe their ass they're not gonna come

1620
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:11,199
back right you know so it's like i would

1621
00:51:09,519 --> 00:51:13,280
let them get as close as they could this

1622
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:15,199
as i thought they could do a takedown

1623
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:17,440
before not getting it and then tried to

1624
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:18,719
like escape or get out so obviously if i

1625
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,400
let them get really close sometimes they

1626
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,000
get it you know so they're they're

1627
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,680
enjoying it i don't know if they ever

1628
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,239
knew i was doing this right i have no

1629
00:51:23,679 --> 00:51:27,679
idea um and that was kind of like the

1630
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,759
start because i had to figure my way out

1631
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:30,639
of bad positions because i had to try to

1632
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,640
make it

1633
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:33,598
entertaining for them where they still

1634
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:35,598
got something out of it and they want to

1635
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,200
come back the next week and i also got

1636
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:39,039
something out of it yeah i love this

1637
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,159
yeah because that relationship is so

1638
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:44,318
important with that like that

1639
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,558
i've had a few drilling partners

1640
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:48,639
training partners that were really

1641
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,400
important to my life and i i always

1642
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:52,799
wondered why it's difficult

1643
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,079
why it's so difficult to find them yeah

1644
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,680
like i

1645
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,440
if anyone's listening to this i'm

1646
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,799
looking for a judo person in the austin

1647
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,880
area actually

1648
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:03,440
getting the reps with people is hard

1649
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,400
even in jiu jitsu

1650
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,079
that

1651
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,519
it's just like people want to do the fun

1652
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,960
stuff they don't want to really put in

1653
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:12,239
the work yeah and it takes a certain

1654
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:13,760
kind of personality and then you also

1655
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:15,279
have to make it fun for the other person

1656
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,040
just like you said if there's a skill

1657
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,599
mismatch but also

1658
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:20,719
if you have an interest mismatch in

1659
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:22,240
terms of the

1660
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:23,279
the amount of drilling you want to do

1661
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,039
all that kind of stuff you have to

1662
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:27,599
figure out ways to make it fun yeah it's

1663
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:30,719
tricky so you did so yeah i think i did

1664
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:32,000
that and no one told me so i get some i

1665
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,639
get frustrated because now we have you

1666
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:36,559
know just in my academy we probably have

1667
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:38,000
50 60 high school kids only that are

1668
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,040
year round they're year round you know

1669
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,800
maybe they're not consistent in the

1670
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:42,000
summer or whatever but they're there so

1671
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,760
when they don't have a great partner

1672
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,159
they start whining it's like you little

1673
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,119
[ __ ] like you know i i some days i

1674
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:48,639
get really mad about it because it's

1675
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,559
like i had no partners i had to find

1676
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:52,400
freaking two partners come twice a week

1677
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:54,319
you guys there's still 22 people in the

1678
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,079
room i'm sorry there's not the perfect

1679
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:58,639
partner for you but like go work out

1680
00:52:56,079 --> 00:53:00,480
that dude yeah you know and get yeah so

1681
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,159
what was the switch the change was or is

1682
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,159
this gradual or

1683
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,199
okay yeah so uh let's do so ninth grade

1684
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:06,480
i quit football because i want to get

1685
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:08,799
really serious

1686
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,719
um what position football i was actually

1687
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,160
a nose tackle and i was but at that

1688
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:13,519
point so okay so i was also the other

1689
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,558
thing i kind of left over here i was

1690
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:19,119
really fat growing up yeah uh in a sixth

1691
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,000
grade i also decided okay i'm really fat

1692
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,200
and if i want to be competitive

1693
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,719
wrestling i shouldn't be fat because

1694
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:25,598
weight matters i went from 130 pounds to

1695
00:53:22,719 --> 00:53:27,199
100 pounds in sixth grade um

1696
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,760
so by the time i was a freshman i was

1697
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:31,439
119. so i still wasn't as heavy that was

1698
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:34,079
one in sixth grade so i was pretty small

1699
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,920
too but i was also slow unfortunately so

1700
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,280
uh they put me a nose tackle i you know

1701
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,639
i like the competitiveness so i was

1702
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,280
decent at it

1703
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,519
um so that's what you wrestled 119 my

1704
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:45,119
freshman year yeah mm-hmm

1705
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:47,679
so yeah so then i still i started having

1706
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:50,000
a lot of success state wise but not

1707
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:51,279
nationally it's my national success

1708
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,440
didn't come to like my junior year in

1709
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:54,640
high school um but yeah i was like

1710
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,000
grinding and getting better the whole

1711
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,598
time and then senior year i started

1712
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
having a lot of success nationally and i

1713
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,760
got recruited and then but then even my

1714
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,760
freshman year of college i uh this is

1715
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,520
where i love competing i would go every

1716
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,800
weekend because i knew if you if you

1717
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:11,119
take the emotions out of competition

1718
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:12,960
all it is is seeing your failures

1719
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,480
acknowledging them and then figuring out

1720
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,838
what you need to work on right if we

1721
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,159
take all the emotion out of it that's

1722
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:19,679
what it is so i wrestled 50 matches as a

1723
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:22,318
redshirt freshman which is incredibly

1724
00:54:19,679 --> 00:54:24,159
rare i had 10 losses so it's not like

1725
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:26,719
and like to not not so great guys you

1726
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:28,159
know so like my my skill level still at

1727
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:29,439
that point was not that great and then

1728
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,318
the next year i came out and made the

1729
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:34,639
ncaa finals so my my i made a gigantic

1730
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:36,719
jump in that redshirt year to the to to

1731
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:40,318
the real freshman year so it's a few

1732
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:42,239
questions yeah where did the funk style

1733
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,318
wrestling the the creative stuff get

1734
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:46,159
developed or which stage

1735
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:47,838
so i so i think like looking

1736
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,199
retroactively there's no there's no

1737
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:50,159
intention to start when i was in high

1738
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:52,159
school with those kids but i think

1739
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,639
that's kind of like

1740
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:56,798
what was happening right

1741
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:58,639
so what i would really say is i i had

1742
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:01,599
one influential coach my rhetoric of

1743
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:03,039
college named mike iron man um great guy

1744
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,880
but then the second thing was it was

1745
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:07,440
just out of necessity i had this burning

1746
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,640
desire to be the best and when i was

1747
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,159
getting my ass kicked every day in the

1748
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:11,838
room because you know retirement was

1749
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,239
there we had all-american 157 we had

1750
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:15,838
all-american 150 184 so i wasn't having

1751
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,558
a ton of success

1752
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:21,358
and very quickly i realized from like a

1753
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,880
more traditional athletic perspective

1754
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:25,358
strength and speed i couldn't keep up

1755
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,200
with anyone i was way worse so it's like

1756
00:55:25,358 --> 00:55:29,519
okay [ __ ] how do i how do i do this you

1757
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,838
know i want to do this how do i do this

1758
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:33,440
there's got to be a way you know so mike

1759
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:35,039
ironman showed me a couple things but

1760
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,760
then it was just like this

1761
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:40,159
creative expansion for the next you know

1762
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:42,480
through say three to five years um and

1763
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:43,679
then even now it's like i don't know

1764
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,199
there's something and maybe you feel

1765
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:46,960
this way about judo or

1766
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:49,039
there's something that's like

1767
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:51,760
fun about the way the body moves and

1768
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:53,599
works and and and exploring something

1769
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,880
new and thinking about hey wrestling's

1770
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,880
been happening at a relatively high

1771
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,920
level for we'll say 80 to 90 years in

1772
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,960
america

1773
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,559
um

1774
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,240
and there's still new things being

1775
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:03,839
developed and so when you see something

1776
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,519
you're like oh damn like that's great or

1777
00:56:03,838 --> 00:56:06,880
like jason knoll if i have to win dicks

1778
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,719
i'm like how did i not think of that

1779
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,318
[ __ ] like why did i think that's so easy

1780
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:12,719
i should i should have thought of that

1781
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:13,599
you know so there's this like obsession

1782
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:15,679
with

1783
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:17,039
the sport of wrestling and you know

1784
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:18,480
positions where

1785
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:19,759
um

1786
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,880
i actually think sometimes think i

1787
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,119
wouldn't have smartphones because i may

1788
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,318
have been distracted by my smartphone

1789
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,000
maybe i wouldn't have been selling so

1790
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:28,079
obsessed but maybe but you know some

1791
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,400
days i had couldn't finish the single

1792
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:31,839
leg on this specific person or or they

1793
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,160
maybe they were finishing on me you know

1794
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:36,639
they go home and i just [ __ ] obsessed

1795
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:39,118
about that one position like okay how do

1796
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:40,960
what what am i missing here and and not

1797
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,960
just accepting like that whatever the

1798
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,440
coach says is the answer but like what

1799
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,318
am i missing what ways can my body move

1800
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,480
that no one's told me it can move yet

1801
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:51,920
where can my arms go right where can i

1802
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:54,159
do all these things and so i would just

1803
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:55,280
obsess about these things and then you

1804
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:57,838
know sometimes you come in the next day

1805
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,359
you say oh well maybe this you know and

1806
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:00,639
maybe it works maybe it doesn't maybe it

1807
00:56:59,358 --> 00:57:02,078
works twice and it doesn't work the next

1808
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:04,159
time and so you kind of like have this

1809
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,119
creative process and it's like

1810
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,798
there's a lot of things that are on the

1811
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,400
cutting room floor that never made it to

1812
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:10,239
the the light because you thought they'd

1813
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,599
be good and they failed and they sucked

1814
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:14,719
and then you know to the point where

1815
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:16,640
like my senior year um

1816
00:57:14,719 --> 00:57:18,399
i got to this point where the the people

1817
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:20,400
then they were just figures figures

1818
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,680
would wrestle in my head about positions

1819
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,358
i was thinking about i wouldn't tell

1820
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:24,798
them what to do they would just

1821
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:27,440
they would go in my head and then like

1822
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:29,199
something oh [ __ ] wait that's it that

1823
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,639
that's it that just happened that's the

1824
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:32,719
move and then i go try to practice and

1825
00:57:30,639 --> 00:57:34,558
sure enough boom that's the move that's

1826
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:36,480
exactly what you have alpha zero playing

1827
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:39,040
learning chess you have uh

1828
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:42,880
oh no it's called self plays uh you have

1829
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:45,119
uh what did the figures have um

1830
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,880
like no faces they were just like did

1831
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:49,440
they have a human form or is it just

1832
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,720
like stick figures essentially oh there

1833
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,079
was not like yeah it was not like humans

1834
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:54,399
it was more like stick fig it wouldn't

1835
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:56,640
stick figures exactly like they were uh

1836
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,480
so they had some volume yeah it was like

1837
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,318
it was like a gray person and they had

1838
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,679
you know three dimensions essentially

1839
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:03,039
because i had to see how the things

1840
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:04,960
moved and

1841
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:07,599
yeah

1842
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:10,798
uh i mean this is exactly what uh open

1843
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:12,318
ai and uh demand at google or uh

1844
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:13,280
i don't know if you've seen

1845
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:14,880
but there's something called

1846
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,160
reinforcement learning in artificial

1847
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,920
intelligence where

1848
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:21,279
you have like they've done it for like

1849
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:23,119
sumo wrestling you have you have like

1850
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:26,000
you have these two stick figures that

1851
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:27,280
don't even know how to get up at first

1852
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,559
and they figure out how to stand on

1853
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:30,480
their two feet

1854
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,720
and then they figure out how to push the

1855
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,240
other person off of the the

1856
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:36,078
pedestal wait so

1857
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:38,078
but what about like uh when you look at

1858
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:39,920
the the boston dynamics sometimes they

1859
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,000
have trouble with like jumping and

1860
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,599
balancing and other stuff so are they

1861
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,480
are they doing that same program or no

1862
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,720
no no no this different the the

1863
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:52,159
everything boston dynamics is doing

1864
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:55,039
is hard-coded so it's not

1865
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:56,639
it's not learning the

1866
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:58,400
all the sophisticated movements and

1867
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:00,159
strategies like high-level strategies

1868
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:01,680
and movement that's all

1869
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:03,440
something that boston dynamics does not

1870
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:06,239
do and if it does it like the parkour

1871
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,798
stuff that's all hard-coded in oh

1872
00:59:06,239 --> 00:59:09,598
the people like project and think like

1873
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:11,838
these

1874
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,000
robots have like discovered

1875
00:59:11,838 --> 00:59:15,838
like how to move in sophisticated ways

1876
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,480
they haven't well that's what when you

1877
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:20,798
and john were talking about the the

1878
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:23,519
grappling robot yeah i mean the one

1879
00:59:20,798 --> 00:59:25,599
thing i was i was obsessing about in my

1880
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,599
head is that

1881
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,440
with the chest right if a chess piece

1882
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,200
moves right uh the horse can move like

1883
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,720
an l right

1884
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,558
it can only move like an l it doesn't

1885
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:36,798
matter if it moves at two meters per

1886
00:59:34,559 --> 00:59:38,480
second or seven meters per second it can

1887
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:40,880
only it can only move there right

1888
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,079
whereas like a single leg i can shoot a

1889
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,440
single leg with many different

1890
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:45,280
velocities

1891
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,679
i can shoot at different angles i can

1892
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,359
shoot with different amounts of force

1893
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:50,798
right i can shoot with my my head up

1894
00:59:49,358 --> 00:59:52,159
versus my head i mean right all these

1895
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:54,159
things are going to matter if we're

1896
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:56,239
talking about a human being defending

1897
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:57,598
the single leg all of those things are

1898
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:59,279
going to matter and and that's where

1899
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,960
human beings are

1900
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:02,640
who wrestle are calculating those things

1901
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,798
subconsciously they're obviously not

1902
01:00:02,639 --> 01:00:06,719
consciously calculating in their head oh

1903
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:08,079
the the forces coming at me at this so i

1904
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:09,199
need to do that right they're just doing

1905
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,359
it

1906
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:13,279
but see the the thing is so you would

1907
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:14,639
absolutely if you're doing a robot that

1908
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:16,480
you're wrestling you're going to have to

1909
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:19,039
constrain the speed at which it moves

1910
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,599
and the power that it's able to deliver

1911
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:23,358
so that presumably that'll be the

1912
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,280
limitations so then it'll be just the

1913
01:00:23,358 --> 01:00:27,920
same exact way as a human but then but

1914
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,760
it's good to even so if we go human max

1915
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,440
force right jordan bros double max force

1916
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,480
right that's the highest as highest we

1917
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:36,960
get then we go down from there um

1918
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,880
even even with even within that it's

1919
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,318
like sometimes i can choose single leg

1920
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:41,838
with a maximum force of i don't know

1921
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:43,039
we'll just say we'll say 20. this is a

1922
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:45,279
number right

1923
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:47,039
i don't know shoot at 20 because i feel

1924
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,519
sometimes i shoot at 15. sometimes you

1925
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:50,960
shoot at 12 right because you you feel

1926
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:52,719
something in your opponent that makes

1927
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:54,960
you do it differently so they would have

1928
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:56,318
to learn how and then you know all these

1929
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:59,039
different things and sometimes maybe i

1930
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:01,358
clamp a little harder so the the robot

1931
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,599
would have to learn all these different

1932
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:06,159
incoming inputs to the system and then

1933
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:08,160
create this reaction oh no no 100 so

1934
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:09,679
this would be all continuous like yeah

1935
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:11,920
so unlike chess it would not it's just

1936
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:12,639
chess is discreet there's it's uh one

1937
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,200
then

1938
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:17,519
you move it's it's a very specific set

1939
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:19,279
of moves now here you would those are

1940
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,679
all variables you control and they're

1941
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,920
continuous variables so the speed the

1942
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:26,558
force there's actuators so there's all

1943
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:28,400
these joints right yeah you can move i

1944
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,160
mean it's just an optimization problem

1945
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,440
it's kind of fast it's fascinating so

1946
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:33,358
i've been fascinated thinking about it

1947
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:34,720
since you guys talked about it with i it

1948
01:01:33,358 --> 01:01:36,078
was a long time ago i listened to it

1949
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:37,919
probably three three to four weeks going

1950
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:41,599
up and kind of been like obsessing about

1951
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:42,960
it ever since but yeah it just changes

1952
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,079
when um

1953
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,079
so unlike boxing for example or striking

1954
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:49,280
it you know once you grab a hold of

1955
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:52,318
somebody

1956
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,160
it change you're now one body right so

1957
01:01:52,318 --> 01:01:56,639
yeah it's very complicated it's not just

1958
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:58,639
shooting a a double leg without like

1959
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:00,318
maybe doing like

1960
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:02,159
like faking a double leg and then

1961
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:04,798
shooting the double leg that's very

1962
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:07,440
doable with robotics but then like

1963
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:11,440
doing a clinch and from there

1964
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,440
doing like a russian tie like that

1965
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,760
that's uh i think that's way harder than

1966
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:18,000
people realize in terms of how many

1967
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,319
things are involved like the force of

1968
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:21,599
the grip the leverage you're providing

1969
01:02:20,318 --> 01:02:23,838
with all the different parts of the

1970
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:26,000
shoulder and the arm and the torso the

1971
01:02:23,838 --> 01:02:27,679
twist how much of your weight are you

1972
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,679
allocating like leaning on the other

1973
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,679
person yeah like taking weight off of

1974
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:33,199
one of your legs and the other leg all

1975
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,558
of that i think

1976
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:36,558
that's the really interesting thing

1977
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,960
about humans is we're able to do all of

1978
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:40,880
this calculation subconsciously yeah

1979
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,119
subconsciously yeah and that's what i've

1980
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,880
been thinking about since we it's like

1981
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,200
how many things even these high school

1982
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:49,680
athletes who are like getting medium

1983
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:51,439
good are subconsciously thinking about

1984
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:53,279
all the time or not even not even

1985
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:55,599
thinking about sorry reacting to

1986
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,440
um but then even like for me i'm you

1987
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:58,640
know i'm a few orders of meg do better

1988
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,318
than somebody's kid that player and so

1989
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:01,358
when i when i go like super hard it's

1990
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,880
like

1991
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:04,719
i can feel their weight moving the wrong

1992
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,079
direction and so for me to off balance

1993
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:08,159
them or trip them or whatever it's kind

1994
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:10,480
of easy sometimes you know because

1995
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:12,078
they're not feeling it

1996
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,400
the right way right or their timing's

1997
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:15,680
just a little bit off or the way they're

1998
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:17,680
grabbing the hip maybe they should be up

1999
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:18,798
a little higher right these really small

2000
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:19,838
things

2001
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:21,440
um

2002
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:23,038
yeah i think that's all easy to take

2003
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:24,639
advantage of for a robot it's just

2004
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:26,799
there's so many things

2005
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:28,719
the the big problem

2006
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:30,079
is ethically

2007
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:32,318
i don't know how many people are willing

2008
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,079
to train with a robot because

2009
01:03:32,318 --> 01:03:36,079
you're gonna get hurt well couldn't you

2010
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:38,798
make a robot change the robot or no

2011
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,960
yes but then it's expensive

2012
01:03:38,798 --> 01:03:43,440
so because they're gonna put the padding

2013
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:44,880
on that thing i know but but then it's

2014
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,760
not

2015
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,160
you know

2016
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:51,039
it it's

2017
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:52,239
then uh you're not capturing the full

2018
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,760
why can't you put like some rubber

2019
01:03:52,239 --> 01:03:56,159
coating on them right you know something

2020
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:58,640
for that effect you could i mean that

2021
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,960
you could yeah you could i mean you're

2022
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:03,440
talking about robots that are

2023
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:05,838
these are humanoid robots so

2024
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,280
we're talking about 500 000 million

2025
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:08,719
robots

2026
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,880
so

2027
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,480
you would have to be motivated

2028
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,640
spend a lot of money to spend a lot of

2029
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,318
money because you have to have them

2030
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:17,038
wrestle

2031
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:18,000
for

2032
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,200
like

2033
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,559
a lot

2034
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,000
to get better you have to get better

2035
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:25,039
yeah and then

2036
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,920
the the open question is

2037
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,839
how long does it take to get good enough

2038
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,680
to beat a human

2039
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:33,440
uh

2040
01:04:31,679 --> 01:04:34,798
i don't i don't think i don't think we

2041
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,079
understand i don't know i don't think

2042
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,880
you understand

2043
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:40,400
how hard wrestling is yeah like is it a

2044
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,760
really hard problem like what's harder

2045
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,318
chest or wrestling

2046
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:45,520
by far not even close that's yeah that's

2047
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:47,440
the sense

2048
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:49,759
so because there's an infinite amount of

2049
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,679
moves right uh and possibilities so once

2050
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,440
i shoot the single leg now you have

2051
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:55,199
x amount of choices once you make your

2052
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:57,119
choice now i have a choice x amount of

2053
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:58,480
choices no i now you have x amount

2054
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,838
choice on the defense and we can just

2055
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,119
keep going back and forth right and this

2056
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:02,639
number becomes

2057
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:04,240
yeah but the same happens with chess

2058
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:05,838
correct but then in wrestling you have

2059
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:08,159
to make these

2060
01:05:05,838 --> 01:05:09,199
movements in very instantaneously right

2061
01:05:08,159 --> 01:05:11,118
because i should sing like i'm not going

2062
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:12,798
to wait and say what's your defense yeah

2063
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:14,720
right you mean instantaneously and then

2064
01:05:12,798 --> 01:05:16,798
also again based on the force and the

2065
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:19,279
vectors and and the angles

2066
01:05:16,798 --> 01:05:20,960
you have to calculate that and adjust so

2067
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,559
really you know if you're saying well i

2068
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,798
can shoot a single like it's not like

2069
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,480
moving it's not one move right it's if

2070
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:28,000
you want to talk about different forces

2071
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:29,358
and stuff it could be hundreds or

2072
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,199
thousands of different moves based on

2073
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:32,639
how hard i shoot it the angle the

2074
01:05:31,199 --> 01:05:34,558
direction all of those things yeah but

2075
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:36,960
wait a minute so robots can do this kind

2076
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,559
of stuff really fast you would i

2077
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:41,199
people probably know the physiology of

2078
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:42,880
this but it's the the reaction speed for

2079
01:05:41,199 --> 01:05:44,318
a human is maybe 100 milliseconds

2080
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:46,798
something like that i don't know from

2081
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:47,920
sensation to to

2082
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:49,838
like from

2083
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,200
the the signal traveling up your two

2084
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:54,000
brain and down i don't know what that

2085
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:56,798
number is but uh robots certainly could

2086
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:59,838
do it way faster it you would actually

2087
01:05:56,798 --> 01:06:01,440
have to like constrain the speed

2088
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:02,639
well so the robot's already killing the

2089
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,039
chess people

2090
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:06,639
right so yeah theoretically they could

2091
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,480
eventually beat wrestlers but you asked

2092
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,558
what was hard wrestling or chess

2093
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:12,880
yeah and i think wrestling is because of

2094
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:15,280
the time component in it and then the

2095
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,358
and and the physicality of

2096
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:19,280
you know is it this force or that force

2097
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:20,880
you know because if if i'm gonna say say

2098
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,240
we're in a seat belt side by side right

2099
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,000
a wrestling seatbelt nothing too

2100
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:27,199
based on the pressure you're giving me i

2101
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,400
might do a bunch of different things

2102
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,318
right and so like to an untrained eye

2103
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:34,798
they might both look like the same thing

2104
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:36,239
from you to a trained feel it's like

2105
01:06:34,798 --> 01:06:37,599
well in one case it's really evident i

2106
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:39,519
should go this way in other cases

2107
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,440
evident i should go that way so the

2108
01:06:39,519 --> 01:06:43,038
other thing to consider just like with

2109
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:45,599
chess

2110
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:48,000
the ai systems

2111
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:49,599
so human versus human play a certain way

2112
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,599
together they actually haven't

2113
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,798
considered a really large number of

2114
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:54,640
strategies

2115
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:56,000
that ai systems discover so one

2116
01:06:54,639 --> 01:06:58,078
possibility with a robot they'll

2117
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:00,719
discover certain ties and certain

2118
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:02,960
takedowns what i'm saying that like will

2119
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:04,480
dominate no matter what the human does

2120
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,240
you think that so you think there's that

2121
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,159
so this i mean this was somewhat the

2122
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:10,078
wrestling's so fun is there's even after

2123
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:12,558
80 to 90 years there's this continuous

2124
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,318
evolution yeah so you can do some like

2125
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:16,559
low single type thing like john smith

2126
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:18,480
type of situation well like a downbot go

2127
01:07:16,559 --> 01:07:20,079
behind is something that has really i

2128
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:21,838
would say really in the last five-ish

2129
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:24,079
years has really been evolved what's the

2130
01:07:21,838 --> 01:07:25,838
goal behind downbot go behind so when

2131
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:27,599
you're sh well they just head inside or

2132
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:29,838
head outside matters but there's one for

2133
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:32,480
both you shoot at me essentially i take

2134
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:34,159
my leg boom and then so that was kind of

2135
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:35,519
in existence when i was in college right

2136
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:37,199
you down block them and you stop but

2137
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:39,119
usually you hit on this side of their

2138
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:40,639
head right and now immediately as you

2139
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,640
shoot i attack that shoulder and then i

2140
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:45,679
start hitting a go behind on you

2141
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:47,038
right and so like that in its current

2142
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:48,480
incarnation

2143
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,079
it absolutely wasn't when i was in

2144
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:51,679
college i would say it probably became

2145
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:53,359
popular

2146
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,598
five to seven years ago so yeah there's

2147
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:57,199
these big things that are happening

2148
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:58,480
and now now i really want a robot

2149
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,239
because i want to be ahead of the game i

2150
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,000
want to know exactly what i'm missing i

2151
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,318
mean one interesting thing you have with

2152
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,079
alpha zero that plays chess

2153
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:08,318
is um

2154
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:11,280
it sacrifices pieces much more than

2155
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:13,119
humans do so give you a piece and not

2156
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:16,719
only does it give you a piece it will

2157
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:18,239
wait a bunch of moves before it makes

2158
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:20,158
you pay

2159
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:22,000
so because it knows that that's better

2160
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:24,719
for the long term long term so like

2161
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,960
humans rarely sacrifice without

2162
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:29,838
getting the piece back like two or three

2163
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,198
moves after uh alpha zero can wait like

2164
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:32,079
five moves

2165
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:33,278
so

2166
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:34,960
so basically

2167
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:37,520
you'll have you potentially with

2168
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:39,759
wrestling you might have a a robot that

2169
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,239
like puts itself in bad positions but in

2170
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:44,960
a certain kind of way then that will

2171
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:48,318
actually lure the opponent in to trap

2172
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,319
exactly what my style's based on

2173
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:52,639
you basically narrow one one thing to do

2174
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,000
is you narrow the set of choices you put

2175
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,359
yourself in a bad position but and

2176
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,560
there's a set of choices for them

2177
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,440
because they're not used to it yeah

2178
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:01,759
they're not used to it and and then you

2179
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:04,639
you drag them into uh into your

2180
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,719
yeah so but there's also

2181
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:08,079
the problem is there's mechanical issues

2182
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,119
like it's actually just difficult to

2183
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:13,198
build robots that uh are able to sense

2184
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:15,198
because we have sensation throughout our

2185
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:16,719
body yeah it's just difficult to build

2186
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:18,559
that kind of robot it's expensive you

2187
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:20,880
start talking about multi multi-million

2188
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,120
dollars and then people start asking you

2189
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,719
questions why did you invest all this

2190
01:09:23,119 --> 01:09:25,519
money

2191
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,719
duh

2192
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:29,520
hello

2193
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:31,920
it could be a better investment okay uh

2194
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,520
so i mentioned john smith yeah

2195
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,239
he is if people don't know one of the

2196
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,480
great wrestlers wrestling coaches ever

2197
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,919
he's also creative like you he spoke

2198
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:41,439
really highly of you what do you think

2199
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,920
about that guy did you guys ever work

2200
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,278
together not really uh so i so you know

2201
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,679
what when i was a senior and i had the

2202
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:50,560
people wrestling in my head uh i was

2203
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:52,079
lucky enough to be doing um

2204
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,600
i was pretty much graduated so i did an

2205
01:09:52,079 --> 01:09:55,359
independent study with the sports i call

2206
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,880
i was potentially going to uh grad

2207
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:58,399
school for sports psych well i actually

2208
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:00,640
did nine credits and then

2209
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:02,960
i decided i didn't want to do any more i

2210
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,039
continued learning on my own um but i

2211
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:06,480
had an independent study with uh the guy

2212
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:08,319
who's head of usa track and field

2213
01:10:06,479 --> 01:10:09,919
support psych so i guess so the other

2214
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:11,439
here was the class was i got to go sit

2215
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,840
down and talk with him for an hour and

2216
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:14,879
he was like fascinated by me so he

2217
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:16,400
didn't really make me do homework it was

2218
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,000
like the greatest three credits ever

2219
01:10:16,399 --> 01:10:21,439
we just talked it was i learned so much

2220
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:23,359
it was so awesome um but so i started so

2221
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:24,879
one time it came up that i had these

2222
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:26,000
robot or people wrestling in my head you

2223
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,760
know and he said well who else do you

2224
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,960
think i said but john smith happened so

2225
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:30,800
i went and got john smith's number and

2226
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:32,640
called him and say you've ever had these

2227
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,480
people wrestling in your head and he

2228
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,679
said yeah but shouldn't stop coaching

2229
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:37,198
they went away

2230
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,359
same thing happened to me they started

2231
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:41,759
coaching they went away so if i really

2232
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:43,359
force myself now and i'm like

2233
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,560
you know i see something in practice and

2234
01:10:43,359 --> 01:10:45,839
it's really high level because high

2235
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:47,199
school wrestling i don't want to make

2236
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,880
you guys feel bad but it's like it's a

2237
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:50,479
little bit lower level right so if like

2238
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,000
keegan for example who won the journey

2239
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,919
if he's struggling with the problem or

2240
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:54,800
ask me a question

2241
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:56,800
and

2242
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,480
i can force myself to like see the

2243
01:10:56,800 --> 01:10:59,840
bodies moving and think about it again

2244
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:01,919
you know kind of like i was in the early

2245
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:03,679
age but it won't just it won't just flow

2246
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,239
there anymore so he said it went away

2247
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:08,158
and for me it went away also

2248
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:10,799
by the way if you can

2249
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:13,839
pause on on the on

2250
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:16,400
on the bodies in your head yeah uh what

2251
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:18,960
like how are they generating new ideas

2252
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:20,079
are they just kind of i don't know

2253
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,279
you tell me

2254
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:23,439
so it's just

2255
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:26,479
they're just like scrambling in your

2256
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:28,399
head it would be specifically based on a

2257
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:30,319
problem i was struggling with or a

2258
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:32,000
specific position you know kind of it

2259
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:33,679
goes in for a single and then and then

2260
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,920
go from there yeah so like i'm sitting

2261
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,760
in geography class and you know i don't

2262
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,960
have to work that hard because it's easy

2263
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:40,239
right and

2264
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,679
yeah i'm just sitting there like kind of

2265
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:42,879
acting like i'm looking at the board and

2266
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:45,199
these guys are wrestling and i'm

2267
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:47,760
watching them wrestle and yeah sometimes

2268
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:50,399
they come up with a really good solution

2269
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:52,239
is there somebody you uh looked up to

2270
01:11:50,399 --> 01:11:55,359
style wise

2271
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:57,439
matt gable john smith yeah all these

2272
01:11:55,359 --> 01:12:00,559
like like legends status people try

2273
01:11:57,439 --> 01:12:02,639
gable or cable um john smith after the

2274
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,800
fact so the problem with wrestling in my

2275
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:06,480
era was you couldn't watch it there was

2276
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,159
no there's no access right it wasn't it

2277
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:09,119
wasn't really available even if you want

2278
01:12:08,158 --> 01:12:10,799
to say

2279
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:11,840
go find a bunch of john smith they're

2280
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,360
kind of hard to find right there's a

2281
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:15,840
couple of them on youtube but i've

2282
01:12:13,359 --> 01:12:17,839
obviously seen all of those but in in my

2283
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,039
era there was there really wasn't any of

2284
01:12:17,840 --> 01:12:20,319
it so it was hard to be a fan of

2285
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:21,519
something and that's what wrestling

2286
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:23,439
wrestling has

2287
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,600
his the fans are going like this because

2288
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:27,599
now you know you flip on the flow app

2289
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,440
and you can watch uh you know something

2290
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,520
that's happening in europe right we can

2291
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:33,919
do this easily so we can be a fan of

2292
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:35,840
people um so now i'm more a fan of

2293
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,158
wrestling than i was then because there

2294
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,079
just was no access so now i can watch

2295
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:41,920
someone i like and say oh [ __ ] like that

2296
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:43,600
guy's wrestling oh boom i put my phone

2297
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:45,600
on i watched them wrestle you know that

2298
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:48,239
type of thing you know

2299
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,400
on a quick rant it's really frustrating

2300
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:53,039
that you can't watch the olympics

2301
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:53,839
oh my god it's so frustrating i i've

2302
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:55,760
been

2303
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,440
i i'm i'm i think i'm going to go to war

2304
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,840
go to nbc's headquarters i'll go with

2305
01:12:57,439 --> 01:13:01,198
you you got you got a soldier here i was

2306
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:03,360
talking to jimmy

2307
01:13:01,198 --> 01:13:06,719
uh jimmy pedro he was surprised by this

2308
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:08,319
too most matches you can't see even you

2309
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:11,279
talk about like uh

2310
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:13,759
uh comeback uh gable steals and

2311
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:16,559
yeah you can't see the full match you

2312
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:18,640
get like a crappy highlight so the two

2313
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,320
the two biggest things in rightlook and

2314
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:23,280
really the three the ncaa championships

2315
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:25,279
on espn yeah the olympic trials are on

2316
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:27,198
nbc and the olympics are nbc and these

2317
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:28,800
things these these companies are so big

2318
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:31,359
they don't have a department dedicated

2319
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:32,640
to selling their rights to that footage

2320
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:34,319
right so the

2321
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,440
the rights to wrestling footage which no

2322
01:13:34,319 --> 01:13:36,719
one really cares all that much about

2323
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:38,879
except a niche

2324
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:41,600
are the exact same as track and field or

2325
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:44,000
and or basketball number x so yes all of

2326
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,320
this stuff is completely inaccessible to

2327
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,158
us the the nca's the olympic trials in

2328
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:51,119
the olympics you can't go watch old film

2329
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:52,479
on it it sucks yeah older current film

2330
01:13:51,119 --> 01:13:54,399
yeah uh

2331
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:56,319
so you can't even watch the game match

2332
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:58,000
the gable students no they did a you

2333
01:13:56,319 --> 01:14:01,439
know they do something that annoys the

2334
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,679
[ __ ] out of me what okay they they they

2335
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:05,198
they do like a three or two minute

2336
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,600
highlight

2337
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:09,039
so it's like they capture the most

2338
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,159
important thing

2339
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:12,238
but

2340
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:14,319
like it's all about the build up yeah

2341
01:14:12,238 --> 01:14:16,959
yeah it's like that very beginning when

2342
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:19,198
you step on the mat and the nerves and

2343
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,000
you walk out and like that

2344
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:21,919
i mean

2345
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:24,158
i don't know uh

2346
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,640
you miss then then when the the triumph

2347
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:29,039
happens or the heartbreak happens

2348
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:30,880
it has that much more power yeah if you

2349
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:32,719
want to go to war with nbc or espn i'm

2350
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:34,800
i'm happy to join i think this is

2351
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:38,079
[ __ ]

2352
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:40,480
well i mean uh does the ioc or the ioc

2353
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:43,279
is selling the for the olympics is the

2354
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:45,359
one that's making well so nbc broadcast

2355
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:47,198
so they obviously have the live rights

2356
01:14:45,359 --> 01:14:48,639
you would think they would have recorded

2357
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:50,158
if the i mean they're the ones recording

2358
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:52,640
it you'd think they keep the rights when

2359
01:14:50,158 --> 01:14:54,559
you think no no i they're like getting a

2360
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,640
license of it they're getting exclusive

2361
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:57,760
like license but like the you know for

2362
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,400
example

2363
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:03,520
uh i've had this i talked to travis

2364
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:05,198
stevens the g dog player and

2365
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,800
there's a

2366
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:07,919
really sort of famous match it's a

2367
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,440
heartbreak

2368
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:13,119
in his career from uh 2012 olympics

2369
01:15:11,439 --> 01:15:15,198
where he goes against the german ole

2370
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:16,479
bischoff whatever it's a 20-minute match

2371
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:18,960
to go to war

2372
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:20,879
and that's not available anywhere but

2373
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:23,359
it's uploaded on youtube

2374
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:26,239
and set to private the reason i know

2375
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:28,238
this is because on the ioc channel so

2376
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:30,479
they've uploaded all of these matches

2377
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:34,238
they haven't been put up so actually so

2378
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:36,399
my olympic match the the one i won

2379
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:38,879
got put public and so i don't know if it

2380
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:40,960
was private it got put up on youtube

2381
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,880
uh i was ordered to it the week of my

2382
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:45,679
jake paul fight it was so dumb i'm like

2383
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:47,600
why this is every 13 years later this is

2384
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:50,480
[ __ ] like this should have been up

2385
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:52,719
so i mean okay so what about olympic

2386
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:55,119
trials footage that has to be the usoc

2387
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:56,960
then or nbc

2388
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:58,800
uh so i know like okay so i don't flow

2389
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,840
right cause i work for them i know if

2390
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:01,920
flow

2391
01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,360
buys your event or whatever right they

2392
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:04,640
buy the rights

2393
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,719
generally in the contract they'll have

2394
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:08,800
rights to both live stream it and then

2395
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:11,760
use that footage at any point moving

2396
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:13,679
forward so those matches live on flow's

2397
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,679
website that's why i would be surprised

2398
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:16,719
that if nbc didn't have something

2399
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,880
similar

2400
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:20,158
flow does a pretty good job of providing

2401
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:21,440
like uh

2402
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:23,679
a place where you can watch all these

2403
01:16:21,439 --> 01:16:24,719
matches nbc does not that's not it yeah

2404
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,719
and and

2405
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,719
and also there's an argument with flo as

2406
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,880
well but certainly with olympics there's

2407
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,719
a difference between what flow does and

2408
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,560
what the olympics represent what do you

2409
01:16:32,719 --> 01:16:35,760
mean by that like it feels like the

2410
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:38,000
olympics

2411
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,280
which is what the charter says

2412
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:42,079
should be

2413
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:43,920
as accessible as possible yes like true

2414
01:16:42,079 --> 01:16:45,920
like you should really lower the barrier

2415
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,199
for entry for the olympics you know

2416
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,880
that's what the charter says but those

2417
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:50,799
people in the ioc those these are the

2418
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,640
worst people ever yeah they're very bad

2419
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,920
well they're not they're not bad they

2420
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,679
just lost

2421
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:57,760
touch of the dream they once had when

2422
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,039
they joined the ioc well i would argue i

2423
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,840
would argue all the way back that these

2424
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:04,479
are rich fat cats who like i get so mad

2425
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:06,960
about the ncaa which finally now got rid

2426
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:08,559
of this term [ __ ] term amateurism

2427
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,079
it's like well there's some holy grail

2428
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:12,000
where you can't make money to be an

2429
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:14,399
amateur athlete but the people who own

2430
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:15,920
the ioc are the people who own the

2431
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:17,679
institutions college institutions are

2432
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,039
making loads of money off of you that's

2433
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:22,079
crap

2434
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:24,399
so you competed like you said at the

2435
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:26,399
2008 olympics

2436
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:27,759
did you believe you can win gold yeah

2437
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:30,319
absolutely

2438
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:33,199
so the your mental game was on point

2439
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:35,039
yeah i was ready so what what went wrong

2440
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:37,279
that wasn't good enough that was what i

2441
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:39,359
said yeah yeah i mean so at that point

2442
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,880
in time um

2443
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:43,198
i it was my first year of international

2444
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,119
competition so when i came out in 2007

2445
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:46,719
it was my first time making 74 kilograms

2446
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:49,920
which is pretty small for me

2447
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:51,439
um i had some failures but then quickly

2448
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:52,480
i turned that around and i was having

2449
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:54,719
success

2450
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:56,399
uh in america i was beating everyone i

2451
01:17:54,719 --> 01:17:58,880
don't see easy but

2452
01:17:56,399 --> 01:18:01,359
yeah just you know i've i was doing

2453
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:02,319
really well um i went international one

2454
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:04,880
time

2455
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:07,840
and i i there was one match i got

2456
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,480
cheated on the russians they're cheaters

2457
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,480
she was ukraine not russia

2458
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:13,439
i lost one real match where i actually

2459
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,839
lost

2460
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,439
um and it was to dennis sargus who would

2461
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,199
go on to win three world titles he was

2462
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:20,960
behind the t of that year and it was

2463
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:22,799
competitive you know so i knew okay i'm

2464
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:23,679
like i'm going with the best guys in the

2465
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:26,000
world

2466
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:26,960
uh i beat a bunch of other guys who you

2467
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,679
know were

2468
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,840
were good and had past decent results so

2469
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:34,319
like i knew i was like right there

2470
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,840
unfortunately i ran this guy ivan

2471
01:18:34,319 --> 01:18:37,920
fundora and

2472
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,960
in i had someone do scouting reports for

2473
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,800
him actually my high school coach you're

2474
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:42,960
know coaches for our academy john messen

2475
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:44,640
rank and founder was the worst stylistic

2476
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:47,439
matchup i got him

2477
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:49,679
um and i lost him second round so i just

2478
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:51,198
i wasn't good enough i you know i had i

2479
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,239
decided to keep wrestling i probably

2480
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:54,079
would have gotten better but at that

2481
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:56,479
point diamonds wasn't in the cards so in

2482
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:58,399
your division was like you said city of

2483
01:18:56,479 --> 01:18:59,439
vice has the tf

2484
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:00,960
um

2485
01:18:59,439 --> 01:19:02,799
that guest special

2486
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:04,880
he's very special so that would be my

2487
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,800
other guy that you asked earlier who i

2488
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:08,079
enjoyed watching and that was a guy

2489
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,960
again it was kind of after the fact

2490
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:11,359
because

2491
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,880
it was hard to access footage but he was

2492
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:14,880
a lot of fun to watch what do you think

2493
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,359
made him great

2494
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:19,359
uh a lot of people talk to about him as

2495
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,519
potentially one of the great

2496
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:24,079
greatest ever absolutely i mean six and

2497
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,560
so he won six and three six worlds nine

2498
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:27,920
uh six worlds three olympics nine total

2499
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,000
which there's only one or two people

2500
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:31,920
above that um

2501
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,359
so again it was it was hard to watch any

2502
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,679
live footage of him but from what i've

2503
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:37,759
seen his his feel is different he was

2504
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:39,359
just ahead of his time and the feel and

2505
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,960
the touch he had for certain moves and

2506
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:43,439
different things because obviously

2507
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,480
physically he's kind of unimposing he's

2508
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:45,919
um

2509
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,919
you know taller and skinnier which is

2510
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,279
you know it it can work wrestling but it

2511
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,880
is by

2512
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:54,399
less represented

2513
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:58,239
um yeah he was special so good

2514
01:19:54,399 --> 01:20:00,000
do you uh take any inspiration from

2515
01:19:58,238 --> 01:20:01,119
let's talk about dagestan in general

2516
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:02,880
what do you what do you think makes

2517
01:20:01,119 --> 01:20:04,640
those wrestlers great yeah it's

2518
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:06,079
fascinating um have you read the book

2519
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,760
the talent code

2520
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:09,279
yeah it's great and that kind of talks

2521
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:10,880
about these talent hot spots all around

2522
01:20:09,279 --> 01:20:13,119
the world so now obviously with our

2523
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,760
wrestling academies we try to take some

2524
01:20:13,119 --> 01:20:17,519
lessons from that and apply it i got to

2525
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,920
assume they didn't cover dagestan in

2526
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:22,320
that book specifically but i gotta

2527
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,880
assume a lot of the same principles

2528
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:26,479
uh that are in that book apply to

2529
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,800
dagestan and wrestling right they did

2530
01:20:26,479 --> 01:20:31,039
south korea and um

2531
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,079
women's golf did curacao and baseball

2532
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:33,840
right they picked a lot of these other

2533
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:35,920
places that were really elite

2534
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:36,880
i think maybe moscow and women's tennis

2535
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,760
also

2536
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,480
um

2537
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,360
so

2538
01:20:38,479 --> 01:20:43,678
i think all these things that make any

2539
01:20:41,359 --> 01:20:45,359
group great organization is probably the

2540
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,760
same thing that's happening there well

2541
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,439
the hardship i mean what for is there

2542
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:50,880
something specific about wrestling that

2543
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:54,319
can

2544
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:56,480
create so many great champions is it

2545
01:20:54,319 --> 01:20:57,599
from that area so obviously they're all

2546
01:20:56,479 --> 01:20:58,799
they all

2547
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,639
love it like it's a big deal that

2548
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:02,079
wrestling is specifically is a big deal

2549
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:04,639
there you know they do [ __ ] also

2550
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:06,319
obviously um so that's part of his a lot

2551
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:09,039
of the kids are doing it the obviously a

2552
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:11,519
rough tumble tough tough life a lot of

2553
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:13,840
fights and then i think that also that a

2554
01:21:11,520 --> 01:21:15,040
lot of them it is a way out right there

2555
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,400
the the

2556
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:17,600
elite level athletes in that part of the

2557
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:19,759
world from my understanding are really

2558
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:21,120
well compensated compared to

2559
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,480
what the average person makes and

2560
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:24,399
they're treated really well so people

2561
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:26,559
see it as a way out whereas like and

2562
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:28,319
then honestly if

2563
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,400
america is getting better but in 2008

2564
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:31,679
the reason i went to mma was because

2565
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:32,960
i didn't want to be poor that my whole

2566
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,000
life yeah you know what i'm saying it

2567
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:35,920
sucks it's like well i don't want to

2568
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,158
make 20 000 for the next

2569
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:40,158
48 years so i'm going to go do something

2570
01:21:38,158 --> 01:21:41,359
else if i could have made even and i

2571
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:42,559
need to be rich right if i could have a

2572
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:43,839
hundred thousand dollars or seventy

2573
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:46,560
thousand dollars wrestling i probably

2574
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:48,880
probably kept wrestling um so i think i

2575
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:50,800
think it's those factors i and obviously

2576
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:52,400
now they have a really like

2577
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,239
uh a bunch of really good people in one

2578
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:55,439
area so it's probably and it's been

2579
01:21:54,238 --> 01:21:57,039
going on for a long time so there's

2580
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:58,638
probably been a bunch of like adults and

2581
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:00,719
coaches that are coming back and helping

2582
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:02,719
that progress so yeah a lot of those

2583
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:04,079
things that happen so i'm definitely

2584
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,679
going to travel there as i talk to him

2585
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,559
because i can speak russian it makes it

2586
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:11,119
makes it very um

2587
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:13,440
makes me uniquely qualified

2588
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:14,559
to uh

2589
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:16,879
my brother can speak a little bit

2590
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:19,199
russian your brother can yeah

2591
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:22,159
okay like a little bit like uh squares

2592
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:24,000
and no no no like he would

2593
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:24,879
oh man don't don't make me oversell i

2594
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,960
think he would be able to have a

2595
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:29,440
conversation with you i think okay

2596
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:31,198
okay probably not like you what's the uh

2597
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:32,399
what's the reason he knows right he i

2598
01:22:31,198 --> 01:22:34,158
don't know why he got obsessed with

2599
01:22:32,399 --> 01:22:35,119
languages and so his college degree is

2600
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:36,158
actually

2601
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:37,599
um

2602
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:39,599
what do they call inner discs where you

2603
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:41,920
have three minors who had a minor in

2604
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:45,120
russian a minor in

2605
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,960
a spanish and maybe japanese

2606
01:22:45,119 --> 01:22:48,479
i'm messing up it's definitely russian

2607
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:51,039
and spanish are for sure i don't know

2608
01:22:48,479 --> 01:22:53,198
what the third one is no but yeah

2609
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:55,840
it's it's really fascinating but the the

2610
01:22:53,198 --> 01:22:58,319
uh the emphasis on technique the lighter

2611
01:22:55,840 --> 01:23:00,719
drilling like they don't really go super

2612
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:02,559
hard yeah and i only spent a couple so i

2613
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:04,880
was there i was in vladikov cause in

2614
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:06,320
2008 that was where the world cup was we

2615
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,600
had to train there for like two days

2616
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:09,039
afterwards so

2617
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:11,520
um

2618
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:13,600
i didn't get to dig deep did

2619
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,600
dig deep into what was going on or

2620
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:18,639
anything but yeah i mean

2621
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:21,440
i think sparring has a sparring is very

2622
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:24,319
beneficial for wrestling um

2623
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:26,559
not like sparring mma is we fight right

2624
01:23:24,319 --> 01:23:28,799
sparring in wrestling is so i always

2625
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,719
just describe it to be really simple

2626
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,079
uh if we're drilling it's relatively

2627
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:33,679
zero percent resistance if we're going

2628
01:23:32,079 --> 01:23:35,439
as hard as we can that's 100 percent

2629
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:38,719
there's all this gray area in the middle

2630
01:23:35,439 --> 01:23:40,638
that's sparring right and so

2631
01:23:38,719 --> 01:23:42,079
you know if you have a good relationship

2632
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:43,600
like you know especially college me and

2633
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:45,439
my brother we could just go and we we

2634
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:46,880
know where each other's at we don't have

2635
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:49,119
to talk about it right but like in my

2636
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:52,239
wrestling club i'll say okay hey i want

2637
01:23:49,119 --> 01:23:53,840
you guys to go 50 in this position or i

2638
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:55,359
want the high crotch guy i want him to

2639
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,600
shoot and this is for him so i want him

2640
01:23:55,359 --> 01:23:58,960
to go 70 and defensive guy wants you to

2641
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,079
go 40. so you're not you're not supposed

2642
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:01,439
to be trying to win here you're going to

2643
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:03,760
go later i want you give it give them

2644
01:24:01,439 --> 01:24:04,799
some looks you know um so i think i

2645
01:24:03,760 --> 01:24:05,920
think it has really taken hold in

2646
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:08,159
america i think it's really beneficial

2647
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:09,440
for success and i think that's

2648
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:11,279
i mean america is doing better than

2649
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:13,198
we've ever done historically well that's

2650
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:15,359
70 and 40 that's like an art form to

2651
01:24:13,198 --> 01:24:17,039
find that right place because uh like

2652
01:24:15,359 --> 01:24:19,359
what the the really good people i've

2653
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:20,880
trained with they go

2654
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:22,639
much closer to 100

2655
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:25,119
speed wise

2656
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:27,359
or like but without

2657
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:29,119
like forcing things yeah you would when

2658
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:31,359
you're going it's some weird

2659
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:34,238
combination of things that like if you

2660
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:35,759
truly earn a technique

2661
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:38,238
then you're given that technique yeah

2662
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,119
yeah but like if you don't you don't

2663
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:41,759
yeah

2664
01:24:39,119 --> 01:24:43,519
and then it becomes a much less injury

2665
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:46,320
prone it becomes somehow more fun more

2666
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:48,320
dynamic you don't get stuck in positions

2667
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:50,000
it's just a lot of movement

2668
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:51,759
yeah the one thing so you you and john

2669
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:53,840
talked about the uh you know like

2670
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:55,520
different ways to learn and get better

2671
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:58,719
and so i think john obviously innovated

2672
01:24:55,520 --> 01:25:01,199
within the sport of jiu jitsu um

2673
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:03,359
and so for us one and maybe there's just

2674
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:05,119
a differentiator for us

2675
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,639
i think about it so excited to interrupt

2676
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:08,319
you have this academy you sent me this

2677
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:09,440
plan that you have like a really well

2678
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:12,000
thought through

2679
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:14,479
plan for how to develop a good wrestler

2680
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:16,800
so but so i think it's um

2681
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:19,039
so for me there's four categories right

2682
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,800
there's the teaching which is like you

2683
01:25:19,039 --> 01:25:22,560
don't know [ __ ] i'm you're coming in and

2684
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:23,840
i'm showing you the move and you're

2685
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,080
literally going out there and you're

2686
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:27,760
trying to me that's not even drilling

2687
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:29,359
that's like teaching like you're trying

2688
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:31,440
to learn something

2689
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:34,079
so obviously in someone's earlier

2690
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:35,519
periods they're spending a lot of time

2691
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:37,359
in that phase because they literally

2692
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,560
don't even know how to move their bodies

2693
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:40,079
the right way

2694
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:41,840
once you learn the skill then there's

2695
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,679
the drilling because you need to you

2696
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:45,199
absolutely have to get those reps to

2697
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,199
become really proficient in that

2698
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:49,919
movement and then the sparring and then

2699
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:52,000
the live right and so like i think

2700
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:52,880
obviously by the time you get to the

2701
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,198
kind of

2702
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:58,239
end point right but further on

2703
01:25:55,198 --> 01:25:59,759
the time you spent teaching is so i

2704
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:01,759
don't wanna say in i'm sorry in the

2705
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:03,199
learn learning teaching phase is not

2706
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,480
insignificant but so much smaller

2707
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:06,158
because to someone who's really good who

2708
01:26:04,479 --> 01:26:07,599
have coached for 10 years i don't have

2709
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:09,599
to give this big long drawn-out

2710
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,199
explanation i just have to say hey move

2711
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:12,880
move your hand a little differently

2712
01:26:11,198 --> 01:26:14,559
right or just do this yeah right we

2713
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,400
don't spend any time there so i think

2714
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,880
that's like something that consumes for

2715
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:21,599
the younger kids say five through 12 or

2716
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,679
13 we're consuming a massive amount of

2717
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,639
time there on that teaching learning

2718
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:27,679
phase

2719
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:29,920
and then as we get older that time wanes

2720
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:30,960
a lot but that makes total sense right

2721
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:32,719
yeah

2722
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,399
it's funny because when you look at like

2723
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,239
jiu jitsu schools

2724
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:38,319
they spend a lot of time in the teaching

2725
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:39,519
learning and then the live

2726
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:40,880
it feels like there's not enough

2727
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,760
drilling i like how you draw a

2728
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:44,960
distinction there because it feels

2729
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,960
it feels like you're always starting

2730
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:49,119
from scratch like people have like very

2731
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,960
crappy short-term memory like they

2732
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:53,039
they're not uh

2733
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:54,960
like the way teaching is done is you

2734
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:57,519
show a technique from scratch

2735
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,639
and i just it seems disjoint it is for

2736
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,080
sure especially if you have a class

2737
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:01,359
that's been with you for a while yeah

2738
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:02,880
you don't have to start from scratch you

2739
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:05,519
can say hey let's focus on this one

2740
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:07,279
little thing here yeah or let's after we

2741
01:27:05,520 --> 01:27:09,199
do this let's do that you know you kind

2742
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:11,198
of put start putting it all together and

2743
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:12,158
then with jiu jitsu the thing that i i

2744
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:13,839
really

2745
01:27:12,158 --> 01:27:16,158
struggled with was was a couple things

2746
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:18,800
it was um and this is not speaking for

2747
01:27:16,158 --> 01:27:20,479
all the gyms my personal experience

2748
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,400
through the sport and i actually found

2749
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:23,839
my so when i unretired i found someone

2750
01:27:22,399 --> 01:27:25,198
really great that i loved and i really

2751
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:26,800
wish it was mark layman i don't know if

2752
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:29,039
you know him at all i wish i would have

2753
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,199
found him earlier because he was just

2754
01:27:29,039 --> 01:27:32,560
tremendous um

2755
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:34,960
but number one there's no drilling so

2756
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:37,199
it's like in wrestling i can boil down

2757
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,198
to

2758
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:42,639
i can probably name you the best six

2759
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:44,079
moves right so we need as younger people

2760
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:46,000
single leg right same leg's gonna be the

2761
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:47,519
most proficient takedown it always has

2762
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,039
been i don't know probably always will

2763
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:51,280
be unless there figures out something

2764
01:27:49,039 --> 01:27:52,800
different um

2765
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:54,000
the robot the robot figures i'm

2766
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,440
different we're going to shoot the last

2767
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,319
single legs why because we're getting

2768
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:57,439
because everyone's going to do that

2769
01:27:56,319 --> 01:27:59,039
right we're going to shoot a lot of

2770
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:01,039
single eggs so

2771
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:03,359
just like say an armbar or some type of

2772
01:28:01,039 --> 01:28:05,279
sweep right why can't we go get 50 reps

2773
01:28:03,359 --> 01:28:06,719
there hey we i mean by the time i've

2774
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:08,319
been in your jiu jitsu school for two

2775
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:10,399
years i better know a [ __ ] arm bar i

2776
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:11,679
better know what so don't don't spend 10

2777
01:28:10,399 --> 01:28:13,759
minutes teaching me just tell me to go

2778
01:28:11,679 --> 01:28:15,679
hit 50 reps and then if when i'm hitting

2779
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,760
my reps if there's something i'm doing

2780
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:19,440
wrong then just say hey ben

2781
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:20,960
move your leg a little bit that way or

2782
01:28:19,439 --> 01:28:23,198
raise your hips up a little more right

2783
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,560
like correct as you're drilling so

2784
01:28:23,198 --> 01:28:26,399
you're getting all these reps at it so

2785
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:27,440
you're becoming more proficient and then

2786
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:29,679
the other thing i really struggled with

2787
01:28:27,439 --> 01:28:31,198
was to your point during

2788
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:32,800
live so many times it's just this five

2789
01:28:31,198 --> 01:28:34,319
minute go go

2790
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,639
go and that's not the most efficient way

2791
01:28:34,319 --> 01:28:38,158
to learn because when you have two

2792
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:40,480
people especially when they're focused

2793
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:42,238
on winning and you say go they're gonna

2794
01:28:40,479 --> 01:28:43,599
go to whatever they do best well if i'm

2795
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:44,879
trying to make you good at something i

2796
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,719
don't want you doing what you do best

2797
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,560
all the time i need you doing some other

2798
01:28:46,719 --> 01:28:49,679
things right if you have a great single

2799
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:51,120
leg but you can't shoot to the other

2800
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:52,719
side of the body

2801
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:54,479
we need to work on that right right you

2802
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:56,639
need to start shooting the other side

2803
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:58,638
there's some sense that you it's not

2804
01:28:56,639 --> 01:29:00,639
like you should be told what to work on

2805
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:02,560
but you should be told to work on the

2806
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,400
thing that you want to work on meaning

2807
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,000
because i i don't know but maybe you can

2808
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:07,920
comment on this but you know everybody

2809
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:10,000
develops a different game as you get

2810
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:11,760
better and better there's a set of

2811
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,399
things you need to be working on so i

2812
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:16,960
actually have uh like when i especially

2813
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:18,638
when i'm like training very seriously

2814
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:21,198
i'll have

2815
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:22,719
a specific technique to have in mind and

2816
01:29:21,198 --> 01:29:24,799
i have a

2817
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,719
sheet of paper on the side

2818
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,800
where i literally my head keep count off

2819
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,239
how many times i put myself in that

2820
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,400
position and pulled off the technique

2821
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:34,000
and that's all i care about yeah in like

2822
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:35,519
training so i'll just

2823
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:38,319
uh uh whatever it is if it's a

2824
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:41,120
guillotine cigarette arm drag arm drag

2825
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:42,880
but i want to make sure i don't

2826
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:46,238
i love numbers so

2827
01:29:42,880 --> 01:29:48,239
i'll say like uh i'll make sure i get 50

2828
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:50,399
arm drags yeah and i'm not getting off

2829
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:52,959
the mat until i do and that you know if

2830
01:29:50,399 --> 01:29:54,879
it takes thrilling our live contest uh

2831
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:56,880
so in this in the thing i'm describing

2832
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:59,760
right now is the live contest

2833
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:01,520
but drilling obviously drilling

2834
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:03,280
so i feel like i can't find a drilling

2835
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:06,080
part like it's so hard to find drilling

2836
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:07,920
partners even so boring it's it's

2837
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:09,920
annoying to me that this is boring and

2838
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,760
there's nothing more annoying to me than

2839
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:13,600
the look of boredom on another person's

2840
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,719
face when we're drawing yeah it's like

2841
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:16,400
do you really think drilling is that

2842
01:30:14,719 --> 01:30:18,719
beneficial to you because you said it to

2843
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:20,399
josh yes yes he thinks i'm an idiot but

2844
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:22,560
yes why

2845
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:24,158
why am i am i an idiot or why not really

2846
01:30:22,560 --> 01:30:26,800
beneficial

2847
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:28,479
uh let's go with suture explicit

2848
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,320
why is it so beneficial

2849
01:30:28,479 --> 01:30:31,359
um

2850
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:34,079
i think

2851
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:36,880
for me it's there's a meditative aspect

2852
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:39,119
to it where the more you drill

2853
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,079
the more you start noticing

2854
01:30:39,119 --> 01:30:41,760
the

2855
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:43,519
the details okay let me let me pull my

2856
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,719
new details a little bit here

2857
01:30:43,520 --> 01:30:46,719
i'm not gonna push back all the way

2858
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:48,000
because um so every time if i was

2859
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:50,000
wrestling i won't

2860
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:51,840
crash something like whatever right but

2861
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:54,880
even so say like at a high level when

2862
01:30:51,840 --> 01:30:56,880
i'm really wrestling 10 years ago um

2863
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,000
even during that drill portion if we

2864
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:01,600
talk about the resistance of our

2865
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:03,679
opponent from zero to 100 um

2866
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,639
it's very likely that my partner at that

2867
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:05,920
point because people i'm really

2868
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:07,359
comfortable with they're probably at

2869
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:08,560
least going 20 or 30 right they're

2870
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:10,880
probably giving me a certain look with

2871
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,400
the sprawl or you know i got to get

2872
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:13,840
through their hands if i if i don't set

2873
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:16,799
it up right they might put their arm

2874
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:18,400
down right so it's like we are drilling

2875
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:19,920
because we're wrestling at a really low

2876
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:21,839
resistance level but there's a little

2877
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:23,679
bit of sparring oh yeah

2878
01:31:21,840 --> 01:31:25,119
between yeah yeah yeah so that's not

2879
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:26,719
really drilling because i think a

2880
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:28,559
drilling i think literally you're

2881
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:30,880
shooting and i'm just going to boom your

2882
01:31:28,560 --> 01:31:30,880
dummy

2883
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:34,319
it's very hard to be a dummy that

2884
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:36,079
doesn't do twenty percent so you're

2885
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:37,920
gonna do twenty percent yeah that's so

2886
01:31:36,079 --> 01:31:39,920
so yes that's twenty percent but that's

2887
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:41,600
like sparring a little bit then

2888
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:43,440
no but they're not really resisting

2889
01:31:41,600 --> 01:31:45,199
they're just giving you the right frame

2890
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:47,119
they're they're giving you the right

2891
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:49,839
like movement and they're being they're

2892
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:51,119
being an intelligent dummy essentially i

2893
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,560
mean

2894
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:53,920
but also like the really important

2895
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,320
component of this is you pick the

2896
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:59,440
techniques for which it's beneficial if

2897
01:31:56,319 --> 01:32:01,920
the technique is has dynamic elements to

2898
01:31:59,439 --> 01:32:05,359
it you don't want to be doing that with

2899
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,520
i'm saying like there's certain moves

2900
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:09,359
and i like those moves and i select the

2901
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:10,639
game based on those moves

2902
01:32:09,359 --> 01:32:12,719
are you drilling to get better are you

2903
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:14,319
drawing just to work out no to get

2904
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,399
better that's what i'm trying to tell

2905
01:32:14,319 --> 01:32:19,039
you i i believe you can become like

2906
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:20,479
exceptionally good very fast by drilling

2907
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:22,158
but how

2908
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:23,439
but

2909
01:32:22,158 --> 01:32:25,359
first of all let me let me ask you an

2910
01:32:23,439 --> 01:32:27,599
empirical question let me

2911
01:32:25,359 --> 01:32:29,519
have you actually drilled

2912
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,679
ten thousand times that's gonna move

2913
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,040
millions

2914
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:34,639
you haven't drilled millions hundreds of

2915
01:32:33,039 --> 01:32:36,639
thousands hundreds of thousands likely i

2916
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:38,079
think you're just saying numbers

2917
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:40,000
i don't think you know what a hundred

2918
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:41,760
thousand it's way more ten thousand i

2919
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,039
don't think it's over a hundred thousand

2920
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:44,480
there was a ten year period where i

2921
01:32:43,039 --> 01:32:46,560
wrestled every single day that's yeah

2922
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:47,919
that's uh three thousand days so you're

2923
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,280
telling me ten thousand that's only

2924
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:50,560
three of them a day i did way more than

2925
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:51,840
that

2926
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,600
three of them probably had 30 of them a

2927
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:56,079
day that's that's a hundred thousand

2928
01:32:53,600 --> 01:32:58,400
yeah yeah hundreds of thousands i'm i

2929
01:32:56,079 --> 01:33:00,479
doubt you get 30 a day for i did four i

2930
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:01,920
am for sure 100

2931
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:03,439
there's no doubt all right because some

2932
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,600
days i might do a hundred

2933
01:33:03,439 --> 01:33:07,359
right so 30 30 is not very many

2934
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,760
especially if we count all reps if we're

2935
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:11,519
counting drilling and live so like our

2936
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:13,600
coach college choices make us just drill

2937
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:14,800
a lot and i always hated it so i would i

2938
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:15,920
would rebel and just kind of give a

2939
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,279
little spar you know you shoot a high

2940
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:18,560
crotch we'll start you know coach wants

2941
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:19,920
to draw high grounds okay we'll start

2942
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,520
you shoot the high crotch that's great

2943
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:22,880
then i'm gonna sit the corner i'm gonna

2944
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,560
give you my hip or i'm gonna you know

2945
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:26,719
i'm gonna try something so then you have

2946
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,760
to react and i would argue that

2947
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:29,359
um

2948
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:32,159
all skill level

2949
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:34,399
past like the beginner stuff is is some

2950
01:33:32,158 --> 01:33:36,319
necessity of that right i'm gonna do

2951
01:33:34,399 --> 01:33:37,679
this then what are you gonna do it's

2952
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:38,719
it's back and forth i should just sing

2953
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:41,119
like what are you gonna do i should

2954
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:42,639
highlight 20 you and you have to start

2955
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:43,760
unconsciously programming these things

2956
01:33:42,639 --> 01:33:44,800
in your head because if you consciously

2957
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,920
think about it it's going to be too slow

2958
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:47,760
to actually hit in a matter but the

2959
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:49,679
drilling is the unconscious programming

2960
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:51,440
but but the simple movement the

2961
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:53,440
the first simple movement the first

2962
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:55,839
simple movement that single leg or the

2963
01:33:53,439 --> 01:33:57,039
high crotch or arm j whatever

2964
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,119
like

2965
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:00,960
i feel like the amount you're going to

2966
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:02,158
get better at it is so miniscule

2967
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:05,600
compared to the amount you're going to

2968
01:34:02,158 --> 01:34:08,559
gain at doing other things around it

2969
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:10,880
no but that's the key word you feel

2970
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,880
okay that's your opinion if we did if we

2971
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:14,560
did a study on it that i would be proven

2972
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,279
correct no

2973
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:19,520
perhaps so first of all your brain as an

2974
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:22,238
exceptionally creative

2975
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:25,040
combat athlete it's clear that you don't

2976
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:26,799
like the boredom of drilling like it's

2977
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:28,719
obvious that you that you have like

2978
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:31,199
you're such a creative energy that

2979
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:33,119
you're just not going to be somebody

2980
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:34,399
who's going to enjoy that so enjoyment

2981
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:36,000
is probably

2982
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:38,479
having an active mind is really

2983
01:34:36,000 --> 01:34:40,399
important so the the the question is do

2984
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:41,678
you have the kind of makeup that has an

2985
01:34:40,399 --> 01:34:45,359
active mind

2986
01:34:41,679 --> 01:34:46,880
during a drilling on a dummy and i have

2987
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:49,279
that mind

2988
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:51,199
like yeah you really think okay so if

2989
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:53,118
you're uh let's pick a technique what

2990
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:54,719
technique do you want to draw a lot

2991
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:56,960
i was doing jiu jitsu or wrestling

2992
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:58,480
whatever you want um

2993
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:01,039
it's hard to describe with words but

2994
01:34:58,479 --> 01:35:04,158
certain guard passes uh let me let me

2995
01:35:01,039 --> 01:35:06,639
think just guar pass okay so you have a

2996
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:08,399
card pass and you get it to be as a 9.5

2997
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,920
out of 10 right just from a from a

2998
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:11,679
technical standpoint

2999
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:13,920
don't you think you need some resistance

3000
01:35:11,679 --> 01:35:16,800
to feel because essentially all all

3001
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,239
benefit after that is going to be what

3002
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:20,000
are they going to try to do to me if

3003
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:22,000
they shift that way do i need to i need

3004
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,960
a single year or move there so it's like

3005
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,359
i so i i actually think we're agreeing

3006
01:35:24,960 --> 01:35:29,198
but maybe terminology wise well the

3007
01:35:27,359 --> 01:35:30,479
split is the important thing like how

3008
01:35:29,198 --> 01:35:32,879
much of each

3009
01:35:30,479 --> 01:35:35,039
so i think it is spar i i think it's a

3010
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:37,039
very light touch bar is what you're

3011
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:39,279
talking about which is in my opinion

3012
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:41,519
really isn't drilling and it's because

3013
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:43,279
drilling past the basic proficiency i

3014
01:35:41,520 --> 01:35:44,560
don't think brings much value but that's

3015
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:45,759
what i'm trying to tell you is i think

3016
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:49,280
it does

3017
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,280
i think i think um

3018
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:54,719
if you're doing that same movement i

3019
01:35:51,840 --> 01:35:56,159
think you begin to learn more over time

3020
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:57,679
like you're saying like once you get the

3021
01:35:56,158 --> 01:36:00,000
basic proficiency

3022
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,440
then there's uh diminishing returns i

3023
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,198
don't yeah so that's what i think i

3024
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:05,439
don't think so i think everything has

3025
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:06,960
diminishing returns when you're learning

3026
01:36:05,439 --> 01:36:10,559
a technique but with something as

3027
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:12,880
complex as wrestling or grappling um if

3028
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:16,560
if you can have way more gains over here

3029
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:18,719
why focus on going from a 9.7 to a 9.8

3030
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,320
if you if this other area if you're

3031
01:36:18,719 --> 01:36:22,000
spending so much time here that there's

3032
01:36:20,319 --> 01:36:23,840
other areas left unexplored you can make

3033
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,039
gigantic gains over there no but you're

3034
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:27,920
going to lose

3035
01:36:25,039 --> 01:36:30,479
i i think a lot depends on your style i

3036
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:33,039
think a lot is determined by

3037
01:36:30,479 --> 01:36:35,198
how good you are at one thing

3038
01:36:33,039 --> 01:36:37,118
and so if you want to become a master of

3039
01:36:35,198 --> 01:36:38,799
a particular thing and then make your

3040
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:41,439
whole game where it's all pulled into

3041
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:43,679
that system then i don't know if one is

3042
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:46,158
too small of a number not yeah it's

3043
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:47,760
small i i feel like you can't be easily

3044
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:49,118
this like

3045
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,119
yeah you want you want a funnel you want

3046
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:52,158
to create funnels funnels funnels right

3047
01:36:51,118 --> 01:36:54,479
where everything goes into a few

3048
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:56,960
positions and then it's all fields

3049
01:36:54,479 --> 01:36:59,359
yeah yeah but i feel

3050
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:00,399
that you can get like

3051
01:36:59,359 --> 01:37:02,238
drilling

3052
01:37:00,399 --> 01:37:05,359
on a dummy

3053
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:08,479
80 of the time and 20 of the time live

3054
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:10,479
rolling with people worse than you

3055
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:12,238
like a little bit worse than you or a

3056
01:37:10,479 --> 01:37:15,039
lot worse yeah so i think so i think i

3057
01:37:12,238 --> 01:37:15,839
definitely think so my my build up would

3058
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:17,359
be

3059
01:37:15,840 --> 01:37:19,119
um

3060
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:21,198
teach so we're talking complex technique

3061
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:23,118
right so by the time we're talking about

3062
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:25,519
we'll say a late high school kid who's

3063
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:28,079
pretty proficient um he's probably done

3064
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:29,679
the drilling part so then now it's like

3065
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:31,519
okay if i want to get something new to

3066
01:37:29,679 --> 01:37:33,118
you i'll probably tell you you'll

3067
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,639
probably do the basic premise within

3068
01:37:33,118 --> 01:37:37,039
five to ten minutes if they're good

3069
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:38,960
right do this okay they do it then it's

3070
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:40,079
like okay so now here from here what

3071
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:41,520
we're going to do we're going to go

3072
01:37:40,079 --> 01:37:42,800
light sparring so i know you have

3073
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,320
success because i need you to complete

3074
01:37:42,800 --> 01:37:45,279
the task in order to get better at

3075
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:46,799
that's something a lot of people in

3076
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:48,158
wrestling mess up is they just want to

3077
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,279
go the toughest person but if you're the

3078
01:37:48,158 --> 01:37:50,719
toughest person

3079
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:52,479
you're not going to actually execute on

3080
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:54,000
any skills you're getting your workout

3081
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:55,279
being and i need you to execute because

3082
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,800
i need to get good at this in order to

3083
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:58,238
get good you have to get all the way

3084
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:00,159
through the tech why do you need them to

3085
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:02,479
complete just so they gain confidence in

3086
01:38:00,158 --> 01:38:05,118
the technique or they go they have to

3087
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:06,479
feel all the way through like if i said

3088
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:07,679
learn a high crotch

3089
01:38:06,479 --> 01:38:09,839
when you're drilling with stop halfway

3090
01:38:07,679 --> 01:38:10,880
every time but you're not actually gonna

3091
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:12,560
be able to do it because you're gonna

3092
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:14,639
stop you're gonna feel

3093
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,880
so you know try it on someone spar

3094
01:38:14,639 --> 01:38:19,279
lightly get it do it on someone who's

3095
01:38:16,880 --> 01:38:20,560
not as good you get it then kind of work

3096
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:21,840
your way up the ladder until you can get

3097
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:24,159
it on someone your own skill level or

3098
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:26,239
maybe better than you right in in a live

3099
01:38:24,158 --> 01:38:28,319
competition so it's like i don't know i

3100
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:29,919
feel like that that basic drilling like

3101
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:31,679
um so a kid like keegan who i brought a

3102
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,440
few times like i feel like if there's

3103
01:38:31,679 --> 01:38:34,800
something new i could literally tell him

3104
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:36,719
like this is what i want you to do and

3105
01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:38,560
he's such a great feel like he could go

3106
01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:40,000
drill it proficiently within probably a

3107
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,679
minute or two

3108
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:43,039
but then to hit it on someone high level

3109
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:45,520
that's going to take

3110
01:38:43,039 --> 01:38:47,279
quite a while longer and that's a mix of

3111
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,280
drilling and

3112
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:51,439
sparring on people a little bit worse

3113
01:38:49,279 --> 01:38:53,599
than you yeah and then better yeah then

3114
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:54,960
equal and then better yeah okay yeah

3115
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,560
because there's there's there's this

3116
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,239
with with grappling right there's such

3117
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:59,840
like a feel component to the the

3118
01:38:58,238 --> 01:39:01,678
pressure the movement and all these

3119
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,199
things and there's still like there's so

3120
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:04,960
many things you can throw at someone out

3121
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:06,559
of one position

3122
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:09,840
not just moves but moves a different

3123
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:11,679
level of force or or whatever

3124
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:14,719
are you and these kids developing like a

3125
01:39:11,679 --> 01:39:15,920
big picture strategy of like

3126
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,198
what are the

3127
01:39:15,920 --> 01:39:19,359
main

3128
01:39:17,198 --> 01:39:20,879
setups and takedowns and just like a

3129
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:23,198
whole system

3130
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:25,199
um so we you know i kind of sent you our

3131
01:39:23,198 --> 01:39:27,359
technique book right and how we kind of

3132
01:39:25,198 --> 01:39:30,960
go and approach it so i think in

3133
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:32,719
wrestling you're going to need

3134
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,800
you're going to need a handful of things

3135
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:36,000
just off the off the word go right

3136
01:39:34,800 --> 01:39:37,520
you're going to

3137
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,960
so i think on our feet i need to build

3138
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:40,800
take this out of the body i need to

3139
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,079
build attack that side of the body i

3140
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,480
need to be able to bring you underneath

3141
01:39:42,079 --> 01:39:45,840
me i need to be able to go around you

3142
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:47,519
right now we can accomplish those

3143
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:48,880
different ways but we should have all

3144
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,639
those weapons if we want to be really

3145
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,560
good some way right

3146
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:54,159
um so if i neglect one of those so if i

3147
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:56,880
neglect the abilities they pull you down

3148
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:58,559
right from headlock you um now if i have

3149
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:00,400
a good shot and you're smart you're just

3150
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:02,320
going to lower your stance so my shot is

3151
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:04,000
not going to be as successful and i have

3152
01:40:02,319 --> 01:40:06,079
the inability to pull you down right so

3153
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,760
i kind of need all of those so i can as

3154
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:08,559
they get better i can point those things

3155
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:11,440
out

3156
01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:13,440
um on bottom my folks out bottom there's

3157
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:15,198
certain things like you have to be good

3158
01:40:13,439 --> 01:40:16,559
at leg ride defense

3159
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:17,919
right you have to i mean

3160
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,280
at a high level or you're just go you're

3161
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:20,560
gonna get when you get it in you're just

3162
01:40:19,279 --> 01:40:23,599
getting stuck there not gonna be able to

3163
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:25,039
escape um but besides that yeah there's

3164
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:27,199
a there's a multitude of things you can

3165
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:29,840
choose from and i'm gonna depending on

3166
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:31,118
your body style uh and what you're good

3167
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:32,480
and bad at i'm gonna probably develop

3168
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:34,399
something a little different i might

3169
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:37,279
give you hey you do the quad pod you'd

3170
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:38,158
be better with a knee slide whatever

3171
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:40,479
um

3172
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:42,799
yeah and top kind of same thing

3173
01:40:40,479 --> 01:40:45,359
i have to ask you about khabib so i

3174
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:47,679
remember a while ago rogan said that uh

3175
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:51,279
that's the perfect fight uh

3176
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:53,199
yeah it could be you are so let me ask

3177
01:40:51,279 --> 01:40:55,118
two questions the first

3178
01:40:53,198 --> 01:40:57,519
do you think you can beat him in an mma

3179
01:40:55,118 --> 01:40:59,279
match when you're at your peak yeah i i

3180
01:40:57,520 --> 01:41:00,560
don't like uh yeah i mean this is one of

3181
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:02,238
those people where people like will get

3182
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,000
really mad at me if i say yes but yeah i

3183
01:41:02,238 --> 01:41:07,198
mean how would you do it how would you

3184
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:09,198
solve that puzzle yeah uh

3185
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:10,799
i mean we would grapple and i think i

3186
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:13,039
would be better than him but you know i

3187
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:15,600
i feel weird saying because people like

3188
01:41:13,039 --> 01:41:17,600
yeah i write your [ __ ] you know and

3189
01:41:15,600 --> 01:41:19,920
but that's no no one out grappled them

3190
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:22,560
right i mean nobody did and maybe i'm

3191
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:24,480
wrong on this but i if we will get the

3192
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:25,920
best possible candidates i'm definitely

3193
01:41:24,479 --> 01:41:28,479
one of them and obviously i have a small

3194
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:30,719
size advantage too

3195
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:32,638
so in a wrestling match so we can just

3196
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:33,920
reduce that mma match to a wrestling

3197
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,159
match what do you think is the right

3198
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,679
strategy on him like do you understand

3199
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:38,479
his style that

3200
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:40,399
the

3201
01:41:38,479 --> 01:41:42,079
the the his wrestling style the pressure

3202
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:43,920
he applies do you understand yeah how

3203
01:41:42,079 --> 01:41:45,039
the hell he makes it happen

3204
01:41:43,920 --> 01:41:48,000
yeah i mean

3205
01:41:45,039 --> 01:41:49,679
he never unfortunately fought any real

3206
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:50,880
who i would say really really high level

3207
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:52,239
wrestlers i was actually really

3208
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:53,679
disappointed how bad justin gaich's

3209
01:41:52,238 --> 01:41:55,519
wrestling was because just engage he had

3210
01:41:53,679 --> 01:41:57,359
some solid success

3211
01:41:55,520 --> 01:42:00,400
but justin was really bad in that fight

3212
01:41:57,359 --> 01:42:02,559
um gaetje has success at uh

3213
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:04,238
yeah i think he was seventh place

3214
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:06,960
maybe or so somewhere he was definitely

3215
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:08,799
all american uh it was lower though

3216
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:10,319
um

3217
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,000
so yeah i would i would like to see how

3218
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:13,599
he dealt with someone who was like who i

3219
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,359
think oh man this guy's a really high

3220
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,639
level wrestler because you know we saw

3221
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:18,238
and this is early in his career but you

3222
01:42:16,639 --> 01:42:20,960
know grayson tebow did give him some

3223
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:22,238
issues earlier in his career um

3224
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:23,600
so i would like to see him in that

3225
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:25,359
situation and see how he does i would

3226
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,880
love to like you know i i just love

3227
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:29,039
wrestling and grappling like yeah i'd

3228
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:30,800
love this someone said hey ben

3229
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:32,399
you know khabib wants to roll with you

3230
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,840
okay i'm there tomorrow it sounds like a

3231
01:42:32,399 --> 01:42:35,839
blast let's go

3232
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,639
it's probably competitive as hell

3233
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:38,480
yeah

3234
01:42:36,639 --> 01:42:40,079
you're still competitive i know when to

3235
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:41,919
be and when not to be like you know say

3236
01:42:40,079 --> 01:42:44,238
if i'm going to high school kids they're

3237
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:46,000
not going to be competitive because

3238
01:42:44,238 --> 01:42:48,079
then i'm just being a dick how would you

3239
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:49,840
take him down

3240
01:42:48,079 --> 01:42:51,279
what what i'm a real wrestler like

3241
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:52,960
wrestling wrestling wrestling wrestling

3242
01:42:51,279 --> 01:42:55,599
i would probably try to text single eggs

3243
01:42:52,960 --> 01:42:57,600
and stuff sing legs yeah

3244
01:42:55,600 --> 01:42:59,920
i haven't okay

3245
01:42:57,600 --> 01:43:01,199
no no i mean i have no i've honestly i

3246
01:42:59,920 --> 01:43:03,279
don't have the slightest clue i'd have

3247
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:04,879
to feel i'd feel them out um but single

3248
01:43:03,279 --> 01:43:06,800
leg's my best takeaway people talk about

3249
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:09,039
his wrestling being really good the

3250
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:12,159
people that train with him so okay so i

3251
01:43:09,039 --> 01:43:14,560
i grilled someone i will not say who on

3252
01:43:12,158 --> 01:43:15,920
the ed ruth think ed ruth is very elite

3253
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,600
at folk style wrestling he never became

3254
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:19,840
that great at fighting unfortunately

3255
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,119
wait ed ruth wrestled khabib they were

3256
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:22,880
on the same team for a while yeah okay

3257
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:25,599
and there was rumors that could be beat

3258
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:27,760
him up and i said i

3259
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,360
sure can't believe that and i've heard

3260
01:43:27,760 --> 01:43:30,960
that that was

3261
01:43:29,359 --> 01:43:33,039
if they were just straight wrestling ed

3262
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:35,279
would get slightly the better of it well

3263
01:43:33,039 --> 01:43:36,840
edwards is like one of the greats he's

3264
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:39,359
great he's really good

3265
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:42,239
yeah so that was what i heard

3266
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:45,359
but in an mma setting because of all the

3267
01:43:42,238 --> 01:43:46,559
tools that khabib would get them

3268
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:48,880
i don't know

3269
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:50,159
but it what but i agree i agree with

3270
01:43:48,880 --> 01:43:51,600
rogan on this one that would have been

3271
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:53,839
good to see yeah i'm fine so yeah if

3272
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:56,159
kaby wants to work out i'd love it i

3273
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:57,520
love i love wrestling and grappling i

3274
01:43:56,158 --> 01:43:59,118
don't do much juju because i don't have

3275
01:43:57,520 --> 01:44:00,800
time for it anymore i'm at the wrestling

3276
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:03,039
academy like every single day

3277
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:04,800
uh but yeah i i love jiu jitsu while i

3278
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:06,079
did it and you know if i didn't have

3279
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:08,000
wrestling cameras i probably would still

3280
01:44:06,079 --> 01:44:10,559
be doing jiu jitsu yeah you did well and

3281
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:12,000
you just as well but

3282
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:14,000
let me ask you a ridiculous question

3283
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:17,439
who's the greatest of all time freestyle

3284
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:20,319
or folk style oh wrestling wrestling hmm

3285
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:22,799
well i i will say my knowledge past like

3286
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:24,399
the year 2000 is

3287
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,679
really

3288
01:44:24,399 --> 01:44:27,920
not that great because you can which

3289
01:44:25,679 --> 01:44:29,118
direction sorry after 2000 no before

3290
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:30,800
because you can't find any film or

3291
01:44:29,118 --> 01:44:32,399
anything you know and so you hear

3292
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,840
involvement so you need evidence you

3293
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:35,279
need direct evidence i want to be able

3294
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,960
to watch them and see them and feel the

3295
01:44:35,279 --> 01:44:39,279
times and feel their opponents and you

3296
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,840
know all those things to really like i i

3297
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:42,639
hate giving bad answers you know so um i

3298
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:44,159
would

3299
01:44:42,639 --> 01:44:45,679
i there's just not enough footage of any

3300
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:47,599
of those people you know we go back to

3301
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:48,960
someone like alexander medved

3302
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,119
like you can't find footage you can't

3303
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:52,719
find anything on him you know it's like

3304
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:53,839
who is he wrestling you know i'm not

3305
01:44:52,719 --> 01:44:54,800
sure so

3306
01:44:53,840 --> 01:44:57,199
um

3307
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:59,440
post 2000 i think and also just

3308
01:44:57,198 --> 01:45:02,559
freestyle so

3309
01:44:59,439 --> 01:45:04,638
um americans right it's just the tf has

3310
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,400
the probably the best argument posted i

3311
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:08,960
think said july of um if you guys have

3312
01:45:06,399 --> 01:45:11,198
the russian tank that guys yeah yeah so

3313
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:12,800
who's who's better snyder or such alive

3314
01:45:11,198 --> 01:45:14,238
so sigil i just wanted the olympics i

3315
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:16,800
understand this i understand how that

3316
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:18,879
works but there's pretty close right

3317
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:21,119
not really not not that much but in

3318
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:23,359
general the match up so well so kyle won

3319
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:25,118
the first one in 17 said july i have

3320
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:28,880
pinned him the following year but then

3321
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:30,639
kyle lost and took bronze in 19 um and

3322
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,560
then just lost i don't want i don't want

3323
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:34,319
to say fairly decisively but it was it

3324
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:36,320
was six to three and that there was a

3325
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:37,198
late takedown he kind of gave it up and

3326
01:45:36,319 --> 01:45:38,399
maybe

3327
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:40,799
feels really competitive maybe he

3328
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:42,638
wouldn't have um

3329
01:45:40,800 --> 01:45:45,679
they're gonna wrestle again in like two

3330
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:46,960
weeks here so that you know yeah i mean

3331
01:45:45,679 --> 01:45:48,960
you have to say said july at this point

3332
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,719
there's nothing else to say unless kyle

3333
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:52,800
proves us otherwise

3334
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:55,359
yeah not enough people talk about said

3335
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:57,360
you're live okay why

3336
01:45:55,359 --> 01:45:59,198
you think that guy should go to mma i

3337
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:00,799
think kyle should go to mma some of

3338
01:45:59,198 --> 01:46:01,839
these guys yeah they're making enough

3339
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:03,440
money in wrestling where they don't

3340
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:05,039
really feel the need to it's just

3341
01:46:03,439 --> 01:46:07,599
terrifying though it's a heavy weight

3342
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:09,279
such a life would probably it's like

3343
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,159
it's like could be but heavy weight well

3344
01:46:09,279 --> 01:46:13,359
i don't know if you remember do you

3345
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:14,799
remember bill mahoff sabilal makhov

3346
01:46:13,359 --> 01:46:16,880
actually was the russian representative

3347
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:18,719
in both styles in 2016 gregoire and

3348
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:21,118
freestyle um

3349
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:22,800
and he was to my knowledge the only

3350
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:25,039
person the ufc's ever signed that was

3351
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:26,560
zero and z in modern era signed that was

3352
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:28,158
zero and zero and then he actually never

3353
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,600
ended up fighting

3354
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:31,839
but weird right

3355
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:32,719
so yeah my motivation i i don't know i

3356
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:34,639
don't know what the story is because

3357
01:46:32,719 --> 01:46:36,319
sometimes out of russia i mean maybe

3358
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:37,920
better sources than i do sometimes it

3359
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:39,279
feels like dudes just disappear like

3360
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:41,118
they're a world champ or a little big

3361
01:46:39,279 --> 01:46:41,840
champion i'll say you're like wait i

3362
01:46:41,118 --> 01:46:43,679
didn't

3363
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,600
where'd he go you talked [ __ ] about

3364
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:48,239
russia earlier in the conversation so

3365
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:49,840
what'd i say i i forgot but i think

3366
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:51,839
steroids i think somebody's gonna show

3367
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:53,840
up to your door i'm worried i honestly

3368
01:46:51,840 --> 01:46:55,440
i've said enough bad things where i

3369
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:56,800
would be you know kind of looking over

3370
01:46:55,439 --> 01:46:58,559
my shoulder if i went to the science or

3371
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:01,279
something

3372
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:02,800
uh i for one love the russians what

3373
01:47:01,279 --> 01:47:04,158
about icarus

3374
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,320
how does that make you feel what about

3375
01:47:04,158 --> 01:47:09,559
it it's fake news oh really i'm just

3376
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:09,559
kidding it's

3377
01:47:10,238 --> 01:47:13,439
yeah

3378
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,679
you know it's troublesome man i hate

3379
01:47:13,439 --> 01:47:18,000
cheating in all of its forms

3380
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:20,639
uh any other like recaps from the

3381
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,238
olympics of uh 2020 tokyo that stood out

3382
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:25,760
to you gable stevenson like anything

3383
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:27,118
like that yeah um no i think america is

3384
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,480
coming to the point where we're going to

3385
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:31,359
compete with russia every single year in

3386
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:35,279
wrestling which obviously you know

3387
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:37,599
i a long long time ago many many we did

3388
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:40,000
we were great and then kind of after

3389
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:41,840
that soviet union period i think there

3390
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,359
was a lot of poverty in that area and

3391
01:47:41,840 --> 01:47:44,960
that kind of led the wrestling team

3392
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:47,519
going down a little bit and then

3393
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:48,639
obviously a lot of those regions

3394
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:50,880
where they found

3395
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:52,000
oil and gas in the caspian sea i believe

3396
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,000
and they've been

3397
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,719
um really kind of on the upswing for the

3398
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,800
last 20 years and now uh america really

3399
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:01,760
since 2012 has been on the upswing in

3400
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:03,039
wrestling and we're kind of really

3401
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,400
competing with them and they're not

3402
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:06,800
sending a couple of their best guys at

3403
01:48:04,399 --> 01:48:08,799
top so so for those who don't know the

3404
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:11,119
olympics i put back in the year so they

3405
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:12,239
are hosting the 2021 world championships

3406
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:13,519
despite the fact that we just had the

3407
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:15,678
olympics two months ago so it's

3408
01:48:13,520 --> 01:48:17,280
happening next week in oslo norway so

3409
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:21,359
like russia is not sending their number

3410
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:23,359
one at 57 and number 165 so it's like

3411
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:24,960
america's probably gonna win i think i

3412
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:26,238
don't want to guarantee anything but

3413
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:29,760
there's there's a really good chance

3414
01:48:26,238 --> 01:48:31,599
jake taylor also competing america gave

3415
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:33,119
any of the olympians that meddled the

3416
01:48:31,600 --> 01:48:34,480
opportunity to not even have to wrestle

3417
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:36,559
off they just got to keep the spot since

3418
01:48:34,479 --> 01:48:38,718
it was two months later if they meddled

3419
01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:40,560
so the only one who's not as gable

3420
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:42,319
gable's moving on we have a pretty good

3421
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:44,560
guy behind him named nick was dallas he

3422
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:47,039
was a world medalist uh but then he said

3423
01:48:44,560 --> 01:48:49,360
burroughs filled in the 79 spot

3424
01:48:47,039 --> 01:48:51,840
jayden cox filled in the 92 spot who's a

3425
01:48:49,359 --> 01:48:53,439
world champion also so we have uh uh

3426
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:54,159
it's a hell of a team pretty good squad

3427
01:48:53,439 --> 01:48:55,439
yeah

3428
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:56,319
pretty good squad

3429
01:48:55,439 --> 01:48:58,238
okay

3430
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:00,000
so given your run in bellator in one

3431
01:48:58,238 --> 01:49:02,959
championship that was like one of the

3432
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:05,359
most dominant runs in mma

3433
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:07,600
what would you say was like key to your

3434
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:08,799
dominance and that long undefeated

3435
01:49:07,600 --> 01:49:09,600
streak

3436
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:11,679
huh

3437
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:14,560
i i'd probably con consistency would be

3438
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:16,480
one the fact that

3439
01:49:14,560 --> 01:49:18,080
i just i lived and trained the same way

3440
01:49:16,479 --> 01:49:19,759
no matter where my life was whereas a

3441
01:49:18,079 --> 01:49:21,118
lot of fighters once they start making

3442
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,800
money for the first time they have all

3443
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:24,719
these obligations and they travel and

3444
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,960
they they really enjoy making money and

3445
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:29,198
that's kind of why some of them

3446
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,719
fall off she had like the same process

3447
01:49:29,198 --> 01:49:33,039
like the same yeah

3448
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:35,359
my house i didn't vacation ever yeah

3449
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:37,439
everything just no you know i

3450
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:39,519
and so that was a big part of it um

3451
01:49:37,439 --> 01:49:41,439
obviously the the style thing is like no

3452
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:43,440
one could there's only a few people who

3453
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:44,799
could stop my style

3454
01:49:43,439 --> 01:49:46,719
um

3455
01:49:44,800 --> 01:49:49,039
and i think i continued to get better as

3456
01:49:46,719 --> 01:49:50,880
a mixed martial artist and

3457
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:52,960
um

3458
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:55,118
i wasn't as innovative in mixed martial

3459
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,719
arts but there was a handful of things

3460
01:49:55,118 --> 01:49:59,039
that i innovated you know specifically

3461
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:01,520
in the top position where i spent a lot

3462
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:02,960
of time where just like there was just

3463
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:04,639
once that got on top of you it was like

3464
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:07,039
in a spider web and there was just kind

3465
01:50:04,639 --> 01:50:08,800
of no way out you know you never felt

3466
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:10,960
the certain things i was doing and so

3467
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:13,039
people just think hey they gave up

3468
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,719
eventually how's the level of wrestling

3469
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:16,479
in mma would you say

3470
01:50:14,719 --> 01:50:19,679
so

3471
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:21,598
uh i i saw somewhere like champions the

3472
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:24,480
the most popular martial art for current

3473
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:27,039
ufc champions they're all wrestling so

3474
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:29,359
we just lost a bunch of the bells

3475
01:50:27,039 --> 01:50:30,800
wrestling wrestling as a sport right but

3476
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:33,439
yeah one point we had i think it was

3477
01:50:30,800 --> 01:50:35,679
eight of nine maybe or something to that

3478
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:38,319
effect uh and i think i think it's not

3479
01:50:35,679 --> 01:50:39,840
just wrestling not just the actual

3480
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:42,639
martial art of wrestling that

3481
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,639
contributes to

3482
01:50:42,719 --> 01:50:45,760
our success in mixed martial arts but

3483
01:50:44,158 --> 01:50:47,198
other things like this the way we're

3484
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,639
systemized so

3485
01:50:47,198 --> 01:50:49,839
most kids who each have assists have

3486
01:50:48,639 --> 01:50:51,118
went through the high school program and

3487
01:50:49,840 --> 01:50:52,319
the college program and they know how to

3488
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:55,519
show up on time and they know how to

3489
01:50:52,319 --> 01:50:57,599
work hard so when they go to att or aka

3490
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:58,800
or wherever they know how to show up on

3491
01:50:57,599 --> 01:50:59,920
time and they know how to work hard and

3492
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,079
that's going to get you a really long

3493
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,760
way just those two things right not even

3494
01:51:02,079 --> 01:51:05,279
the techniques it's just the disciplines

3495
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:07,039
those things then i think you throw on

3496
01:51:05,279 --> 01:51:08,399
top of the fact that most of us have

3497
01:51:07,039 --> 01:51:10,560
competed

3498
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:12,638
1500 to 2000 times probably by the time

3499
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:13,920
we get to 20 something like that's a

3500
01:51:12,639 --> 01:51:15,760
huge advantage too most of these other

3501
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,319
people from other disciplines maybe have

3502
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:20,239
completed 100 if if that right so we

3503
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:22,479
have this competitive process down

3504
01:51:20,238 --> 01:51:24,638
really really really really well

3505
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:25,839
um plus the weight cut the weight cut

3506
01:51:24,639 --> 01:51:28,000
there's all these things right that

3507
01:51:25,840 --> 01:51:29,760
factor into it um i think the fact that

3508
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,800
we're really open-minded like i think if

3509
01:51:29,760 --> 01:51:33,119
you would

3510
01:51:30,800 --> 01:51:34,800
i don't pick on jiu-jitsu again but like

3511
01:51:33,118 --> 01:51:36,559
how many jiu jitsu guys have become

3512
01:51:34,800 --> 01:51:37,920
highly proficient in wrestling versus

3513
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:40,159
how many wrestling guys have become

3514
01:51:37,920 --> 01:51:42,639
highly proficient in jiu jitsu i think

3515
01:51:40,158 --> 01:51:44,479
that number swings one way and not that

3516
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:45,599
much the other way you know

3517
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:48,559
so

3518
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:51,520
we're open to adapting and learning and

3519
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:53,039
and for some reason like jiu jitsu

3520
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:55,199
people how many of them have got high

3521
01:51:53,039 --> 01:51:57,118
level wrestling or even mediocre

3522
01:51:55,198 --> 01:51:58,479
wrestling and the number's really small

3523
01:51:57,118 --> 01:51:59,598
like they refuse to it's really

3524
01:51:58,479 --> 01:52:01,359
frustrating

3525
01:51:59,599 --> 01:52:03,440
like why won't they do this is obviously

3526
01:52:01,359 --> 01:52:04,639
a part of it you know if like i don't

3527
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:06,158
pick on specific guys but there's

3528
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:07,520
certain guys in the history of mma where

3529
01:52:06,158 --> 01:52:09,679
you're like

3530
01:52:07,520 --> 01:52:11,280
listen man i mean damien maya who uh

3531
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:12,960
who's my last fight is a great example

3532
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:14,880
somebody actually did get proficient

3533
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:15,840
wrestling right

3534
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:17,599
but there's something that's jude you

3535
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:19,199
guys was like if you just got on top you

3536
01:52:17,599 --> 01:52:21,440
would submit him why can't you learn a

3537
01:52:19,198 --> 01:52:23,519
freaking takedown like holy moly like

3538
01:52:21,439 --> 01:52:25,039
just just learn how to take someone down

3539
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:25,840
once you get them down they will not get

3540
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:27,599
up

3541
01:52:25,840 --> 01:52:29,840
and you win the fight like it's so easy

3542
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:31,679
you know but they refuse how complicated

3543
01:52:29,840 --> 01:52:33,599
is that journey so like uh donahue that

3544
01:52:31,679 --> 01:52:34,639
you mentioned yeah craig jones they're

3545
01:52:33,599 --> 01:52:36,719
big on

3546
01:52:34,639 --> 01:52:38,880
wrestling as part of justin now yeah

3547
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:41,279
like wrestling not just on the feet but

3548
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:42,480
wrestling from the bottom coming up and

3549
01:52:41,279 --> 01:52:44,559
all that kind of

3550
01:52:42,479 --> 01:52:46,959
stuff so how difficult is that whole

3551
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:49,840
skill set would you say for jiu-jitsu

3552
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:50,880
person to learn um not that hard if they

3553
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:52,800
really put their mind to because they

3554
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:54,560
already like when you grapple and this

3555
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:56,719
is any grappling art like there's a

3556
01:52:54,560 --> 01:52:58,800
certain part of it that you kind of get

3557
01:52:56,719 --> 01:53:00,079
and it can it might not be the exact

3558
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,520
same thing but you understand how your

3559
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:03,359
body moves and how to feel certain

3560
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,760
pressures and you can adapt yourself

3561
01:53:03,359 --> 01:53:07,359
pretty quickly you know so i don't think

3562
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:09,440
that i think there's a certain level of

3563
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:10,880
stubbornness where they didn't want to

3564
01:53:09,439 --> 01:53:12,479
certain people didn't want to do it for

3565
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:13,920
whatever reason

3566
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:16,559
i think a lot of times

3567
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:17,920
in mma it's the i'm so macho i can stand

3568
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:20,719
and bang thing you know where they want

3569
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:22,800
to you know show how macho they are um

3570
01:53:20,719 --> 01:53:24,960
but yeah that was a frustrating one that

3571
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:27,199
they it there's a lot of wrestlers who

3572
01:53:24,960 --> 01:53:29,039
became highly proficient in jiu jitsu

3573
01:53:27,198 --> 01:53:30,238
and really adapted and it doesn't go the

3574
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:33,118
other way and then i guess the other

3575
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:34,638
thing there too is um

3576
01:53:33,118 --> 01:53:35,839
they can both steal from each other

3577
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:38,639
right as

3578
01:53:35,840 --> 01:53:40,719
any martial art can steal from another

3579
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:42,480
and like i feel like jujitsu didn't do

3580
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:43,599
enough stealing from wrestling like they

3581
01:53:42,479 --> 01:53:44,799
should have looked at all the wrestling

3582
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:46,639
possible and said

3583
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:48,079
well why why don't we steal that and

3584
01:53:46,639 --> 01:53:49,520
that and that you know and like hey

3585
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:52,158
let's take that over and maybe we'd make

3586
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:53,360
a little tweak because it's different

3587
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:56,638
but there's something we can definitely

3588
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:57,759
use there so like in wrestling

3589
01:53:56,639 --> 01:53:59,520
for example you know there's a one-armed

3590
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:01,199
guillotine in jujitsu right

3591
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:02,320
okay so there's a move called well it's

3592
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:03,359
got a hurricane it's like the oldest

3593
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:04,559
move in wrestling because it's what they

3594
01:54:03,359 --> 01:54:06,158
did the cows where they go around the

3595
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:07,920
chin and they throw them on their back i

3596
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:08,799
don't really call that one i don't know

3597
01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:10,639
okay

3598
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:13,199
sorry did you just ask me what i call

3599
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:15,520
that one yeah would you take a cow and

3600
01:54:13,198 --> 01:54:17,439
grab it by the no no

3601
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:18,239
no but in wrestling in wrestling i don't

3602
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:20,559
know

3603
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:22,000
okay are you putting it under yeah so

3604
01:54:20,560 --> 01:54:23,280
you grab their chin and then you go

3605
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:25,279
under their arm and then throw them

3606
01:54:23,279 --> 01:54:26,880
underneath okay gotcha yeah yeah so we

3607
01:54:25,279 --> 01:54:28,479
call that the honey badger but it's got

3608
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:31,440
honey badger different names wherever

3609
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:33,839
you go it's got different names um

3610
01:54:31,439 --> 01:54:36,079
so i would always i would say like

3611
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,840
pre-jiu-jitsu i was i was average at it

3612
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:40,238
like i could do it i but against good

3613
01:54:37,840 --> 01:54:41,440
people you'd never get it first because

3614
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:42,479
i'll tell you what exactly because they

3615
01:54:41,439 --> 01:54:43,519
would get the back of their head up and

3616
01:54:42,479 --> 01:54:44,879
they're too strong where you couldn't

3617
01:54:43,520 --> 01:54:46,480
collapse them by going over their neck

3618
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:48,079
right because the forces weren't right

3619
01:54:46,479 --> 01:54:49,598
so then in jiu jitsu you learn the one

3620
01:54:48,079 --> 01:54:51,279
arm guillotine where you grab their chin

3621
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:52,960
and this is more of running along the

3622
01:54:51,279 --> 01:54:55,599
side of their head and then and then you

3623
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:57,279
go here and you choke them right

3624
01:54:55,599 --> 01:54:59,360
much more efficient way to move their

3625
01:54:57,279 --> 01:55:02,238
head because the fulcrum is way down

3626
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:04,000
here and their head can move into that

3627
01:55:02,238 --> 01:55:06,079
right so once i learned that in jiu

3628
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,760
jitsu i'm like wait

3629
01:55:06,079 --> 01:55:09,279
i can do this in wrestling

3630
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:10,639
so now once i learn how to grab their

3631
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:12,880
chin the right way and i do the honey

3632
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:15,440
badger no one ever gets out i just had

3633
01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:17,279
to steal that jiu jitsu put in wrestling

3634
01:55:15,439 --> 01:55:19,039
and boom there we go but very few people

3635
01:55:17,279 --> 01:55:21,519
steal any direction that takes

3636
01:55:19,039 --> 01:55:22,560
creativity really and open minds so easy

3637
01:55:21,520 --> 01:55:24,880
because it's already done you just got

3638
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:26,960
to steal it i mean saying with judo if

3639
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:30,239
you're a geek you're just a person

3640
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:33,198
there's so much stuff in judo that um

3641
01:55:30,238 --> 01:55:36,319
that's ripe for the stealing because uh

3642
01:55:33,198 --> 01:55:38,319
judo is much more emphasizes uh

3643
01:55:36,319 --> 01:55:40,639
explosive

3644
01:55:38,319 --> 01:55:42,319
uh moves on the transition which is

3645
01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,159
something gestured does not do because

3646
01:55:42,319 --> 01:55:45,759
you have seen from the takedown to from

3647
01:55:44,158 --> 01:55:48,319
the takedown but also just in general

3648
01:55:45,760 --> 01:55:50,400
just in the transition the concept of

3649
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:52,639
transition the um

3650
01:55:50,399 --> 01:55:53,920
like it just is very much about like

3651
01:55:52,639 --> 01:55:55,118
we're in this position then we're in

3652
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:58,000
this position then we're in this

3653
01:55:55,118 --> 01:55:58,960
position yeah the the the judo is much

3654
01:55:58,000 --> 01:56:01,279
more

3655
01:55:58,960 --> 01:56:03,679
in when it when there's chaos of any

3656
01:56:01,279 --> 01:56:06,319
kind yeah that's when you need to strike

3657
01:56:03,679 --> 01:56:08,079
them and to learn that i mean that's why

3658
01:56:06,319 --> 01:56:10,399
people like travestines and judoka when

3659
01:56:08,079 --> 01:56:11,198
they go to jiu-jitsu they can dominate

3660
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:13,118
but

3661
01:56:11,198 --> 01:56:14,719
just the people should

3662
01:56:13,118 --> 01:56:16,158
steal that too stubborn

3663
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:17,359
yeah but so is every wrestlers are

3664
01:56:16,158 --> 01:56:18,879
stubborn too

3665
01:56:17,359 --> 01:56:20,000
no way

3666
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:22,800
there would never be any stubborn

3667
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:24,800
wrestlers well i mean i was surprised

3668
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:26,480
you know all these coaches john smith

3669
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:28,159
dan gable

3670
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:30,479
they don't really have interest in mma

3671
01:56:28,158 --> 01:56:32,399
or jiu jitsu and so on

3672
01:56:30,479 --> 01:56:34,559
like but you would think somebody like a

3673
01:56:32,399 --> 01:56:36,960
john smith would like

3674
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:39,039
put on a white belt and roll around yeah

3675
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:40,880
i think he's just too focused on you

3676
01:56:39,039 --> 01:56:42,719
know well he's a coach he's a coach and

3677
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:44,960
what he's doing yeah i mean yeah i think

3678
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:46,079
if you if you take him when he's younger

3679
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:47,359
he would have a lot of fun we actually

3680
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:49,760
have a really good wrestler making his

3681
01:56:47,359 --> 01:56:51,439
mma debut tomorrow and if you bow nickel

3682
01:56:49,760 --> 01:56:52,639
i'm sure you've heard of him very high

3683
01:56:51,439 --> 01:56:54,319
level i think he's going to have a lot

3684
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:56,400
of success

3685
01:56:54,319 --> 01:56:59,920
i mean some people might say that like

3686
01:56:56,399 --> 01:57:02,000
jiu jitsu makes you a little comfortable

3687
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:03,920
being in your back and for a wrestler

3688
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,319
that could be like really bad i hate

3689
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:09,599
that take yeah but that that's the dan

3690
01:57:06,319 --> 01:57:11,519
gable take it's so stupid it's so stupid

3691
01:57:09,599 --> 01:57:12,480
for god's sakes we know the [ __ ]

3692
01:57:11,520 --> 01:57:13,679
rules

3693
01:57:12,479 --> 01:57:16,079
russell you don't go to your back and

3694
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:18,880
jiu-jitsu you can it's like whatever

3695
01:57:16,079 --> 01:57:21,279
yeah nobody likes to jujutsu for example

3696
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:23,920
um so i coached when i was at rufus i

3697
01:57:21,279 --> 01:57:26,319
coached the wrestling for a long three

3698
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:27,840
four five years um so i've been taking a

3699
01:57:26,319 --> 01:57:29,679
jiu jitsu guy

3700
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:30,560
and teaching them a wrestling technique

3701
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:33,118
where

3702
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:35,280
you needed to use your feet

3703
01:57:33,118 --> 01:57:36,399
to teach youtube guys so easy so simple

3704
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:37,920
because they're they don't understand

3705
01:57:36,399 --> 01:57:39,759
the concept butterfly guard etcetera

3706
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:41,199
etcetera etcetera right to take a

3707
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:42,880
wrestler

3708
01:57:41,198 --> 01:57:44,479
who's never done any of it and teach him

3709
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,239
how to use his feet oh my god it's such

3710
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:47,598
a beast it's so hard you know because

3711
01:57:46,238 --> 01:57:50,638
they just that's not a weapon they're

3712
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:51,679
thinking about using so it's like

3713
01:57:50,639 --> 01:57:53,118
we understand the rules it's like

3714
01:57:51,679 --> 01:57:55,118
freestyle folks are wrestling freestyle

3715
01:57:53,118 --> 01:57:56,319
form on the map i can lock my hands you

3716
01:57:55,118 --> 01:57:57,359
don't see people lock on their hands all

3717
01:57:56,319 --> 01:57:59,198
the time in folk style just because they

3718
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:00,880
did freestyle it's like they they get it

3719
01:57:59,198 --> 01:58:02,319
there's a rule they understand it so the

3720
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:04,079
notion that

3721
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:06,960
somebody comes from on your back but

3722
01:58:04,079 --> 01:58:09,359
pinning that's like a

3723
01:58:06,960 --> 01:58:12,239
it has a special meaning yeah

3724
01:58:09,359 --> 01:58:14,479
but i actually think so jiu jitsu you uh

3725
01:58:12,238 --> 01:58:17,039
you don't actually want to be

3726
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:18,638
right flat flat very often right you

3727
01:58:17,039 --> 01:58:20,479
want to be i always wondered this

3728
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:23,199
because i did a couple of catch

3729
01:58:20,479 --> 01:58:24,959
wrestling tournaments and i did i would

3730
01:58:23,198 --> 01:58:26,079
put myself in butterfly

3731
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:26,800
guard

3732
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:28,399
and

3733
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:29,679
i wasn't going against good people so

3734
01:58:28,399 --> 01:58:32,559
which is why i was doing all these

3735
01:58:29,679 --> 01:58:35,840
things but i wondered if you could

3736
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:38,239
create a system of wrestling where your

3737
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:40,159
butterfly card so i think that there's

3738
01:58:38,238 --> 01:58:41,678
there's a few places where i use it but

3739
01:58:40,158 --> 01:58:43,679
so specifically the elevator series

3740
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:45,440
which my main suits off bottom it is

3741
01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:47,039
it's not a butterfly guard it's a

3742
01:58:45,439 --> 01:58:49,519
butterfly guard like grip with your foot

3743
01:58:47,039 --> 01:58:51,519
so i boom i go here i catch with my your

3744
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:53,920
leg with my foot boom and it elevates

3745
01:58:51,520 --> 01:58:56,080
you over right um and then also

3746
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:57,520
sometimes like uh

3747
01:58:56,079 --> 01:59:00,559
i think keegan does it too from watching

3748
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:02,400
me but if i get double leg sometimes uh

3749
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,440
if i'm accepting uh so freestyle

3750
01:59:02,399 --> 01:59:04,879
obviously you're gonna give a point

3751
01:59:03,439 --> 01:59:07,839
focus on accepting that you've already

3752
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:09,440
got me and as i go down i'm just gonna

3753
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:10,880
butterfly guard you off you know and

3754
01:59:09,439 --> 01:59:12,559
then i'm gonna try to flip my hip back

3755
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:13,520
to the mat and end up in a wizard

3756
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,199
position

3757
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:17,040
like i've used that quite a few times

3758
01:59:15,198 --> 01:59:19,118
where it's kind of like a bailout

3759
01:59:17,039 --> 01:59:21,039
mechanism that gets me back to

3760
01:59:19,118 --> 01:59:23,359
maybe not a great position but obviously

3761
01:59:21,039 --> 01:59:25,840
much better than being taken down

3762
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:27,759
beautiful yeah let me ask you quickly

3763
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:31,119
about crypto because you're also you

3764
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:33,760
have a you have a show you uh you have a

3765
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:36,238
lot of interest in cryptocurrency

3766
01:59:33,760 --> 01:59:38,079
why are you interested in cryptocurrency

3767
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:39,839
is it just a financial investment or is

3768
01:59:38,079 --> 01:59:42,559
there a philosophy that attracts you to

3769
01:59:39,840 --> 01:59:44,319
it philosophy so i

3770
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:46,239
my friend told me about in 2017 i was

3771
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:47,920
actually i went to i was i was uh my

3772
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:50,799
friend met me in shanghai i fought in

3773
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:52,560
one championship um and he told me and

3774
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:55,279
the second he told me i'm like

3775
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:56,400
i'm so in because i had read ron paul

3776
01:59:55,279 --> 01:59:58,158
and the fed

3777
01:59:56,399 --> 02:00:00,559
i read i you know kind of had

3778
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:01,598
understanding how the fed is

3779
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:03,840
unfair

3780
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:06,000
um and so we told him about crypto this

3781
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,279
decentralized system that no one has

3782
02:00:06,000 --> 02:00:09,039
control over

3783
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:10,158
it just made sense and so like we've had

3784
02:00:09,039 --> 02:00:11,760
you have the podcast we would say

3785
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:13,118
michael sailor on and i love the wasted

3786
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:14,960
it's like who do you trust more with

3787
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:16,639
your money you trust the politicians or

3788
02:00:14,960 --> 02:00:18,480
do you trust engineers

3789
02:00:16,639 --> 02:00:19,760
i think that's an easy choice i don't

3790
02:00:18,479 --> 02:00:20,799
even think i don't even think i have to

3791
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,560
think about that i don't trust

3792
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:24,880
politicians no matter what country they

3793
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:29,920
come from china america wherever i don't

3794
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:33,279
trust them so what about uh into in uh

3795
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:35,118
2017 what was bitcoin

3796
02:00:33,279 --> 02:00:36,639
are you um

3797
02:00:35,118 --> 02:00:38,158
what do you what do you find which ones

3798
02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:39,679
do you find interesting

3799
02:00:38,158 --> 02:00:41,759
yeah there's all kinds of ideas so

3800
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:42,560
there's the the the more

3801
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:45,599
sort of

3802
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:48,080
primal mechanism of proof-of-work and

3803
02:00:45,599 --> 02:00:49,279
bitcoin and then there's smart contracts

3804
02:00:48,079 --> 02:00:50,880
ideas and

3805
02:00:49,279 --> 02:00:53,118
uh there's all kinds of innovations

3806
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:54,800
across the different uh

3807
02:00:53,118 --> 02:00:56,479
so i can't say i'm yeah i'm in super

3808
02:00:54,800 --> 02:00:58,079
deep where i understand the technical

3809
02:00:56,479 --> 02:00:59,519
components of a lot of them i understand

3810
02:00:58,079 --> 02:01:01,039
what bitcoin can do for people and so

3811
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:02,239
that's probably the one i've i focused

3812
02:01:01,039 --> 02:01:04,399
the most on

3813
02:01:02,238 --> 02:01:05,759
um and i actually

3814
02:01:04,399 --> 02:01:07,198
i think i was talking about i was trying

3815
02:01:05,760 --> 02:01:08,880
to convince michael to talk about

3816
02:01:07,198 --> 02:01:11,198
bitcoin because he hates it also wait

3817
02:01:08,880 --> 02:01:13,760
dinner last night and i think most of

3818
02:01:11,198 --> 02:01:14,960
the main problems bitcoin solves

3819
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:16,320
people in america are so

3820
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:18,319
american-centric they don't understand

3821
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:19,840
it so like high levels of inflation that

3822
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:20,880
hasn't happened what's starting to

3823
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:22,079
happen it hasn't happened in america in

3824
02:01:20,880 --> 02:01:24,960
a long time right but someone in

3825
02:01:22,079 --> 02:01:27,760
venezuela is like oh i get that

3826
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:29,760
you know or remittance payments right

3827
02:01:27,760 --> 02:01:32,000
remittance payments to

3828
02:01:29,760 --> 02:01:34,159
you see it so i saw this in um when i

3829
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:36,399
was spending time in singapore singapore

3830
02:01:34,158 --> 02:01:38,399
is obviously a really wealthy country

3831
02:01:36,399 --> 02:01:39,920
and so you'd have indonesian workers or

3832
02:01:38,399 --> 02:01:42,000
philippines and they would all go on

3833
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,679
sundays they would go to these places to

3834
02:01:42,000 --> 02:01:45,359
ship stuff back to their families and

3835
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:46,800
through western union western union

3836
02:01:45,359 --> 02:01:49,439
couches the [ __ ] out of these people i

3837
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:51,599
mean they're taking 8 10 12 of whatever

3838
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:52,799
they're sending then it takes five days

3839
02:01:51,599 --> 02:01:55,520
and the person's gonna pick it up

3840
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:57,679
whereas bitcoin i could send you bitcoin

3841
02:01:55,520 --> 02:01:59,360
person to person right so like american

3842
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:00,319
people don't understand that american

3843
02:01:59,359 --> 02:02:02,158
people don't really understand the

3844
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:04,000
unbanked right a decent portion of the

3845
02:02:02,158 --> 02:02:06,319
world is unbanked they don't have access

3846
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,079
to it and a much much much smaller

3847
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:10,000
portion of the world doesn't have access

3848
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:12,719
to internet so if i can put a mobile

3849
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:14,079
wallet on your phone and we can send

3850
02:02:12,719 --> 02:02:15,039
money person to person so there's a

3851
02:02:14,079 --> 02:02:16,800
whole bunch of those problems where

3852
02:02:15,039 --> 02:02:19,198
americans don't really think about that

3853
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:21,279
are really obvious that this solves

3854
02:02:19,198 --> 02:02:23,279
um so i think that's the key one

3855
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:25,359
obviously the fact that i'm

3856
02:02:23,279 --> 02:02:27,840
the value goes up is really outstanding

3857
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:31,039
also but i but if you look at it

3858
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:33,039
yeah i got in in 2017 so i got to watch

3859
02:02:31,039 --> 02:02:35,118
it go up i didn't sell [ __ ] at the top

3860
02:02:33,039 --> 02:02:36,560
really stupid and then the majority of

3861
02:02:35,118 --> 02:02:38,559
my time was spent through the bear

3862
02:02:36,560 --> 02:02:40,320
market and so i had to love it for the

3863
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:42,080
principles that it provided not the fact

3864
02:02:40,319 --> 02:02:44,559
that actually i actually lost money in

3865
02:02:42,079 --> 02:02:47,359
the beginning and not now i'm way up but

3866
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:49,679
um yeah so you're just holding just

3867
02:02:47,359 --> 02:02:51,920
holding i think at the top of this bull

3868
02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:52,960
market i'll probably sell a very small

3869
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:54,639
portion

3870
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:56,079
um just so you mean like right now

3871
02:02:54,639 --> 02:02:57,920
there's a bull market

3872
02:02:56,079 --> 02:02:59,279
yeah most most people think say in the

3873
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,279
next three to six months will be at the

3874
02:02:59,279 --> 02:03:03,118
top of the market and so probably when

3875
02:03:01,279 --> 02:03:04,639
that happens uh i'll probably sell a

3876
02:03:03,118 --> 02:03:06,639
little bit

3877
02:03:04,639 --> 02:03:08,639
you gotta huddle it ben you got a hot

3878
02:03:06,639 --> 02:03:10,960
well yeah so i well i don't here's why i

3879
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:13,679
am so my pot one of my podcast co-hosts

3880
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:15,679
he's he's like super rich like uber rich

3881
02:03:13,679 --> 02:03:17,440
so he has lost touch with the every man

3882
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:19,840
yeah so here's my argument to him it's

3883
02:03:17,439 --> 02:03:21,598
really simple um and listen i'm doing

3884
02:03:19,840 --> 02:03:24,480
well for myself in life but

3885
02:03:21,599 --> 02:03:26,079
if say someone buys a bitcoin right one

3886
02:03:24,479 --> 02:03:29,439
bitcoin five thousand dollars which it

3887
02:03:26,079 --> 02:03:30,960
was last year and this bitcoin goes from

3888
02:03:29,439 --> 02:03:32,799
five thousand dollars to two hundred

3889
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:34,158
thousand dollars which is you know right

3890
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:35,920
around what a lot of people think the

3891
02:03:34,158 --> 02:03:38,719
peak is going to be they bought one

3892
02:03:35,920 --> 02:03:40,319
bitcoin and they're living in a 200 000

3893
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:41,359
house so

3894
02:03:40,319 --> 02:03:42,799
to take

3895
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:44,719
half of that right you started with five

3896
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:45,840
thousand dollars of bitcoin to sell half

3897
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:47,599
a bitcoin

3898
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:48,880
for a hundred thousand dollars and pay

3899
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:51,039
off your house your remaining house

3900
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:53,199
payment that's life-changing to someone

3901
02:03:51,039 --> 02:03:54,719
it really is and so you still have a

3902
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:56,399
bitcoin so if bitcoin goes to a million

3903
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:57,920
you're still gonna have half a million

3904
02:03:56,399 --> 02:03:59,118
and you're gonna feel really really rich

3905
02:03:57,920 --> 02:04:00,960
with it half a million dollars because

3906
02:03:59,118 --> 02:04:02,960
you bought it for for f and twenty five

3907
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:05,198
hundred dollars you know yeah so yeah so

3908
02:04:02,960 --> 02:04:08,158
i would encourage anyone who's not uber

3909
02:04:05,198 --> 02:04:09,519
rich to if you have huge profits take a

3910
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:11,679
little bit of them because it could

3911
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:14,560
change your life

3912
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:16,158
and if you hold it and it goes down

3913
02:04:14,560 --> 02:04:16,880
you're going to feel the pain of that

3914
02:04:16,158 --> 02:04:18,479
like

3915
02:04:16,880 --> 02:04:19,679
sometimes if you're more constrained

3916
02:04:18,479 --> 02:04:21,279
financially

3917
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:22,960
it's much more psychologically difficult

3918
02:04:21,279 --> 02:04:24,960
to ride the wood the ups and downs yeah

3919
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:26,719
it is for sure they have this really

3920
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:28,480
fascinating things in bitcoin actually i

3921
02:04:26,719 --> 02:04:30,560
said the guy on uh one of the main guys

3922
02:04:28,479 --> 02:04:33,359
on our podcast is it's called on chain

3923
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:35,360
metrics so all all wallet transactions

3924
02:04:33,359 --> 02:04:37,359
are visible you know and so they have

3925
02:04:35,359 --> 02:04:38,479
these all these fun categories i love so

3926
02:04:37,359 --> 02:04:41,359
i actually i think you said you don't

3927
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:43,198
like numbers but i like numbers

3928
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:44,880
i love numbers also so they have all

3929
02:04:43,198 --> 02:04:48,399
these different categories like um you

3930
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:50,319
can see how long a wallet has held a

3931
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:52,238
bitcoin right or how many bitcoins are

3932
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:54,158
in a certain wallet and so what they've

3933
02:04:52,238 --> 02:04:56,238
seen during this the downturn right so

3934
02:04:54,158 --> 02:04:58,879
april it kind of peaked and went down is

3935
02:04:56,238 --> 02:05:00,319
that the the whales are still boston

3936
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:01,760
whales people have a thousand or more

3937
02:05:00,319 --> 02:05:03,840
are still buying

3938
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:05,199
they've said the main group of sellers

3939
02:05:03,840 --> 02:05:07,279
is the ones who held it from zero to

3940
02:05:05,198 --> 02:05:08,238
three months so like they don't have

3941
02:05:07,279 --> 02:05:09,679
money they bought it because they

3942
02:05:08,238 --> 02:05:11,678
thought it was going up and i was like

3943
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:13,359
oh [ __ ] i gotta sell it right whereas

3944
02:05:11,679 --> 02:05:15,440
anyone's head out for a long time is

3945
02:05:13,359 --> 02:05:17,118
generally still holding on that's

3946
02:05:15,439 --> 02:05:20,000
interesting that's a good indicator

3947
02:05:17,118 --> 02:05:21,920
right for the whole space yeah well let

3948
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:24,560
me ask you for some advice you've been

3949
02:05:21,920 --> 02:05:26,880
through one heck of a career one heck of

3950
02:05:24,560 --> 02:05:28,400
a life what advice would you give to a

3951
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:30,480
young person today

3952
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:32,399
well in wrestling i

3953
02:05:30,479 --> 02:05:33,759
i think wrestling is really a microcosm

3954
02:05:32,399 --> 02:05:34,799
of what your life's going to be and

3955
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:36,320
that's why one of the things that i

3956
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:38,000
stress to kids is like

3957
02:05:36,319 --> 02:05:39,359
if we can go through this now and figure

3958
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:40,479
i i've couple kids you're struggling

3959
02:05:39,359 --> 02:05:42,559
certain things around if you can figure

3960
02:05:40,479 --> 02:05:44,158
out this now in wrestling

3961
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,320
to be a lot better figure out now and

3962
02:05:44,158 --> 02:05:48,879
get over this mental hump then when

3963
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:50,799
you're 32 and you have two kids and

3964
02:05:48,880 --> 02:05:51,760
right and your job's not going well it's

3965
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:53,360
gonna be a lot worse it's gonna be a lot

3966
02:05:51,760 --> 02:05:55,119
more painful then let's let's [ __ ]

3967
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:56,639
figure it out now so a lot of these

3968
02:05:55,118 --> 02:05:57,920
things a lot of these lessons we can

3969
02:05:56,639 --> 02:06:00,239
learn from wrestling whether it's

3970
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:01,679
persistence or perseverance or work

3971
02:06:00,238 --> 02:06:03,439
ethic or you know i said wrestles show

3972
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:04,639
up on time and they work hard right

3973
02:06:03,439 --> 02:06:06,479
these things if we can learn these

3974
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:08,159
things at an early age those are general

3975
02:06:06,479 --> 02:06:09,759
those characteristics characteristics

3976
02:06:08,158 --> 02:06:10,960
will generally carry on

3977
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:11,920
throughout our life and those are the

3978
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:13,920
things that are going to make us really

3979
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:15,679
successful so um

3980
02:06:13,920 --> 02:06:16,960
you know i would say find a great coach

3981
02:06:15,679 --> 02:06:18,239
someone who's gonna spend a lot of time

3982
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:20,000
and put a lot of time into you and make

3983
02:06:18,238 --> 02:06:21,598
sure they have a lot of wisdom and

3984
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:24,000
steal all the wisdom that you can from

3985
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:26,000
them and then though if you can be

3986
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,078
successful at one thing generally

3987
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:30,158
whatever that recipe was that took you

3988
02:06:28,078 --> 02:06:31,279
to be successful with that apply to

3989
02:06:30,158 --> 02:06:32,559
everything else

3990
02:06:31,279 --> 02:06:34,559
right apply to the rest of your life

3991
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:37,199
apply it to uh getting a wife that you

3992
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:38,719
enjoy uh apply it to

3993
02:06:37,198 --> 02:06:41,039
living in a place you want to live doing

3994
02:06:38,719 --> 02:06:42,560
a job you want to do right there's so

3995
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:44,319
many possibilities

3996
02:06:42,560 --> 02:06:45,840
and you just have to be bold enough to

3997
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:47,679
take those chances it's interesting

3998
02:06:45,840 --> 02:06:50,078
because like early on in life is when

3999
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:51,920
you have much more time like people

4000
02:06:50,078 --> 02:06:52,880
don't realize this time to learn the

4001
02:06:51,920 --> 02:06:55,520
lessons

4002
02:06:52,880 --> 02:06:57,520
like somehow later in life

4003
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:59,199
you get busier responsibilities and all

4004
02:06:57,520 --> 02:07:01,760
that kind of stuff like high school is a

4005
02:06:59,198 --> 02:07:04,479
magical time in college college yeah

4006
02:07:01,760 --> 02:07:06,239
yeah there's so much time

4007
02:07:04,479 --> 02:07:08,479
right learn well you don't even have

4008
02:07:06,238 --> 02:07:11,118
kids yet yeah i don't have kids

4009
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:12,799
still fills up well no i on purpose and

4010
02:07:11,118 --> 02:07:14,559
i did something that many people don't

4011
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:17,039
seem to be able to do i walked away from

4012
02:07:14,560 --> 02:07:20,400
a lot of responsibilities just

4013
02:07:17,039 --> 02:07:22,319
by saying goodbye oh okay but like but

4014
02:07:20,399 --> 02:07:24,319
you know meetings like everybody around

4015
02:07:22,319 --> 02:07:26,479
me at mit was like

4016
02:07:24,319 --> 02:07:29,198
meetings fill the day and then you have

4017
02:07:26,479 --> 02:07:30,959
more projects and you do a great job and

4018
02:07:29,198 --> 02:07:32,638
you become successful and then the more

4019
02:07:30,960 --> 02:07:35,359
meetings fill the day and more

4020
02:07:32,639 --> 02:07:36,960
responsibilities as opposed to like wait

4021
02:07:35,359 --> 02:07:38,399
a minute do i want to be involved in all

4022
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:39,520
these things

4023
02:07:38,399 --> 02:07:41,039
uh and

4024
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:43,360
instead do i want to

4025
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:45,039
find one or two things to really focus

4026
02:07:43,359 --> 02:07:47,598
on and

4027
02:07:45,039 --> 02:07:49,359
that's what i choose but like yeah that

4028
02:07:47,599 --> 02:07:51,760
becomes harder and harder and harder to

4029
02:07:49,359 --> 02:07:53,359
get older you know what i mean i'm sure

4030
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,440
and and also the more success you have

4031
02:07:53,359 --> 02:07:57,039
you become sought after other places

4032
02:07:55,439 --> 02:07:59,279
yeah too i'm sure that's happening with

4033
02:07:57,039 --> 02:08:00,719
you and it's hard to say keep saying no

4034
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:02,880
no no

4035
02:08:00,719 --> 02:08:06,560
it's hard yeah yeah

4036
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:09,199
you're known for roasting people

4037
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:10,800
with a single boom roasted line so uh

4038
02:08:09,198 --> 02:08:13,279
any ideas maybe you want to mention

4039
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:14,960
malice but any ideas come to uh mine

4040
02:08:13,279 --> 02:08:18,000
when you look at me

4041
02:08:14,960 --> 02:08:19,760
man i do you know what uh if i was gonna

4042
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:21,198
boom roast someone i would want to kind

4043
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:22,480
of like research their career and

4044
02:08:21,198 --> 02:08:24,638
dissect them and figure out their

4045
02:08:22,479 --> 02:08:25,919
biggest get to the core and i did i

4046
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:27,199
didn't have that notion with you i

4047
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:28,800
figured i

4048
02:08:27,198 --> 02:08:30,719
got a general sense of okay he's really

4049
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:31,679
successful he's super sharp uh he's

4050
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:33,198
really interested in some really

4051
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:34,800
interesting things i bet we'll have a

4052
02:08:33,198 --> 02:08:37,359
great conversation but i had no

4053
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:38,880
intention to roast you yeah there you go

4054
02:08:37,359 --> 02:08:42,078
what about mouse you had dinner with him

4055
02:08:38,880 --> 02:08:43,520
last night hmm for him

4056
02:08:42,078 --> 02:08:46,880
oh man

4057
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:48,159
um how'd you get to know him by the way

4058
02:08:46,880 --> 02:08:50,078
just twitter where's the most magical

4059
02:08:48,158 --> 02:08:51,198
place in the world right i always tell

4060
02:08:50,078 --> 02:08:53,439
you it's a great source of information

4061
02:08:51,198 --> 02:08:54,719
if you know how to use it um

4062
02:08:53,439 --> 02:08:57,118
hmm

4063
02:08:54,719 --> 02:08:58,639
he's insane on twitter actually he saw i

4064
02:08:57,118 --> 02:09:00,238
had to unfollow him on twitter because

4065
02:08:58,639 --> 02:09:02,400
he it was too intense too much just too

4066
02:09:00,238 --> 02:09:03,839
much too much it fills up like i want to

4067
02:09:02,399 --> 02:09:04,879
be able to consume the content so if i

4068
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:06,719
want to see something he says i can go

4069
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:08,719
to his page right

4070
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:10,719
but it's just too much for my timeline i

4071
02:09:08,719 --> 02:09:12,000
want to be able to consume who i follow

4072
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:12,960
so i try to not follow a lot of people

4073
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:16,399
because i want to be able to consume

4074
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:18,480
them um and he was he was too much he he

4075
02:09:16,399 --> 02:09:19,920
fights the trolls which uh

4076
02:09:18,479 --> 02:09:21,519
i don't know why we would ever fight the

4077
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:22,960
trolls there's just too many of them

4078
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:25,440
well he's the troll himself he's like

4079
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:27,760
the big troll fighting the little trolls

4080
02:09:25,439 --> 02:09:29,359
he's the king troll there's a million of

4081
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:30,400
them so even if you kill if you kill a

4082
02:09:29,359 --> 02:09:31,839
hundred thousand they're still not a

4083
02:09:30,399 --> 02:09:33,439
hundred thousand left did you just keep

4084
02:09:31,840 --> 02:09:36,400
calling he's gonna ignore him it's the

4085
02:09:33,439 --> 02:09:38,000
like the night walker or whatever yeah

4086
02:09:36,399 --> 02:09:40,078
well i'll take it because you had

4087
02:09:38,000 --> 02:09:42,399
nothing um you could you couldn't roast

4088
02:09:40,078 --> 02:09:43,840
gsp out of respect too yeah so i'm just

4089
02:09:42,399 --> 02:09:45,598
gonna take that as a sign what do you

4090
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:47,199
say bad about gsp

4091
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:48,800
now i try to roast his hair like why are

4092
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:50,799
you trying to grow grow hair now after

4093
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:52,400
all these years he looked good bald

4094
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:53,920
everyone loved him with his head shaved

4095
02:09:52,399 --> 02:09:55,679
yeah now it looks kind of strange like

4096
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:57,520
why you got hair now well it was uh one

4097
02:09:55,679 --> 02:10:00,399
of the more surreal moments of my life

4098
02:09:57,520 --> 02:10:02,239
is so he was here and he wore a black

4099
02:10:00,399 --> 02:10:03,839
suit and tie

4100
02:10:02,238 --> 02:10:06,238
oh really yeah we did the podcast with

4101
02:10:03,840 --> 02:10:07,760
him just mirror image of me

4102
02:10:06,238 --> 02:10:09,279
and then we also did uh i haven't

4103
02:10:07,760 --> 02:10:11,199
released it yet but just a video

4104
02:10:09,279 --> 02:10:13,039
together and i was doing a martial arts

4105
02:10:11,198 --> 02:10:16,479
stuff in a suit and tie

4106
02:10:13,039 --> 02:10:17,840
that was quite sick that was quite uh

4107
02:10:16,479 --> 02:10:19,439
that that's like

4108
02:10:17,840 --> 02:10:20,800
like certain moments in your life are

4109
02:10:19,439 --> 02:10:22,719
just like

4110
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:25,039
i can't believe i was part of that yeah

4111
02:10:22,719 --> 02:10:26,800
from uh with gsp uh so yeah i don't

4112
02:10:25,039 --> 02:10:29,439
think i have anything to roast him about

4113
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:30,800
um i mean maybe the matt sarah thing

4114
02:10:29,439 --> 02:10:32,960
would be the one that you could get him

4115
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:34,639
with you know but uh yeah i would be i

4116
02:10:32,960 --> 02:10:36,800
would be really fascinated like really

4117
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:38,560
dig deep uh from a sports psychology

4118
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:39,760
standpoint because he always talks about

4119
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:42,079
how much fear he had when he was

4120
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:44,400
competing and i and i find that to be

4121
02:10:42,078 --> 02:10:46,158
interesting because obviously so it's

4122
02:10:44,399 --> 02:10:47,759
almost like to me it's almost like

4123
02:10:46,158 --> 02:10:50,559
was he successful

4124
02:10:47,760 --> 02:10:53,119
despite that not because of that right

4125
02:10:50,560 --> 02:10:54,400
and because anxiety usually leads it

4126
02:10:53,118 --> 02:10:56,799
really negative performance for the

4127
02:10:54,399 --> 02:10:59,198
majority of people and what was it about

4128
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:00,960
him that the anxiety wasn't super

4129
02:10:59,198 --> 02:11:02,799
negative you know what i'm saying like

4130
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:04,158
it's it's very interesting i wonder that

4131
02:11:02,800 --> 02:11:06,000
too so i have

4132
02:11:04,158 --> 02:11:07,839
i wanted that about him but i have a

4133
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:09,439
huge amount of anxiety interacting

4134
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:11,440
especially with people just about

4135
02:11:09,439 --> 02:11:14,158
everything yeah i wonder if that's

4136
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:16,638
helpful or or not it feels like it's

4137
02:11:14,158 --> 02:11:18,879
very helpful well i think so it's okay i

4138
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:20,960
think in two different so i think uh

4139
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:23,520
probably your everyday life okay is

4140
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:25,920
different than like in a performance or

4141
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:28,639
a competition it's you have to be like

4142
02:11:25,920 --> 02:11:30,800
super in the moment of what you're doing

4143
02:11:28,639 --> 02:11:32,078
so anything that's pulling you away like

4144
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:33,920
oh my gosh

4145
02:11:32,078 --> 02:11:36,000
high school kids right that coach oh my

4146
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:38,158
gosh my that girl's in the stands and if

4147
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:39,760
i get beat then and they're actually

4148
02:11:38,158 --> 02:11:42,158
they're actively thinking about this

4149
02:11:39,760 --> 02:11:43,840
other thing when this is going on and i

4150
02:11:42,158 --> 02:11:45,519
need a hundred percent of your focus

4151
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:47,760
well here he's never i don't think he

4152
02:11:45,520 --> 02:11:49,040
has anxiety in the ring that's the point

4153
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:50,960
i think like

4154
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:53,760
i have the same thing like if i have a

4155
02:11:50,960 --> 02:11:55,920
really high performance thing

4156
02:11:53,760 --> 02:11:57,360
that i have to do uh i don't know let

4157
02:11:55,920 --> 02:11:58,880
you in front of a lot of people yeah

4158
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:01,039
that would be a great example

4159
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:03,840
that there's huge amount of anxiety

4160
02:12:01,039 --> 02:12:07,039
weeks ahead days ahead hours ahead so

4161
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:09,279
you have a system to get rid of it then

4162
02:12:07,039 --> 02:12:11,439
maybe but it's just the body gets rid of

4163
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:13,840
it somehow yeah there's not a system

4164
02:12:11,439 --> 02:12:15,678
subconscious system yeah it's so you

4165
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:18,239
don't you don't actually have anxiety

4166
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:20,480
while you're performing so that's like

4167
02:12:18,238 --> 02:12:21,919
so then that problem somehow that

4168
02:12:20,479 --> 02:12:23,439
problem has solved itself right the

4169
02:12:21,920 --> 02:12:25,359
problem is when the anxiety is actually

4170
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:28,000
happening while the wrestling match is

4171
02:12:25,359 --> 02:12:30,399
happening that's the real issue yeah but

4172
02:12:28,000 --> 02:12:32,078
it's it like sneaks in there too is

4173
02:12:30,399 --> 02:12:35,598
that's the difference between mma in

4174
02:12:32,078 --> 02:12:37,840
wrestling is there's no breaks in

4175
02:12:35,599 --> 02:12:39,840
wrestling right yeah i guess there is

4176
02:12:37,840 --> 02:12:42,560
you can look at the crowd a little bit

4177
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:45,039
like you can look so maybe maybe but

4178
02:12:42,560 --> 02:12:46,400
like the there's other things we have to

4179
02:12:45,039 --> 02:12:48,238
perform

4180
02:12:46,399 --> 02:12:49,679
well there's more breaks like a lecture

4181
02:12:48,238 --> 02:12:51,759
you can catch yourself thinking like in

4182
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:53,359
this conversation you know yeah like

4183
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:54,159
i'll i've said a bunch of stuff where i

4184
02:12:53,359 --> 02:12:55,839
think

4185
02:12:54,158 --> 02:12:58,158
why the hell would you say that that's

4186
02:12:55,840 --> 02:13:00,078
dumb right that that's the anxiety

4187
02:12:58,158 --> 02:13:02,319
because there's a pause

4188
02:13:00,078 --> 02:13:04,319
and that that that could be um i don't

4189
02:13:02,319 --> 02:13:06,399
know i i think it just pushes me to be

4190
02:13:04,319 --> 02:13:08,719
better but maybe i could be way better

4191
02:13:06,399 --> 02:13:10,799
if i'll go that yeah it's scary to think

4192
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:12,399
that jsp if you let go that way

4193
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:14,560
because he didn't even better yeah or

4194
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:15,598
did he ever did did he have like you're

4195
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:17,679
saying like

4196
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:19,039
you don't necessarily feel those so i

4197
02:13:17,679 --> 02:13:21,039
think certain people that i've coached

4198
02:13:19,039 --> 02:13:23,198
like they would describe how they would

4199
02:13:21,039 --> 02:13:24,639
feel literally during the wrestling

4200
02:13:23,198 --> 02:13:25,678
match right and you're saying like

4201
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:28,480
during the

4202
02:13:25,679 --> 02:13:29,920
speech performance it's mostly gone yep

4203
02:13:28,479 --> 02:13:31,279
and that's that's it'll be interesting

4204
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:32,639
to see if like

4205
02:13:31,279 --> 02:13:34,158
you know he talked a lot about that but

4206
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:35,920
if it was all if it was all the way

4207
02:13:34,158 --> 02:13:37,279
somehow gone and he it means he would

4208
02:13:35,920 --> 02:13:38,719
have a mechanism for it so i had a

4209
02:13:37,279 --> 02:13:40,880
really bad performance my freshman year

4210
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:42,719
of high school at nationals

4211
02:13:40,880 --> 02:13:44,560
because i had i had the ability to be

4212
02:13:42,719 --> 02:13:46,880
anxious and what my coaches talked about

4213
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:48,639
like and a lot of a type personalities

4214
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:49,760
are kind of that way you know because

4215
02:13:48,639 --> 02:13:52,560
they're trying to consider all

4216
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:54,239
possibilities at the same time and

4217
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:56,480
and while we're actually performing or

4218
02:13:54,238 --> 02:13:58,479
competing it's negative to performance

4219
02:13:56,479 --> 02:14:00,399
right um so he said

4220
02:13:58,479 --> 02:14:02,718
he would always leading up to the match

4221
02:14:00,399 --> 02:14:03,598
within say an hour he would his name was

4222
02:14:02,719 --> 02:14:04,480
talking about fishing he would get

4223
02:14:03,599 --> 02:14:05,520
someone to talk about fishing with him

4224
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:07,039
because they would stop him thinking

4225
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:09,280
about the match and and being uber

4226
02:14:07,039 --> 02:14:10,560
anxious so i i kind of really took that

4227
02:14:09,279 --> 02:14:12,399
hard and it really helped me as i would

4228
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:14,719
always like have someone to talk to and

4229
02:14:12,399 --> 02:14:16,399
just just goof around about whatever so

4230
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:18,399
i'm not thinking about this thing and

4231
02:14:16,399 --> 02:14:20,638
then once i step in it's time to go so i

4232
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:22,238
didn't have this like anxious buildup

4233
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:23,599
and that was how for me i took it away

4234
02:14:22,238 --> 02:14:24,559
but like me you know like you said you

4235
02:14:23,599 --> 02:14:26,000
have

4236
02:14:24,560 --> 02:14:27,360
a way to get it away obviously because

4237
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:29,039
yeah i guess so i guess there's little

4238
02:14:27,359 --> 02:14:30,319
little tricks you come up with yeah you

4239
02:14:29,039 --> 02:14:32,319
start thinking about it's not fishing

4240
02:14:30,319 --> 02:14:34,078
maybe i should try the fishing thing but

4241
02:14:32,319 --> 02:14:35,679
i hate fishing so boring

4242
02:14:34,078 --> 02:14:36,960
well maybe maybe it's good to think

4243
02:14:35,679 --> 02:14:39,359
about that

4244
02:14:36,960 --> 02:14:41,039
