00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,320
nick carter who is a partner

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:08,558
at castle island ventures co-founder of

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,880
coinmetrics.io

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:13,279
and previously a crypto asset research

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,080
analyst at fidelity investments

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,198
he's a prominent writer speaker and

8
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,599
podcaster

9
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,720
on topics around decentralized finance

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,080
and especially

11
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:27,038
bitcoin quick mention of our sponsors

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,000
the information athletic greens for

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:29,920
sigmatic

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,719
and blinkist check them out in the

15
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,559
description to support this podcast

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,079
this conversation with nick carter is

17
00:00:34,558 --> 00:00:37,280
part of a series of episodes on

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,200
cryptocurrency

19
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,280
that is a small journey of exploration

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,000
i'm on because i find decentralized

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,719
finance

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,640
and especially bitcoin fascinating

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,800
technically and philosophically

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,399
especially because it may be the very

25
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,878
mechanism that achieves

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,480
a global decentralization of power

27
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:55,359
giving more sovereignty to the

28
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:57,919
individual

29
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,799
and making our systems more resilient to

30
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,280
corruption

31
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:02,078
manipulation and in general to the

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,478
darker side

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,519
of human nature please let me also

34
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,239
address something

35
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,400
for a few minutes that happened recently

36
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,239
that's been weighing heavy on me

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,920
if you find me annoying to listen to

38
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,039
please skip to the actual conversation

39
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,280
with nick

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,960
i had a recent podcast episode with

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,079
anthony pompliano

42
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:24,959
where we spoke about bitcoin and life

43
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,079
in general for three hours i was curious

44
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,719
inspired

45
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:30,078
positive or at least i tried to be as i

46
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,959
usually do

47
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:35,039
someone clipped out out of context a

48
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,839
short segment of me mumbling something

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
about having a phd and i started getting

50
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,880
mocked

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,680
online because that made it convenient

52
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:43,679
for people

53
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,720
to mock me for being yet another

54
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,200
quote-unquote

55
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:49,118
expert who learns about bitcoin and

56
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,118
thinks he knows everything

57
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,759
i almost never mentioned that i have a

58
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:56,159
phd except to make fun of myself

59
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,280
as i was doing or at least trying to do

60
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,359
in the full context of that conversation

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,439
i brought up grad school as a random

62
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:04,239
example of one of the many journeys i've

63
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:06,478
taken

64
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,159
that was hard but where the destination

65
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,719
was in itself

66
00:02:08,159 --> 00:02:12,560
not very useful i was saying i enjoy

67
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:14,959
exploring with a curious mind

68
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,000
and i'm willing to be patient to learn

69
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,319
to listen

70
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,239
to humble myself with knowledge for the

71
00:02:18,318 --> 00:02:22,719
sake of knowledge itself

72
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,640
grad school was an example of that the

73
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,280
phd means nothing

74
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,919
at least to me i never call myself an

75
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
expert

76
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,119
or at least try not to because that

77
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,560
would be dumb

78
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,120
because i know how little i know i'm not

79
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,000
a

80
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,959
influencer or a thought leader or

81
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,519
whatever else

82
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,959
silly self-aggrandizing label people put

83
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,280
on their linkedin

84
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,479
i try to be the opposite of what i was

85
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,719
mocked for

86
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,238
i try to think deeply about the world to

87
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,280
look for the beautiful ideas in the

88
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
minds of others

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,280
and to be inspired by them i wanted to

90
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,599
say all this because

91
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,719
psychologically it struck a bit of a

92
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,719
blow

93
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,400
it made me realize that even when i

94
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:05,439
approach things with love

95
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,519
i may be mocked i may be derided i may

96
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,919
be taken out of context or even

97
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,920
lied about with the growing platform

98
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,318
this is sadly only increasing

99
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:16,479
i now have learned that there's people

100
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:19,199
who are waiting for my missteps

101
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:19,518
so they can point the finger laugh and

102
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,719
say

103
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,239
see i told you so that guy's a joke he's

104
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,400
a fraud

105
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,239
as a fellow human being the knowledge of

106
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,200
this is painful

107
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,519
yes i know people tell me to toughen up

108
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,919
and

109
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,840
my life has been about strengthening my

110
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,399
mind in the face of my limits

111
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,840
but i refuse to not be fragile and wear

112
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,959
my heart on my sleeve

113
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,799
it's who i am in some sense this is the

114
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,519
immune system of the internet

115
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,519
but let us be careful not to destroy the

116
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,759
good ones in the process

117
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,680
the bitcoin community had to endure many

118
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,479
years of attacks from quote unquote

119
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,319
experts

120
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,318
and also fraudulent cryptocurrency

121
00:03:56,318 --> 00:03:59,199
efforts that scam people out of their

122
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:01,839
money

123
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,359
this created a powerful immune system

124
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
that fought the attackers and the

125
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,040
scammers

126
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,878
i understand this and i also understand

127
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,598
that one of the beautiful aspects

128
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:13,120
of bitcoin is its community of humans is

129
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,119
decentralized

130
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,319
but some small part of this community

131
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
has come to enjoy the

132
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,519
us versus them battles sometimes for the

133
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,639
sake

134
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,560
of the battle in itself this happens in

135
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,079
political discourse as well

136
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,160
i understand this but to my limited mind

137
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,159
it sounds like group think which has

138
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,120
powerful defense mechanisms against bad

139
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,000
ideas

140
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
but has dangerous consequences if taken

141
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,439
too far

142
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,960
as in many periods of human history that

143
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,519
i often talk about

144
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:46,159
where the us versus them thinking has

145
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,240
led to the suffering of many

146
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,080
again i understand the value of this as

147
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,639
many bitcoin is explained to me

148
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,519
but it's not the way i as a sovereign

149
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,400
individual

150
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,000
choose to walk in this life by the way

151
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,599
none of this podcast should be treated

152
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,079
as financial advice

153
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,759
before nick kindly gifted me with a

154
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,439
hundred dollars worth of bitcoin

155
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,759
in hardware form i didn't own any

156
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,279
i'll probably buy some bitcoin on cash

157
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,360
app coinbase and

158
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:14,478
other platforms and also transfer to a

159
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,639
hardware wallet

160
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,038
just to learn how to do it but other

161
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:20,400
than that i don't necessarily make wise

162
00:05:19,038 --> 00:05:22,079
investment decisions

163
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,638
money is not a motivation for me

164
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:26,800
personally i try to avoid it actually

165
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,478
i'm grateful for every day i'm alive no

166
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,199
matter how much money is in my bank

167
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,879
account

168
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,038
for long stretches of my life that

169
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:35,439
number was very close to zero

170
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,639
and i was always fortunate to be free

171
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:38,879
and happy

172
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,160
so i encourage you to listen to people

173
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:43,439
much smarter than me

174
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,560
for actual good financial advice here

175
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:48,719
i'm just exploring ideas and as if this

176
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,478
has not already gone on too long

177
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
let me please make another comment on

178
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:55,199
the style of discourse among

179
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,319
some bitcoin maximalists on platforms

180
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,280
like twitter

181
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,400
that in my humble view i may be wrong

182
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:02,478
but i believe

183
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,399
is not conducive to the nuanced

184
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:07,519
empathetic exchange of ideas

185
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:09,279
i very much look for and enjoy again i

186
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:11,439
appreciate their style of discourse

187
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:12,478
i think i understand the value of it but

188
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,800
it's not my thing

189
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,879
so i don't want to engage in it i want

190
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,120
to hear the quiet voices in the room

191
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,399
i look for people to inspire each other

192
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,399
and when we disagree

193
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:23,439
i look for disagreement that is grounded

194
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,079
in respect

195
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,038
and empathy i think that mockery and

196
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:28,560
derision

197
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,318
destroys the possibility of those

198
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,399
nuanced conversations

199
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,879
it drives away the quiet thoughtful

200
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:36,959
empathetic voices and i try to give

201
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,839
those voices space to be heard

202
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,478
to shine to exchange ideas whether we

203
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,079
agree

204
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:45,120
or disagree so if i happen to block you

205
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,318
on twitter

206
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,639
i block you with love honestly

207
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,000
i will never speak poorly view or even

208
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,000
think poorly of you

209
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,360
i would love to hang out in person give

210
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,079
you a big old hug

211
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,800
and talk about life over some beers if

212
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:03,439
you see or hear me say something stupid

213
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,560
which i'm sure i do often or something

214
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,160
you disagree with

215
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,399
and you still respect me as a human

216
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,280
being please show your love as i always

217
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:11,839
do to you

218
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,318
but also send me some links to blogs

219
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:15,279
books

220
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,000
videos podcasts where people describe

221
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:18,799
why

222
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,038
my stated idea may be totally wrong i

223
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,038
love this kind of long-form disagreement

224
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:25,038
i humble myself every day by reading

225
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,279
books and blogs by people

226
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:28,800
much smarter than me sometimes it

227
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,359
strengthens my ideas

228
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,800
sometimes it totally changes them but i

229
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,759
always learn

230
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,560
this is a two long way of saying that

231
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,720
i'm here

232
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,839
trying to walk with grace and with an

233
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,199
open mind

234
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:45,758
a bit of patience and always love

235
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
if i make mistakes cut me some slack

236
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,319
like you

237
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:53,680
i'm only human allegedly

238
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:57,360
this is the lex friedman podcast and

239
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,240
here is my conversation with nick carter

240
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,319
what philosopher or philosophical idea

241
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,918
had a big impact on your life

242
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,919
not just in the space of cryptocurrency

243
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,598
but in general oh so we're

244
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,120
we're going now we're rolling going

245
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:09,918
right in rolling because you majored

246
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,240
philosophy

247
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,198
i did i majored in philosophy i didn't

248
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,199
know what to do

249
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,800
with my life and my parents said do

250
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,400
whatever you find interesting it's like

251
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,960
okay philosophy great

252
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:22,719
i find that interesting yeah um and it

253
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:23,439
had way more of an impact on my career

254
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,800
actually

255
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:28,240
uh than i thought it might you know

256
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,840
typically i guess if you do philosophy

257
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,918
you go into a lot of finance so it sort

258
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,399
of makes sense but

259
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,000
um there are a number of philosophers i

260
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,000
really admire

261
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,918
uh the big one of my favorites would be

262
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,599
descartes probably the notion of

263
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,038
skepticism

264
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,519
it's sort of a rabbit hole it's kind of

265
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:47,039
hard to pull yourself out of it

266
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,879
basically the brain in the vat theory

267
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,759
pulling yourself out of that

268
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,200
but yeah i really like epistemology you

269
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,720
know questioning what it is to have

270
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
knowledge

271
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,879
um so descartes was was one of my

272
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,039
gateways to that

273
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,799
do you think everything is noble like we

274
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:06,000
humans can

275
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,120
can know fully the objective reality oh

276
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,919
definitely not

277
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,360
no i mean i reality is very much

278
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,639
processed through your own

279
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,039
you know subjective lens so

280
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,559
how much do you think do we understand

281
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,399
about this world

282
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,639
because a lot of your ideas a lot of

283
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,240
things we might talk about today

284
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,679
are kind of trying to figure out human

285
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,959
civilization how

286
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:31,278
humans how human behavior works at scale

287
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,879
all those kinds of things that kind of

288
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:35,919
assumes that we have it

289
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,559
or we're able to somehow figure most of

290
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,519
it out

291
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:40,958
right so in your sort of when you step

292
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,560
way back

293
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,039
how much of it have we really figured

294
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,399
out well i think that's the conceit of

295
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,000
economics is

296
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,320
thinking that you can model human

297
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,399
behavior right in these unbelievably

298
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,839
complex systems

299
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,759
and then i think that's the modern

300
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,519
critique of economics like the sort of

301
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,919
tilapian critique

302
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,879
is that you can't have true knowledge

303
00:09:59,919 --> 00:10:03,360
and they're much

304
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,439
less predictable than we think they are

305
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,680
and you know we behave

306
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,200
according to our accumulated assumptions

307
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,039
and we're using tiny sort of

308
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,480
data sets trained on the last fifty

309
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:15,199
hundred years

310
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,959
and they turn out to be horribly askew

311
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,720
and that's when we have our grace wands

312
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:22,639
and our black swans

313
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,320
uh so i'm i'm much more on the sort of

314
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,720
you know reality is much less notable

315
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,320
than we think side of things

316
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,079
but it is nice to have very concrete

317
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,800
things like bitcoin that's for sure

318
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,319
oh so you think so most of it is shaky

319
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,879
ground but there are some things there's

320
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,800
like islands of sturdiness

321
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,799
yeah bitcoin is one of them that's

322
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,319
that's a good way to put it yeah i mean

323
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:44,078
like look at the dollar system not to

324
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,440
pivot this into the dollar right away

325
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,479
but

326
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,560
the dollar is like shaky ground

327
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,639
who truly understands the dollar system

328
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:54,399
i mean the totality of it the euro

329
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,639
dollar system

330
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,320
the way that monetary policy interacts

331
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,360
with the economy

332
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,560
is monetary issuance inflationary

333
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,560
what's the relationship between

334
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,399
unemployment and inflation

335
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,919
even policymakers don't understand these

336
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,278
things economists don't seem to

337
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,799
understand them

338
00:11:09,278 --> 00:11:12,078
what is deflation how do you define

339
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:13,039
inflation none of these things are

340
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,000
really known

341
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,199
or knowable so a lot of people kind of

342
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,039
make a claim that there's a lot of

343
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,680
manipulation possible with the dollar

344
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,399
with the

345
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,958
with those currencies if you couple that

346
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,440
with

347
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,399
the fact that people don't understand it

348
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,360
and yet

349
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,799
there's claims that being manipulated by

350
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,039
centralized power

351
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,120
how do you bring those two ideas

352
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,480
together if no one understands it how

353
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,919
can you manipulate it

354
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,680
i think what we don't understand are the

355
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:43,278
long-term consequences

356
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:43,919
of our structures so like the fed's

357
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,679
mandate

358
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:50,159
to target unemployment and steady

359
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,519
um you know exchange rates or low

360
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,759
inflation

361
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,278
you know what we don't understand is

362
00:11:53,759 --> 00:11:57,360
okay what is the result of doing that

363
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:59,919
continuously for 40 years

364
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,919
right what is the net effect of that

365
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,679
what is the consequence of the long-term

366
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,159
accumulation of debt

367
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,439
and you know basement interest rates

368
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,120
what is the net effect of that on

369
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,120
society

370
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,320
we might understand just much short

371
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,000
short term

372
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,000
features of the system but i think it's

373
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,879
the longer term features we don't

374
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,958
understand

375
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:20,000
do you think there's like malevolent

376
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,638
people

377
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
like people that don't have good intent

378
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,440
in central banks like

379
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,839
in the system you know uh

380
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,240
when you have centralized power any

381
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:35,040
forms

382
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,839
it's susceptible to somebody hacking the

383
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,719
system

384
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,480
taking the power and in the shadows this

385
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,519
is where conspiracy theories come in

386
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,959
right in the shadows be able to

387
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,839
uh you know act

388
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:51,199
out things that have a lot of negative

389
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,160
impacts on the large percent of the

390
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,720
population

391
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,159
in self in greedy self-interest do you

392
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,480
think there's people like that or do you

393
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,278
think

394
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,839
fundamentally most people are good even

395
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,639
those

396
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,760
associated with the sort of central

397
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,519
banking

398
00:13:03,759 --> 00:13:07,600
oh i mean i don't villainize those

399
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,639
people i think everyone is the hero of

400
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,200
their own story

401
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:13,759
right so they all believe that they're

402
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,360
forced for good in the world you have to

403
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,958
are there any true villains i don't

404
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,120
think so i think

405
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,319
they get socialized into a world where

406
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,120
they believe

407
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,760
their particular skills and their

408
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,278
mandate

409
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:30,000
is you know what they should be doing um

410
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:33,439
i think they might be presumptuous or

411
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,440
arrogant in some cases

412
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,359
and you know i think it's more of a

413
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,959
systemic issue where you have

414
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,480
a small handful of very homogenous

415
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,919
types of people with phds from the same

416
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,680
institutions that are brought up in the

417
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,719
same cultural context

418
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,159
that you know set policy and wield a

419
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,600
tremendous amount of control over

420
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:55,679
society

421
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,639
and i think they have this notion that

422
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:58,879
you can tinker

423
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
society you can play with a few key

424
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,320
variables and tinker society

425
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,720
into a state that is desirable or good

426
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,399
and that's what they're trying to do and

427
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,600
i think the consequences of that can be

428
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,519
pretty bad

429
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,040
but no i don't think it's born out of

430
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:15,278
malevolence

431
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:16,399
there's an interesting idea i think

432
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,480
michael malus brought

433
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:21,039
up as a test whether you're on the left

434
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,039
or the right

435
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,519
the question he asks which is do you

436
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,720
think some people are better than

437
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,919
others if you say

438
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,320
yes he claims you're on the right if you

439
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,958
start

440
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,040
answering if you start like saying a lot

441
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:40,319
of things

442
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:42,480
like uh uh you're on the left

443
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,440
so if you start explaining yourself well

444
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,920
okay

445
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,639
yeah it's a good term for it i was

446
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:49,919
really

447
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,600
so in this in this test i suppose

448
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,679
i would be on the left because i'm

449
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,600
uncomfortable with the idea

450
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,120
that some people are better than others

451
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,440
as a basic

452
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,679
feeling as a starting point in the way

453
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,839
you think about the world because

454
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,000
as we're talking about everybody's a

455
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,760
hero of their own story

456
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,839
when you start to think some people are

457
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,879
better than others

458
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:16,079
as a starting axiom

459
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:20,879
it's like a slippery slope to where

460
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:23,198
you think you're way better than others

461
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,439
and then you start to like basically

462
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:27,120
it's okay to

463
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,480
take advantage of a large percent of the

464
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,560
population

465
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,480
for the greater good totally and then

466
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,039
you go into stalin mode

467
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,920
in hitler mode where it's okay to murder

468
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,719
a larger part

469
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:40,000
of the population for the greater good

470
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,079
so it's like it's this

471
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,198
very dangerous slippery slope in my mind

472
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,919
so i tried to

473
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:46,719
not uh i was always uncomfortable with

474
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,479
that kind of test

475
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,320
or even that kind of thought and yes the

476
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,079
same applies and suppose

477
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,480
in in government in central banking is

478
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,278
if you think some people are better than

479
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,560
others

480
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:03,679
applying your idea what is good can have

481
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:06,000
large-scale detrimental effects

482
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:08,399
of course yeah i i'm glad you didn't

483
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,958
pose me the question

484
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,639
i mean i think it maybe not the left

485
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:15,198
right axiom isn't

486
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,159
uh the disjunction isn't the way i would

487
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,000
sort of

488
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:22,719
put it but um you know to me it's just

489
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,078
if you reason in a consequentialist way

490
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,519
you know that lends itself to

491
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,679
authoritarianism

492
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,919
yeah where whereby you think you can

493
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,919
shape society and only you can shape

494
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:34,838
society in a positive direction

495
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:36,240
according to your you know specific

496
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:38,079
objectives

497
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,560
so let's step onto the land of

498
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:44,239
sturdiness that is bitcoin

499
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:45,119
what is bitcoin and um in your view what

500
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,639
are

501
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,440
you know the principles the

502
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,799
philosophical foundations of bitcoin

503
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,480
well bitcoin the term i think refers to

504
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:57,838
two things specifically

505
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,320
so one is the protocol for conveying

506
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,759
value through communications channel

507
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,160
so just a set of rules that we

508
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,599
collectively opt into

509
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,880
in order to transact online or just add

510
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,519
a distance

511
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,160
and then the other thing is the name of

512
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,959
the

513
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,759
asset the sort of monetary unit which

514
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,078
circulates

515
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,679
within the system and that always

516
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,119
confuse people a lot because it's like

517
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,798
well you've got uppercase bitcoin

518
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,318
lowercase bitcoin

519
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,798
why didn't satoshi just give them

520
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:27,918
different names like in ethereum you've

521
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:30,319
got ethereum

522
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,600
the system and then ether although

523
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:33,119
people don't really talk about ether

524
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,240
very much but

525
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:38,639
they you know chose to distinguish them

526
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,079
in bitcoin for whatever reason they're

527
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,480
not distinct

528
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,199
uh so the two bitcoins get co-mingled

529
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,919
all the time

530
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,600
in the explanations did you find that's

531
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,880
a problem that confuses things

532
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,558
i mean what's what's really a

533
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,440
distinction between the protocol and the

534
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,240
currency

535
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
well they are sometimes uh distinguished

536
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,359
practically

537
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,038
like you can transact with bitcoin

538
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,479
outside of the bitcoin protocol for

539
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,200
instance right

540
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,319
uh so you know you can transact with

541
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,519
bitcoin on

542
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,639
ethereum or i have bitcoin on an open

543
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,240
dime here

544
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,080
this would be a bitcoin transaction it

545
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,519
wouldn't settle on the bitcoin network

546
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:15,839
do you mind explaining what you have on

547
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,160
the table before us yeah so i brought

548
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,359
you

549
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,279
some presents this is awesome this isn't

550
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,959
a bribe this is just a proof of concept

551
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:26,558
okay so this is basically

552
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,840
um a bitcoin bearer

553
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,960
instrument so i put 100 bucks of bitcoin

554
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,119
on here

555
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,319
and to spend it you have to basically

556
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:35,599
physically destroy

557
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:38,319
part of the device you have to poke a

558
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,240
hole and um you know poke off one of the

559
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,359
little transistors on this

560
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,839
so it can only be spent once uh

561
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:47,279
so and you can't extract the private key

562
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,639
from this device

563
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:50,798
so the private key was generated on

564
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,840
device always stays on the device

565
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:57,119
so what it means without uh

566
00:18:53,839 --> 00:19:00,639
like breaking off like a small part so

567
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:02,639
this basically is a way to physically

568
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,759
instantiate bitcoin

569
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,038
so it's um it's kind of

570
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,798
cold yeah effectively so here thank you

571
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,038
so much this one's limited edition it's

572
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,759
orange

573
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,480
so what is it called again open dime the

574
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,000
point is

575
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,519
if you wanted to settle a bitcoin

576
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,519
transaction instantly

577
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,599
the kind of same way that a cash

578
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,798
transaction is instant final settlement

579
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,439
right you would do it with a device like

580
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,160
this so

581
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,440
if i was buying a house from you you

582
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,960
know

583
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,960
you might prefer to do it with a

584
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,360
physical bearer instrument

585
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,000
as opposed to waiting for a confirmation

586
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:40,879
on the bitcoin

587
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,839
blockchain so the moment i hand that

588
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,400
over to you

589
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,240
goes in your possession you're the owner

590
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,440
there's no way for me to have retained

591
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,120
the private key like

592
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,120
i could have created a bitcoin paper

593
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,038
wallet and given that to you but

594
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:55,759
you have no assurance that i didn't copy

595
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,679
down that you know the key elsewhere

596
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:59,119
so this solves that problem so this is a

597
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,400
physical instantiation

598
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:04,798
of the the bitcoin uh

599
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,519
transaction outside the bitcoin protocol

600
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:07,200
that's right

601
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,960
this is you're transacting the currency

602
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,000
outside of the protocol so it's analog

603
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,720
bitcoin we're

604
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,558
we're running an analog which i always

605
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,279
like because bitcoin is this immaterial

606
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,079
thing

607
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,918
and so it's nice to have physical totems

608
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:20,240
how much does it cost to manufacture

609
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,360
this

610
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,519
you know like 15 bucks or something

611
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,119
is it so this is just kind of a almost

612
00:20:25,519 --> 00:20:31,359
like a philosophical statement

613
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:33,918
versus um something that's scalable for

614
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,678
for use like you know the point of

615
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:36,480
bitcoin is to be in the digital space

616
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,038
right but

617
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:41,519
this shows like bitcoin can be anywhere

618
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:44,079
it's useful for gifts but yeah i mean

619
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:45,440
i don't know if it would be a suitable

620
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,839
foundation for a physical

621
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,279
bitcoin economy in theory these would be

622
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,480
like cash-like instruments that you

623
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:52,639
could use to transact

624
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,759
well i just mean post-apocalypse yeah

625
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,840
yeah but

626
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,158
you still need you still need to plug it

627
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:01,038
into your laptop to actually verify

628
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,960
that there's coins on there so you still

629
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,279
need the internet

630
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,400
so i have to take your uh word for how

631
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,599
much money is on here

632
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,240
no i mean you can you can plug it in

633
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,279
and check yeah but to transact to

634
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,599
extract

635
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,839
bitcoin from this i need to break yeah

636
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:19,918
you have to poke a hole through the

637
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,599
the little hole and that renders it

638
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,640
spendable exactly

639
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,480
so you know that's protection again so

640
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,840
you spending it and then representing

641
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,798
that it's still loaded that's

642
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,798
fascinating

643
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:32,879
cool yeah so that the other thing i

644
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:36,960
brought you're basically dice

645
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,679
uh 12-sided they don't have any bitcoin

646
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,679
on them

647
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,280
so they just have a bunch of different

648
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:45,280
critiques of bitcoin on each side

649
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,038
uh we'll go through them then this is

650
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:48,240
awesome i i don't know if we have time

651
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,400
to do all 11

652
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,679
because there's one with my funds logo

653
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,679
on it but um

654
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,720
it's just basically a tongue-in-cheek

655
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,880
joke that

656
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,558
the critiques of bitcoin are so formalic

657
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,440
at this point that you can just put them

658
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,798
on dice

659
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,600
yeah um it's it's silly

660
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,798
well some of them might be topics for

661
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,038
interesting conversations

662
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,558
oh yeah we can even arrange the

663
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,158
conversation that way you can roll the

664
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,440
dice and see what you got

665
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,880
all right but first uh the

666
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,720
the philosophical foundation is a

667
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,320
bitcoin like how do you see bitcoin

668
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,120
outside of just

669
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:24,639
a basic protocol and a basic currency it

670
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:27,678
seems to be like you said

671
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,320
uh it seems like sturdy ground so what

672
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,798
do you mean by

673
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:32,399
yeah yeah so it's not just any protocol

674
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,798
for moving valley around it's not just

675
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:38,159
any currency it's got specific

676
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,918
rules and values that are embedded in it

677
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,320
and this is an important point as the

678
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:45,280
bitcoin is the encoding

679
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,319
of certain values which are often

680
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:49,359
misunderstood

681
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:52,000
or not acknowledged necessarily

682
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:52,959
um and so it's sort of impregnated with

683
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,400
values

684
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,558
and what they are specifically is a

685
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,360
topic of debate and there have been

686
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,639
civil wars fought over the values

687
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,119
inherent in bitcoin

688
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,679
you know one of them was should bitcoin

689
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,639
be this

690
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,240
cheap scalable the base layer low fee

691
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,200
payments system

692
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,400
with an emphasis on pdp payments or

693
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:16,000
should it be more of this

694
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,480
like gold like digital commodity

695
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,519
that would eventually settle

696
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,519
infrequently

697
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:23,599
and mainly between institutions right so

698
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,639
that's fundamentally a conflict of

699
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,678
visions

700
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,440
right uh but the so

701
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,038
you know keep in mind that this is just

702
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,240
one man's opinion i don't speak for

703
00:23:31,038 --> 00:23:36,079
bitcoin

704
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,919
right so i would say the key the key

705
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,279
number one value that's embedded in

706
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,919
bitcoin is the notion of

707
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:44,399
non-discretionary monetary policy

708
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,360
so algorithmic monetary policy as

709
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,080
opposed to human

710
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,439
based monetary policy satoshi was very

711
00:23:48,079 --> 00:23:50,158
clear about that bitcoin is an

712
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,519
alternative

713
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:56,240
to modern central banking where you have

714
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:56,798
constant tweaking constant intervention

715
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,278
which

716
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:00,319
satoshi felt leads to credit bubbles and

717
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,200
so on

718
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:06,158
so bitcoin proposes a completely

719
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,440
non-discretionary monetary policy

720
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,799
um sort of decays over time 50

721
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,960
of the coins were issued in the first

722
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:15,278
four years and then the next 25

723
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,960
the next four years then 12 and a half

724
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:19,359
percent in the next four years

725
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,120
until you get to 21 million units and

726
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,199
none of those numbers really matter

727
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:24,959
like it could have been 25 million units

728
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,038
and it could have been a more aggressive

729
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,759
slope or more gradual slope

730
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,879
but what matters is that this schedule

731
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:34,000
was proposed

732
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,679
even before the code was public the

733
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,599
schedule was proposed

734
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,200
and then we all collectively agreed to

735
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,599
stick to it

736
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,038
and that is kind of a first for monetary

737
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,359
system

738
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:46,319
i mean gold kind of has that property

739
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,240
right because

740
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,759
goal the supply of gold above ground

741
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,880
only really increases at one to two

742
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,359
percent a year

743
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,880
so it's it's sort of inhuman which is a

744
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,278
good feature right you don't want to

745
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:00,720
give humans that much control over it

746
00:24:57,278 --> 00:25:02,798
bitcoin is a much more

747
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,759
you know fastidious approach to that it

748
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:08,000
really is super concrete about what the

749
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,839
supply schedule is and the fact

750
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,798
crucially that it can't change

751
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:13,918
so we can't have a bailout of debt

752
00:25:12,798 --> 00:25:15,278
debtors

753
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,840
a lot of people would say a lot of

754
00:25:15,278 --> 00:25:18,880
people had debts denominated in bitcoin

755
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:20,959
and we needed loose

756
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,919
accommodative monetary policy to bail

757
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,319
them out that's not possible we couldn't

758
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,840
have a jubilee denominated in bitcoin

759
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,319
because the social contract

760
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,000
we've all you know bought into and

761
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,480
committed to

762
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,000
is that it's not just non-discretionary

763
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,120
so that's sort of one of the first

764
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,519
things

765
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,319
um and i think ultimately that comes

766
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:42,639
back to

767
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,079
basically a strong respect for property

768
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,640
rights

769
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,678
because if we were to have unanticipated

770
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,360
inflation let's say

771
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,440
you know really charismatic leader

772
00:25:49,359 --> 00:25:52,798
somehow commandeered bitcoin and

773
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,080
convinced everyone that we should have

774
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:58,240
30 million units and not 21 million

775
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,278
that would basically be dilutive on

776
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,319
everybody that

777
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:05,599
held bitcoin and had opted into the

778
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:07,839
21 million set of coins

779
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,439
an additional 9 million unanticipated

780
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:10,158
would have a dilutive effect on everyone

781
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,840
else

782
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,440
and that would be a covert way of

783
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:13,918
effectively stealing their purchasing

784
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,600
power

785
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,360
through inflation is that possible that

786
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,199
kind of thing i mean uh

787
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,199
what what's the mechanism of bitcoin

788
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,159
that resists that kind of charismatic

789
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,360
leader

790
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:26,880
well we've had people that have had

791
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:29,199
a lot of influence in bitcoin in the

792
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,480
past and they've tried to make changes

793
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,919
to the protocol not as

794
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,400
dramatic as that but bitcoiners

795
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:37,278
have generally resisted those

796
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,679
individuals

797
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,200
institutions and they you know

798
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,960
bitcoiners have a good track record of

799
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,278
sort of staying true to

800
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,400
to those core values so that you know

801
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,278
the you mentioned

802
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,640
values and and like sticking to the

803
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,679
monetary thing

804
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,679
but there's bigger values uh

805
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,519
there's almost like psychological values

806
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,320
that are instilled in bitcoin uh you

807
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,679
make a point

808
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:05,278
that bitcoin for many is a vessel quote

809
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:09,200
for their expectations hopes and dreams

810
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:10,720
uh can uh the bitcoin protocol support

811
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,000
this kind of complexity of

812
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,759
the human condition so like there's

813
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,480
ideas of freedom

814
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:21,679
that seem to be spoken about there's a

815
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:25,038
sort of ideas of um

816
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,720
of i mean even love yeah i mean

817
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:28,960
some people kind of use it as a meme

818
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,759
like you know bitcoin is love or

819
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,640
something like that

820
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,079
you know mostly to troll me because i

821
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,799
talk about love all the time

822
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,158
but you know these bigger ideas than

823
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:41,839
just

824
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:45,039
the exchange of currencies yeah i mean

825
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,879
bitcoin itself is very uh simple i would

826
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:50,079
say like ultimately

827
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,880
it doesn't you know pretend to do very

828
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:56,639
much it really just settles transactions

829
00:27:52,880 --> 00:28:00,240
um but people do superimpose their own

830
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,080
views on it for sure um and bitcoin's

831
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,038
qualities give rise

832
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,398
to these perceptions of it having

833
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:09,519
censorship resistance

834
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:12,158
or giving you transactional freedom or a

835
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:15,759
measure of transactional privacy

836
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:17,840
so because anyone can

837
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,359
operate a node and join the consensus

838
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,158
process and because mining is a

839
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:25,678
competitive free market process

840
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:28,320
that means that it's likely that

841
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,519
you can't be censored by the miners so

842
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:31,038
that means you have transactional

843
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:33,519
freedom so you have these

844
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,278
computer science technical features of

845
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,679
the system that cause it to have these

846
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:40,319
political qualities which is

847
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,559
it's very hard or impossible to censor a

848
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,439
specific individual

849
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,398
so it's it's interesting to see that

850
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,399
flow

851
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,959
but so that's one of the core values for

852
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,558
sure is the censorship resistance

853
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,278
then you have the fact that it's a

854
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,200
cryptographic based system

855
00:28:55,278 --> 00:29:00,240
and uh you can hold value in your brain

856
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,798
by memorizing 12 words for instance

857
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,720
that gives it seizure resistance which

858
00:29:02,798 --> 00:29:06,158
is again a political concept if you

859
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,558
wanted to

860
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,120
desert your jurisdiction with your

861
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,678
wealth intact in your brain

862
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,278
you know that you know cryptographic

863
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,360
feature of the system the fact that it's

864
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,599
built on public key cryptography

865
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,719
and that you can encode a bitcoin

866
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,000
private key

867
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,120
in 12 words that gives it this political

868
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,359
salience

869
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,158
that you know you can you're now

870
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,119
empowered

871
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,520
relative to a despot basically yeah i

872
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,918
mean

873
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,558
there's so many beautiful concepts

874
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,080
behind

875
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:40,319
cryptocurrency behind bitcoin that

876
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:41,839
stand for sort of freedom some of the

877
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,639
basic things that the founding of this

878
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,278
country

879
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:46,159
the one thing i don't like personally

880
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:48,720
behind

881
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,080
uh bitcoin and cryptocurrency is that

882
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,000
money's involved

883
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,678
and it's like people's life savings

884
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,200
sometimes are involved

885
00:29:53,679 --> 00:30:00,240
so there is naturally a kind of

886
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,519
fear a self-preservation

887
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:05,278
uh like instinctual kind of dogmatic

888
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,599
thing that comes in

889
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,599
where you're not the best of human

890
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,639
nature you're you stop being a george

891
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,278
washington

892
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,038
and you lose touch of the like

893
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,558
foundational principles which i think

894
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,079
are beautiful just like the founding

895
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,119
principles of this country

896
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:22,000
so that's that's just like um so i like

897
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,199
staying on the

898
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,558
level of like the philosophy versus the

899
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,440
level of like all my money is invested

900
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:32,240
in bitcoin

901
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,159
and that that becomes very tricky

902
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,000
territory to have

903
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:39,840
principal discussions yeah about ideas

904
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,839
well it's an interesting intention i try

905
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:44,158
to stay balanced despite being very

906
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:46,720
exposed to bitcoin so

907
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,360
let me ask the ridiculous question just

908
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,399
in case

909
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:52,398
who's satoshi is it you

910
00:30:50,398 --> 00:30:55,278
we don't know it's probably not me

911
00:30:52,398 --> 00:31:00,319
because i was

912
00:30:55,278 --> 00:31:04,000
um like 17 when satoshi mounted bitcoin

913
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:07,119
16. so unlikely and also i'm not really

914
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,640
a programmer so um

915
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:09,918
there's a lot of theories but honestly

916
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,960
it's one of the greatest mysteries of

917
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,600
all time because

918
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,079
even bitcoins that have been around

919
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,439
since

920
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,000
day one really you know people that were

921
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,759
around

922
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,038
before bitcoin came out they're on the

923
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,960
mailing list they were active in the

924
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,798
cypherpunk community

925
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,960
you asked someone they sincerely will

926
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:27,759
not know and they may not even have a

927
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,079
good guess

928
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,919
as to who satoshi is is it important to

929
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:32,879
know or is it like actually important

930
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,480
not to know

931
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,919
do you think that's a feature or bug

932
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,679
that you we don't know

933
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:40,159
some people don't like the uncertainty

934
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,159
especially you know folks on wall street

935
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:45,919
they really want to know

936
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:48,720
and uh if you read the coinbase s1 their

937
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:50,960
disclosure pre-ipo that's a risk factor

938
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,000
that satoshi could come back

939
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,960
so the the risk management crowd wants

940
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,640
to know

941
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,640
because they want to know if maybe

942
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,399
satoshi had you know

943
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:02,159
undesirable political opinions or

944
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:02,798
something that would forever taint the

945
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,000
project

946
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,079
do you think they were just trolling

947
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,679
with that risk with the

948
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:11,038
satoshi's identity being a risk factor

949
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,798
or is that like actual

950
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:14,960
like was there an actual meeting and a

951
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,798
discussion of that being a risk factor

952
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,558
i think in the risk factor sections of

953
00:32:16,798 --> 00:32:20,319
the prospectuses it's really just the

954
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:21,759
lawyers doing a total brain dump to

955
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:23,599
cover absolutely everything they can

956
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:24,879
think of so it's just lawyers it's not

957
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,319
like

958
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,840
uh you know it's like i think elon was

959
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:31,439
somewhere in the legal documents where

960
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,480
spacex

961
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,480
mentioned that like uh earth governments

962
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,319
have no jurisdiction on mars

963
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,159
like they threw that in there and it

964
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,319
feels like yeah that could be lawyers

965
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,000
but it could also just be elon trolling

966
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:46,079
yeah so i wonder if it's like the

967
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,119
coinbase folks trolling

968
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:51,119
or if uh i don't know if it's lawyers i

969
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,359
hope it's the trolling not the lawyers

970
00:32:51,119 --> 00:32:54,319
the the coinbase leadership they're not

971
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,199
as big uh

972
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,879
trolls as elon is but uh i mean it's a

973
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,558
it's a risk for sure from their

974
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,720
perspective because

975
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:04,319
let's say satoshi returned doesn't seem

976
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,759
likely and let's say they decided to

977
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:08,960
spend all their coins

978
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,000
which also seems very unlikely um that's

979
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,960
you know

980
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,960
rumored to be or estimates have it at 1

981
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,880
to 1.2 million

982
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,798
bitcoin which is like 50 60 billion

983
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,960
dollars worth

984
00:33:20,798 --> 00:33:24,639
so some people consider that to be a

985
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,038
risk you think it's

986
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,559
uh you know this is almost like a topic

987
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:30,798
of leadership

988
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:34,398
it doesn't feel like anybody any one

989
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:37,599
person speaks for bitcoin

990
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:40,639
not there's not even like prominent

991
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,959
figures like you have for like ethereum

992
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,759
you have vitalik buterin

993
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,038
it doesn't there's a lot of like top

994
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,919
minds talking about

995
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,960
like yourself but it's not like one or

996
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,640
two

997
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:54,399
do you think again is that a feature or

998
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,480
a bug like uh

999
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:58,000
do you think for effective for bitcoin

1000
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,440
to effectively

1001
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,398
have a role in um society that like

1002
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,960
is as large or larger than the dollar

1003
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:09,118
there needs to be like

1004
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,878
leadership that represents it almost

1005
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,039
like democratic kind of thing

1006
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:14,960
well that's a real counter-intuitive

1007
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,719
point because most bitcoiners including

1008
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,599
myself would say no the lack of

1009
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,158
leadership is

1010
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,919
a great quality to have because if you

1011
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,079
have a charismatic leader and a

1012
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,960
foundation or corporation that controls

1013
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,800
it

1014
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:29,119
maybe they can control the features of

1015
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,639
the protocol and maybe they can

1016
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,599
expropriate holders of the coin or

1017
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,878
you know build in an endowment that pays

1018
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:39,119
them off and

1019
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,598
gives them privileged access to the

1020
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,399
units of the coin for instance so

1021
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,399
you know we call people that have

1022
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:49,598
privileged access to the money spigot

1023
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,598
cantillon insiders which is there's this

1024
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,240
economist that pointed out that

1025
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:56,480
as you know i think richard county on

1026
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:59,118
that as money enters the economy has an

1027
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,400
uneven flow right so you see this in the

1028
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,519
last

1029
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,200
last decade or so before that too

1030
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:06,800
the consequence of money printing in

1031
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,159
this country is people that own

1032
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,599
financial assets

1033
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,000
made a lot of money and people that

1034
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:14,240
didn't didn't so you see that

1035
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,280
cantelon insider cantelon outsider

1036
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,159
effect

1037
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:19,519
and it's the same with a cryptocurrency

1038
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:20,719
in many other alternative

1039
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:23,759
cryptocurrencies that do

1040
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,279
have these corporate entities or these

1041
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,359
leaders and ceos

1042
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,640
they're able to make specific decisions

1043
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:30,159
regarding

1044
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,078
the protocol and the currency of the

1045
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:33,759
asset the benefit themselves their

1046
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,079
cronies etc

1047
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,960
and that's not a good feature to have i

1048
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,160
mean

1049
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,838
it does grant you you know the ability

1050
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:45,039
to orchestrate decisions

1051
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,880
in a faster and more efficient way but

1052
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:48,880
long term what you're trying to optimize

1053
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:51,519
for if you're creating a money

1054
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,880
is monetary credibility and soundness so

1055
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,159
you don't really want it changing all

1056
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,519
that often

1057
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:57,440
and you don't want to have the

1058
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:59,519
appearance of

1059
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,159
you know these elites that are engaging

1060
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:03,199
in rent seeking or anything like that so

1061
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,639
there's definitely people that are

1062
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,719
influential in bitcoin there's core

1063
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,118
developers that people listen to because

1064
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:09,519
it's

1065
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,119
i would say meritocracy largely and

1066
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,039
they're sort of self-appointed high

1067
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,960
priest of the protocol

1068
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:16,800
i write a lot about bitcoin people

1069
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,519
listen to me but it's a completely free

1070
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,839
market

1071
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,320
of ideas right i don't have any

1072
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:24,400
authority within bitcoin whatsoever

1073
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,760
i'm just a scribbler you know you use

1074
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,599
the scribbles

1075
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:32,640
so was aristotle uh socrates

1076
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,920
and nietzsche okay at the high

1077
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,799
level uh technically how does bitcoin

1078
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,480
work

1079
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,320
is there interesting things you could

1080
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,159
say like what are minors

1081
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,440
what are nodes full nodes what are

1082
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:46,719
blocks

1083
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,760
what's proof of work is there uh a nice

1084
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,799
way to wrap up

1085
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,200
a clean explanation of the protocol oh

1086
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,960
man

1087
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,519
that's uh that could be a whole that

1088
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,119
could be another five hours

1089
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:58,960
is there interesting because i'd love to

1090
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,760
talk to you about block size wars and

1091
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,159
sort of the

1092
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,760
the the politics psychology the

1093
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:05,358
principles around that but sort of

1094
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,119
building up to that it'd be nice to talk

1095
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:08,880
about how the thing works

1096
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,358
that's fair i mean and the block size

1097
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,640
wars are really fascinating

1098
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:17,759
discussion of how governance debates

1099
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:21,759
intersect with technical features um

1100
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:24,320
so i guess we can yeah so basically

1101
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,040
at the highest possible level bitcoin is

1102
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,240
a

1103
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:30,400
globally shared uh it's really a

1104
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,719
replicated ledger that

1105
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,720
um any participant that wants to be an

1106
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,439
equal peer on that ledger

1107
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:38,959
they want to maintain that ledger and

1108
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,000
they want to stay up to date with the

1109
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:43,679
global state

1110
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,639
of the ledger and really any monetary

1111
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:48,480
system is just

1112
00:37:44,639 --> 00:37:50,078
a ledger with physical cash

1113
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,599
we benefit from the physical

1114
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,920
instantiation

1115
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,079
of the money so the physics is the

1116
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,680
ledger the physics is a ledger right

1117
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,519
same with gold right you can't just

1118
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:03,519
produce new units of gold

1119
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,559
so we trust that gold atoms are hard to

1120
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:07,599
create

1121
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,239
um although not impossible right um you

1122
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,440
could uh

1123
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:14,000
fire a bunch of protons and whatever is

1124
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,679
the adjacent metal uh and create gold

1125
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,679
atoms would be expensive

1126
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:18,960
uh and the same with dollars you know we

1127
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:19,598
trust that it's hard to counterfeit a

1128
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,800
dollar

1129
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,720
so we trust the physical analog world to

1130
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,240
help maintain the state of that ledger

1131
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,639
with digital money

1132
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:29,439
like um you know the money in your bank

1133
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:32,480
account

1134
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,559
your checking account we basically trust

1135
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,639
our institutions or banking institutions

1136
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:38,159
to keep a faithful record

1137
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,039
and then ultimately we trust the central

1138
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:43,358
bank to administer that system

1139
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,199
so there's kind of a handful of nodes in

1140
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:46,719
bitcoin we trust that the economic

1141
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:50,319
incentives of the system

1142
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:52,559
are carefully poised basically so

1143
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,760
we trust that the free market mining

1144
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,159
competition

1145
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,960
will lead to the miners assembling

1146
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:59,118
transactions

1147
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,079
into blocks in a faithful and correct

1148
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,000
way

1149
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:04,960
and that we are going to converge on a

1150
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,358
global state of the ledger continuously

1151
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,960
which updates every 10 minutes or so

1152
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:11,598
with some variants

1153
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,079
and then the miners aren't the sole

1154
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,720
entities that control the system to

1155
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,720
really

1156
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,078
participate if you're a merchant and

1157
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:19,598
you're accepting bitcoin

1158
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,680
you really want to run your own full

1159
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,480
node and check the whole history of

1160
00:39:21,679 --> 00:39:25,118
transactions

1161
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:26,960
sort of something like when i say five

1162
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,480
to 600 million transactions that have

1163
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,240
ever occurred on bitcoin

1164
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,880
so full node contains all the

1165
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:37,039
transactions ever transacted

1166
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,960
on the the bitcoin blockchain and that's

1167
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,199
i saw it's like 200 gigs or something

1168
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,679
like that it's like 350 something like

1169
00:39:41,199 --> 00:39:44,559
that

1170
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,598
it's doable on a regular consumer laptop

1171
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:47,920
and that is going to be

1172
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,760
really key later on in the discussion

1173
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,920
sure

1174
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,520
but so you know that's really the

1175
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,960
ultimate trust models first of all we

1176
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,039
trust that the miners that assemble

1177
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,119
transactions into blocks and

1178
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:01,039
they are the archivists you know they

1179
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,000
inscribe those transactions onto the

1180
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:04,318
ledger

1181
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,838
and they have an economic incentive to

1182
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,239
sort of behave correctly because they're

1183
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:09,279
getting

1184
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,719
paid and no units of bitcoin that's part

1185
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:13,599
of it but then really

1186
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,919
you are also you're not fully trusting

1187
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,119
them

1188
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:17,358
you're actually if you want to run a

1189
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,039
node you replay every single transaction

1190
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:21,199
in the history of bitcoin

1191
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,960
from the beginning to the current day

1192
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:23,759
and you arrive at the present state that

1193
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,838
way

1194
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,000
so you don't really have to trust too

1195
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:31,039
many people or entities

1196
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,559
you can validate the correctness of that

1197
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:34,000
all the rules have been followed

1198
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,920
that all the bitcoins that were created

1199
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,800
were done so in the valid

1200
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,519
way that the inflation rate was adhered

1201
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,000
to

1202
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,119
and that there's no covert inflation you

1203
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,760
know that

1204
00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:48,480
if you're spending 50 units of bitcoin

1205
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,520
uh you had that bitcoin to spend

1206
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,400
in the first place uh so it's sort of

1207
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:56,960
delicately poised between node operators

1208
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,760
who who you know engage in this validity

1209
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,838
checking

1210
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,599
kind of anti-counterfeiting checking and

1211
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:03,199
then also the miners which are an

1212
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,000
industrial entity

1213
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,639
and they basically produce block space

1214
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,960
and

1215
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:11,679
assemble transactions in the box and

1216
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:13,760
everybody so the miners are incentivized

1217
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,358
to not mess with the system because

1218
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,560
they're getting value from the system

1219
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:21,920
so if they mess with it it's going to

1220
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:24,239
decrease the value of their physical

1221
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,159
work investment yeah so they have to

1222
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:30,559
incur a real physical cost

1223
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:33,759
to produce a block right so right now

1224
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,440
you get uh 6.25 bitcoins in a block at a

1225
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,760
minimum and then maybe some fees

1226
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,559
as well and how hard is it to produce a

1227
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,000
block now

1228
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:44,078
well challenging i mean you need uh

1229
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,599
so six point two five bitcoins and a

1230
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,880
bitcoin's worth fifty five thousand

1231
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,039
dollars or so

1232
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,079
so it's probably going to cost you about

1233
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,639
that amount

1234
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,599
to produce it because it's a free market

1235
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,559
competition

1236
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,359
and miners have very free thin margins

1237
00:41:56,559 --> 00:41:59,759
so

1238
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:01,440
it's like if i auction off a dollar you

1239
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,920
would pay up to 99 cents

1240
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,000
to buy that dollar for me it's exactly

1241
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,280
what happens with miners

1242
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,838
they're you know basically competing for

1243
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,760
the right

1244
00:42:09,838 --> 00:42:13,358
to obtain new units of money so

1245
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,200
logically speaking

1246
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,639
they would pay up to the value of that

1247
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:18,879
money in order to earn it

1248
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:20,159
and for people who are not familiar the

1249
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,559
process of mining

1250
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:23,519
is solving a difficult cryptographic

1251
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:25,519
problem

1252
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,800
that's a computational problem it's i

1253
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:28,639
would say it's not like

1254
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,000
people sometimes represent it as like a

1255
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,239
really challenging puzzle

1256
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,599
like the individual puzzle is very

1257
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,039
simple like you can do with pen and

1258
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:38,079
paper if you wanted

1259
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,358
you know like shawn 256 it's just that

1260
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,680
you're searching through the big

1261
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,039
mathematical space to find the needle in

1262
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:44,960
the haystack

1263
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,279
you're just doing lots of iterations of

1264
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,599
a simple puzzle that's just brute force

1265
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,960
hence like the stability of of the whole

1266
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,960
idea of the proof of work

1267
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,400
if it was a if you if there was a

1268
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:57,280
shortcut it wouldn't be

1269
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,240
it wouldn't work exactly so let's hope

1270
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,040
nobody

1271
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,159
solves sha-256 yeah there's a lot of

1272
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:04,400
discussions in

1273
00:43:02,159 --> 00:43:06,239
from the quantum computing space but

1274
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,400
everybody i i talk to

1275
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,439
all my colleagues and that work on

1276
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,639
quantum computers

1277
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:15,280
uh say this we're quite a way quite a

1278
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:17,118
long way away from that being an issue

1279
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,000
in uh cryptography and then and

1280
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,519
certainly in asian cryptocurrency

1281
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,760
that should have been one of the sides

1282
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,599
on these dice should have been quantum

1283
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,359
because i don't think it is i forgot to

1284
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:30,880
put on this edition

1285
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,880
people should check out scott aaronson

1286
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,560
there's a lot of people that are kind of

1287
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:37,679
um

1288
00:43:34,559 --> 00:43:38,960
selling quantum snake oil so you should

1289
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:41,358
be very careful

1290
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,639
i think it is a really exciting space

1291
00:43:41,358 --> 00:43:45,920
that might

1292
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:48,879
change the world in the next decade or

1293
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:50,240
100 couple hundred years uh especially

1294
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,440
for simulating quantum mechanical

1295
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:54,318
systems

1296
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,760
but in quantum machine learning uh

1297
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:56,719
people should check out tensorflow

1298
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,640
quantum

1299
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,078
it's a nice way to sort of educate

1300
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,838
yourself about the space

1301
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,240
and actually if you're pragmatically

1302
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:06,159
minded to

1303
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,000
you know through software engineering

1304
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,000
explore how you simulate quantum

1305
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,199
circuits how you run machine learning on

1306
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,838
those quantum circuits

1307
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,960
the the main point that scott makes

1308
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,039
scott erinson

1309
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,400
people should check out his blog too is

1310
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:20,960
that like

1311
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:22,639
there's not yet a single machine

1312
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:25,280
learning application

1313
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:27,279
that doesn't do almost as well on a

1314
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:30,319
classical computer so it doesn't

1315
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,359
like yes the dream is somehow

1316
00:44:30,318 --> 00:44:34,159
uh quantum computers will change the

1317
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:36,480
nature of

1318
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,480
artificial intelligence but there's yet

1319
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,240
to be an actual

1320
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,960
algorithm that uh or a problem set or a

1321
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,759
data set

1322
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,838
where that would be the case so

1323
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:50,640
skepticism is good in this space

1324
00:44:47,838 --> 00:44:51,599
anyway that said so you kind of

1325
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,799
explained

1326
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,280
uh how bitcoin works

1327
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,960
you also wrote a blog post recently

1328
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,400
giving a shout out to the new book

1329
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,400
the block size wars

1330
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,800
what is the block size what are the

1331
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,440
block size wars

1332
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,200
its history its importance its uh

1333
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,679
philosophical foundations

1334
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,679
yeah i mean bitcoin at this point we

1335
00:45:13,679 --> 00:45:16,559
have our own civil wars if you're

1336
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,279
wondering

1337
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,279
about how politically intense it gets

1338
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:24,880
it's currently not hot it's cold

1339
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,519
it's oh yeah we're in a dayton right now

1340
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,880
there's no tanks or missiles at least

1341
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:31,440
not yet hopefully

1342
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,599
it can get a little violent i guess i

1343
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,000
think one of the bitcoin core developers

1344
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,000
or

1345
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,760
one of the participants in the war got

1346
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,838
swatted at one point

1347
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,880
what's what it means when someone does a

1348
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,039
fight a fake

1349
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,800
uh phone call saying that you're holding

1350
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:46,480
someone hostage at your house and the

1351
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:49,599
swat team goes

1352
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,318
it's pretty scary wow internet warfare

1353
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:53,119
tactic

1354
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,960
yeah but uh the block size warf i would

1355
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,880
say effectively ended

1356
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,079
um although we're definitely gonna have

1357
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,039
more

1358
00:45:58,079 --> 00:46:03,920
civil wars in bitcoin for sure but

1359
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:05,759
basically the core argument was

1360
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,960
a technical one on its surface but a

1361
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,680
very deep

1362
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,800
political one at its core the technical

1363
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:13,519
question is

1364
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,599
how many megabytes should be in each

1365
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:18,239
successive block

1366
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:20,240
so satoshi basically installed a limit

1367
00:46:18,239 --> 00:46:22,719
of one megabyte per block

1368
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,439
so we should backtrack there was no

1369
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,759
limit

1370
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:26,639
in the beginning and it seems like

1371
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,359
satoshi

1372
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:32,078
what is this 2000 the war started in

1373
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,559
what 2017 or something like that

1374
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,359
i don't know when the 15 was when the

1375
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,960
you know

1376
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:40,159
the battlecry what was the first battle

1377
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,639
in the civil war

1378
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,239
i don't remember but sort of satoshi i

1379
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,318
don't know if you can comment it

1380
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,000
on it like why does satoshi set the

1381
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:51,599
limit to one megabyte

1382
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,239
all of a sudden almost secretively

1383
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:55,200
and in the beginning there was no limit

1384
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,279
whatsoever

1385
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:58,879
yeah i mean we can get into and people

1386
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:01,200
have spent thousands of hours poring

1387
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:03,680
over satoshi's writings to find

1388
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,960
you know which side satoshi was on and

1389
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,679
you can find

1390
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,039
like any textual exegesis you can find

1391
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,519
evidence for either

1392
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,358
side right but uh yeah i mean

1393
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:15,199
effectively when bitcoin was launched

1394
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:17,119
there was a block size because

1395
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,118
if you made a block over a certain size

1396
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:22,318
with the first edition of the code

1397
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,079
it would have crashed nodes but then

1398
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:25,199
yeah in 2010 satoshi added the one

1399
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,440
megabyte limit

1400
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,558
in a covert way with no comments or

1401
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,480
anything

1402
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:35,440
and uh that's stock basically and uh

1403
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,119
and then bitcoin blocks filled up and

1404
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,519
people that had been socialized into

1405
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,318
this vision of bitcoin as an effectively

1406
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:42,079
free

1407
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:43,440
transactional network like why pay a

1408
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,839
transaction fee

1409
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,280
if you're not at congestion if the block

1410
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:49,519
isn't full the miner will mine your

1411
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,480
transaction for free right

1412
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,039
um people that had been brought up in

1413
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,838
that

1414
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:59,358
status quo from 2009 to kind of 2015

1415
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:00,960
they noticed the blocks started to fill

1416
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:02,639
up and they're like okay well let's just

1417
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,318
remove this arbitrary limit

1418
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:06,078
right what what could possibly be the

1419
00:48:04,318 --> 00:48:08,880
harm right and then

1420
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,359
a whole other faction said no you need

1421
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,559
to

1422
00:48:09,358 --> 00:48:15,440
cap the data throughput of the system

1423
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,680
because if you increase it it's going to

1424
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,599
be highly exclusionary

1425
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:21,358
and ultimately regular folks are not

1426
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,760
going to be able to run a full node

1427
00:48:21,358 --> 00:48:26,159
so there's a fixed number this is a

1428
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:27,359
fixed frequency of blocks

1429
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,358
and so if you want to increase the

1430
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:32,000
number of transactions

1431
00:48:29,358 --> 00:48:32,880
per second you want to increase the size

1432
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,119
of the block so

1433
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:36,240
huge blocks allow you to shove in a lot

1434
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,240
of transactions

1435
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:40,639
right small blocks don't so that's what

1436
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:43,118
you mean like constraining the system

1437
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:46,639
so what's the benefit of a small block

1438
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,640
size where transactions

1439
00:48:46,639 --> 00:48:50,159
when you can squeeze in only a small

1440
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:52,318
number of transactions

1441
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:53,920
and what's the benefit of a huge block

1442
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:55,119
size where you can squeeze in a lot of

1443
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,358
transactions

1444
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,480
well it really comes down to the way you

1445
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:00,960
think about the system

1446
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,240
so a lot of people wanted bitcoin to be

1447
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:05,039
visa scale

1448
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:06,479
so to have blocks sufficiently large

1449
00:49:05,039 --> 00:49:10,079
that you could accommodate

1450
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:12,000
a visa level scale of transactions so

1451
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,039
which is many orders of magnitude more

1452
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:16,559
transactions that's right i mean

1453
00:49:14,039 --> 00:49:17,199
preposterously larger in terms of data

1454
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,839
throughput

1455
00:49:17,199 --> 00:49:22,799
then you know bitcoin offers up or at

1456
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:23,759
least it used to 144 megabytes of space

1457
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:25,760
per day

1458
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,520
and your average transaction is 350

1459
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:31,200
bytes so

1460
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:34,159
you know you could add a push to for 500

1461
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:36,799
000 transactions a day which is not many

1462
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:38,719
so if you wanted to get to visa scale

1463
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:42,318
you'd have to increase blocks

1464
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:44,078
obnoxiously large uh the small blockers

1465
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:46,318
claimed that this would

1466
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,200
overwhelm the ability of any regular

1467
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,000
person to

1468
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:52,078
ingest that data and stay current at the

1469
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,079
you know state of the ledger

1470
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,160
to rebroadca to replay all those

1471
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:58,079
transactions to ensure that the protocol

1472
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:00,879
rules were valid so basically

1473
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,480
the small blocker contention is that you

1474
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,358
eliminate the trustlessness

1475
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,039
of the system by pushing a ton of data

1476
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:08,000
through the system because only one or

1477
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:10,719
two

1478
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,079
industrial heavy duty nodes would ever

1479
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:15,199
be able to run

1480
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:17,119
the protocol at that point so by the way

1481
00:50:15,199 --> 00:50:19,199
in the civil war the two sides

1482
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,559
as you as you're calling them the small

1483
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:24,078
blocker and

1484
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:27,119
the big blocker sides and so that

1485
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:29,119
takes us back to the uh the thing that

1486
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,880
you mentioned that a regular computer

1487
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:34,800
could be a node

1488
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,800
and uh with a big with big blocks

1489
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,160
that's no longer going to be the case so

1490
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:41,599
just the number of transactions

1491
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:42,639
is going to blow up the size of the

1492
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,280
blockchain

1493
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,078
that every full node has to store and so

1494
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,440
then

1495
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,280
as opposed to a regular mom-and-pop

1496
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,039
type of node you're going to have to

1497
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,880
have data centers

1498
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,239
so they're going to have to be owned by

1499
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:58,079
large organizations there's going to

1500
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:59,598
have to be very few of them

1501
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,480
and that's how you centralize the

1502
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:06,400
control over this whole

1503
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:09,599
operation so the big blocker

1504
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,119
yes it allows you to be visa and do a

1505
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,559
huge number of transactions but it

1506
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,318
becomes centralized and the small

1507
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:17,280
blockers

1508
00:51:14,318 --> 00:51:19,199
you cannot actually do kind of merchant

1509
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:21,839
style transactions

1510
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:23,759
but you get the decentralized benefit

1511
00:51:21,838 --> 00:51:25,440
well i don't even think the big block

1512
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,160
approach would allow you to be visa

1513
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,480
frankly

1514
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:29,679
because there's effectively one node at

1515
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,920
the visa network

1516
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:33,679
right so you don't really need to

1517
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,200
maintain this peer-to-peer architecture

1518
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:36,960
at all

1519
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:38,239
and the amount of data you'd have to

1520
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,838
push through the network

1521
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:41,358
to reach visa scale is a really

1522
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,639
preposterous amount

1523
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:45,279
i mean and we have now evidence for what

1524
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:46,639
happens

1525
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,240
when you try and scale up as a

1526
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:50,000
blockchain and do 10 million

1527
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:53,118
transactions a day which is still not

1528
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:55,679
visa scale right you know

1529
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,480
i've i've you know seen what it's like

1530
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,199
to operate

1531
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,559
those nodes and it's not pretty so there

1532
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:04,639
are totally

1533
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:07,680
genuine computer science physical limits

1534
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:09,358
because it's a it's a broadcast network

1535
00:52:07,679 --> 00:52:10,879
everyone has to be aware of every

1536
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,358
transaction

1537
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:15,519
and that model which gives you the

1538
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:17,199
trustlessness the nice guarantees where

1539
00:52:15,519 --> 00:52:19,039
everyone's an equal peer on the network

1540
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:21,118
everyone has audited the full

1541
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:23,279
history of the transactions that model

1542
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,720
falls apart under stress

1543
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,440
so the small block of vision is that

1544
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:30,399
ultimately you would scale in a layered

1545
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,318
approach

1546
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,559
with the base layer transactions being

1547
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:36,000
settlement style transactions

1548
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,640
and you know payments happening at the

1549
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,039
other layers basically

1550
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,279
is that universally agreed upon or like

1551
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:45,279
to a large degree agreed upon that the

1552
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,800
small blockers have won in this

1553
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:50,720
in this debate well where would you put

1554
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:52,720
the the current state of affairs

1555
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:54,000
there was a wave of competing bitcoin

1556
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:57,358
implementations

1557
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:59,760
in starting in 2015 with bitcoin xt

1558
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:02,400
um actually gavin anderson who is the

1559
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,800
guy that satoshi handed the reins to

1560
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:05,680
when satoshi left gavin supported this

1561
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,119
large

1562
00:53:05,679 --> 00:53:09,919
block proposal uh and so that was that

1563
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,760
didn't achieve

1564
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,039
consensus and then there was bitcoin

1565
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:16,720
unlimited

1566
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:17,679
and then later on there was a genuine

1567
00:53:16,719 --> 00:53:20,000
hard fork

1568
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,358
where the small blockers couldn't or the

1569
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,800
large blockers couldn't push through

1570
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:24,799
their proposals

1571
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,880
on bitcoin itself so they just created a

1572
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,160
competing version of bitcoin you know so

1573
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,680
by the way uh

1574
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:32,159
maybe you can comment on but sort of

1575
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:32,558
hard fork versus a soft fork a hard fork

1576
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:35,440
is

1577
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:37,119
when it's not no longer compatible

1578
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,480
what's the right way to put it

1579
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:40,480
they can't operate on the same

1580
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,280
blockchain they say with the same

1581
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:43,440
protocol

1582
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,720
yeah so there's a few ways to define

1583
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,519
them and it's

1584
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,000
pretty it gets controversial as well but

1585
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:50,880
um

1586
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,440
one one way to define it as a hard fork

1587
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,640
is

1588
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:57,200
a expansion of protocol rules and a soft

1589
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:58,480
fork as a shrinking of protocol rules

1590
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,318
that's an interesting way to find it

1591
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,039
it's not very intuitive so i don't like

1592
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:04,159
that way

1593
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:06,000
um another way is that a hard fork is

1594
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:07,199
backwards and compatible whereas

1595
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:10,480
softwork is

1596
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:13,679
in theory backwards compatible so in

1597
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,719
august 2017 basically the large blockers

1598
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:17,279
had had enough

1599
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:18,239
and they said we're going to hard fork

1600
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:21,119
bitcoin we're going to

1601
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,239
create a clone an alternative version of

1602
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,280
bitcoin

1603
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:28,159
which has the same a shared history

1604
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,800
as bitcoin itself but you completely

1605
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:33,118
fork it and you create a new future

1606
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:34,880
and uh but you know everybody that had a

1607
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,119
balance on bitcoin at the time

1608
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,039
also had a balance on the alternative

1609
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,720
coin bitcoin cash

1610
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:42,960
and so that was really that's what it's

1611
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:44,558
called bitcoin cash is the hard fork

1612
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,000
that was one of them there were more

1613
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,559
actually i mean what what the heck

1614
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,280
is bitcoin satoshi uh satoshi's vision

1615
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:51,760
bsv

1616
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,280
bitcoin sv so this is all talking about

1617
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,119
increasing the max

1618
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:57,599
the limit of the block size more and

1619
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,440
more and more yeah that was one of the

1620
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:00,880
changes they wanted to push through uh

1621
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,159
but bsv was the fork

1622
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:06,880
of bitcoin cash so hard fork of bitcoin

1623
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:07,598
yeah so and so now there's multiple big

1624
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,200
blocker

1625
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:10,640
block chains floating around it's like

1626
00:55:09,199 --> 00:55:13,118
what are your thoughts about them

1627
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:14,159
well i was pretty popular sorry to

1628
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,760
interrupt

1629
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,279
uh are they popular i mean if you look

1630
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:20,079
at the metrics they're not and

1631
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,760
oh they they don't trade they i think

1632
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,359
each trade below one percent of the

1633
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,119
value of bitcoin itself i see so

1634
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:26,558
measuring popularity is like how much

1635
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,119
they actually oh

1636
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,240
value uh value frequency of trade oh no

1637
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,599
no i mean

1638
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:33,279
they they do like a fair number of

1639
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,359
transactions but there's an there's no

1640
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,480
way to know that that is genuine

1641
00:55:35,358 --> 00:55:40,239
or just contrived so you know ultimately

1642
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:41,039
the true measure i think in my mind is

1643
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,919
just

1644
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:45,759
where the market prices these protocols

1645
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,200
relative to bitcoin

1646
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,799
uh because that's like a prediction

1647
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:51,439
market if

1648
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:53,280
if bitcoin cash was being priced at 50

1649
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:56,318
of bitcoin you could say

1650
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,440
the market has given it a 50 chance of

1651
00:55:56,318 --> 00:56:00,480
unseating bitcoin

1652
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,119
right but both bitcoin cash and bitcoin

1653
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:04,559
sv which was a hard fork from bitcoin

1654
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,559
cash itself

1655
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,839
are well i believe at this point well

1656
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,798
below one percent of the value of

1657
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:11,519
bitcoin

1658
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:12,798
and in the so in like the ranking of

1659
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,280
different cryptocurrencies

1660
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:16,159
what is it bitcoin ethereum is ethereum

1661
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,960
in value

1662
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:19,679
uh yeah number two and then bitcoin cash

1663
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,519
is the one that

1664
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,960
it's in the top five right but it's just

1665
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:24,559
a fast drop off

1666
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,480
you know i haven't checked lately but i

1667
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,359
think it's it's reached kind of

1668
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,760
morbidity

1669
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:30,880
you know it doesn't really have much

1670
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,040
traction

1671
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,318
um the blocks aren't full so the whole

1672
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:36,079
value proposition was

1673
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:38,318
you know we will get all this merchant

1674
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,240
adoption if we increase the block size

1675
00:56:38,318 --> 00:56:42,880
that just didn't materialize

1676
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,159
in my view they had a flawed vision of

1677
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,760
how adoption works

1678
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:50,000
and what blockchain should optimize for

1679
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,359
uh maybe maybe you get a bitcoin cash

1680
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,798
supporter on the show they'll give you a

1681
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:54,159
different answer

1682
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:56,000
but yeah full disclosure you know i have

1683
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:58,159
my sympathies and

1684
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,079
i think the small blockers won that

1685
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:00,798
skirmish for sure so at this time

1686
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,559
there's no

1687
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:04,559
merchant adoption and so on so it's kind

1688
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:06,720
of its vision the whole

1689
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,640
reason for existence for at least for

1690
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:11,679
now hasn't materialized

1691
00:57:08,639 --> 00:57:12,480
and so that's that's the indication it's

1692
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:16,000
possible that

1693
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,639
well it's a sign that perhaps that's the

1694
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:20,960
wrong way to accomplish the scalability

1695
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:23,279
well you know first of all i think the

1696
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,798
layered scaling model is definitely

1697
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,400
definitely correct i mean that's

1698
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:26,880
absolutely the way these things have to

1699
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:29,039
work

1700
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,318
given the constraints of blockchains

1701
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,558
what is the layered

1702
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:34,079
scaling model it's really how all

1703
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,480
payment systems scale

1704
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,318
blockchain or otherwise and i think a

1705
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,440
lot of people don't understand this

1706
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,880
is that there is no equivalent to

1707
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:44,960
scaling at the base layer

1708
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,720
in the regular payment space that

1709
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,720
totally doesn't happen

1710
00:57:46,719 --> 00:57:50,399
all of them are built on layers so visa

1711
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:52,239
is like the fifth layer

1712
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,559
in the payment stack that ultimately

1713
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:56,959
depends on these utility scale

1714
00:57:54,559 --> 00:58:00,160
settlement systems like fedwire

1715
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,199
chips ach basically interbank settlement

1716
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:04,318
systems

1717
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:05,519
so you've got these slow moving but high

1718
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:08,558
assurance

1719
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:09,440
settlement systems fedwire is probably

1720
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:10,798
the number one

1721
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,760
you know like when you send a wire

1722
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:16,480
that's using the fedwar system typically

1723
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,559
on top of that you know you have banks

1724
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,000
and then you have payment processors

1725
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:21,200
and then you build up these layers and

1726
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,119
layers and layers and then you have

1727
00:58:21,199 --> 00:58:26,399
these fast payments you know

1728
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:29,280
venmo paypal credit debit visa

1729
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,160
you name it those payments are not final

1730
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,400
when they occur

1731
00:58:30,159 --> 00:58:33,920
you know a credit card transaction will

1732
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:37,200
not be final for

1733
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:39,440
90 to 120 days so

1734
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:41,199
that's fascinating you've decoupled the

1735
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,798
payment the financial message

1736
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:44,719
and the settlement those are distinct

1737
00:58:42,798 --> 00:58:46,239
concepts and the settlement happens on a

1738
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:49,118
deferred basis

1739
00:58:46,239 --> 00:58:50,239
so that's how you get scalability is you

1740
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:53,680
have lots and lots of

1741
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:54,798
messages but that they don't settle for

1742
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:56,719
a long time

1743
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:58,719
they might settle on a net basis on an

1744
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:00,879
end-of-day basis

1745
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,159
but so that's really how it works and

1746
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,680
then you have fed wire where your

1747
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,798
average transactions in the millions of

1748
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:06,318
dollars

1749
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:07,838
and there's only a few hundred thousand

1750
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:08,719
transactions a day it's sort of an

1751
00:59:07,838 --> 00:59:11,759
interbank

1752
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:14,159
settlement network so that's my

1753
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,799
vision for how i think bitcoin will

1754
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,838
develop

1755
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:18,079
too bitcoin itself on the base layer is

1756
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:20,078
the

1757
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:21,280
slow moving high assurance final

1758
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,480
settlement network where if you're

1759
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,280
sending money to the other side of the

1760
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,440
globe

1761
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,440
to someone you don't trust where you

1762
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,760
want that payment to be final

1763
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,599
in a short period of time and both

1764
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:33,359
counterparties know it's final

1765
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,960
then you would use that but if you

1766
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:35,920
wanted to buy coffee you could do it on

1767
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,480
a second

1768
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,280
you know second layer uh lightning would

1769
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,760
be one way

1770
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,319
there's a bunch of side chains now or

1771
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,200
you could

1772
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,159
use you know a more centralized solution

1773
00:59:45,199 --> 00:59:49,199
if you wanted

1774
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:50,798
it's kind of a profound idea that in the

1775
00:59:49,199 --> 00:59:52,480
space of transactions when you're buying

1776
00:59:50,798 --> 00:59:54,880
coffee or buying anything really from

1777
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,880
merchant or exchanging goods and all

1778
00:59:54,880 --> 01:00:01,358
those kinds of things

1779
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:04,720
that most of the time like basic

1780
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:06,480
honest behavior human behavior which

1781
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:08,159
it does appear that most of our

1782
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:09,280
societies is based on the fact that

1783
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:12,480
we're all

1784
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:14,000
most of us are honest is

1785
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,679
like stuff is not going to go wrong when

1786
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:18,559
you do the transaction

1787
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:20,000
and you only need like the base layer

1788
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:22,319
well there's bitcoin whether it's

1789
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:24,000
uh i forget the terms you use for the

1790
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:28,480
for the credit card version

1791
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:31,920
but you need that just to verify

1792
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,679
just to like resolve any disagreements

1793
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,000
or shady

1794
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:36,960
yeah and and that's a really rare

1795
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,480
occurrence

1796
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:43,679
so it's okay for that to be handled uh

1797
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:45,920
in this in the small block debate uh

1798
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:48,239
handled at a rate that's much much lower

1799
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,400
than the rate of the transactions

1800
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,959
that's kind of it's a really interesting

1801
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:56,079
idea that when we spend money

1802
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:57,838
we didn't actually exchange the money

1803
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,519
most of the time yeah most of the time

1804
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:01,358
you're not getting final settlement when

1805
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:04,639
you do a transaction

1806
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:06,719
and oftentimes that causes there

1807
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:08,558
are there's pluses and minuses on the

1808
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:10,639
plus side you have huge efficiency

1809
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,400
if you use a credit network like visa

1810
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:14,879
but that it's in the name credit

1811
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:16,079
right visa is extending you credit right

1812
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,920
they're kind of guaranteeing your

1813
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,599
reputation to the merchant

1814
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,440
but fraud happens all the time right

1815
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:24,240
there's always fraud

1816
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,039
because you have this reversibility

1817
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:27,598
right

1818
01:01:25,039 --> 01:01:29,358
um and so you can you know engage in

1819
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:32,400
fraud against a merchant

1820
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:34,318
um if you have a final settlement

1821
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,240
there's no possibility for fraud so

1822
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:37,759
that's one reason merchants kind of like

1823
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:40,399
accepting bitcoin because

1824
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,440
once you receive an inbound bitcoin

1825
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,639
payment and you

1826
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,720
deliver some good or service you know

1827
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:49,598
that payment can't be reversed

1828
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:52,159
but frankly most of the transactions we

1829
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:54,400
you know undertake on a daily basis

1830
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:55,920
do not require those strong assurances

1831
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:57,599
of final settlement

1832
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,838
there's one exception which is physical

1833
01:01:57,599 --> 01:02:02,960
cash with physical cash

1834
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:04,400
or the open dime a cash-like product

1835
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,318
you actually are getting final

1836
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:09,599
settlement but

1837
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:11,838
online most online banking transactions

1838
01:02:09,599 --> 01:02:14,798
most p2p

1839
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:15,599
digital wallet transactions in the

1840
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:18,559
dollar system

1841
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:19,760
they're not really final at all you

1842
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,640
mentioned lightning

1843
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:23,200
lightning network what is it what are

1844
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:25,519
your thoughts

1845
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:27,358
on it and what are your thoughts about

1846
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:30,960
any kind of alternatives

1847
01:02:27,358 --> 01:02:34,078
so lightning is one potential

1848
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:36,240
payment solution built on top of bitcoin

1849
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,480
where you have different assurances

1850
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:40,239
different transactional assurances

1851
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,079
but ultimately it's very proximate to

1852
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:43,838
the base layer so if something goes

1853
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,440
wrong you can always basically settle to

1854
01:02:43,838 --> 01:02:48,960
the base layer this layer two

1855
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:50,880
yeah layer two you could say and

1856
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,318
basically the intuition is kind of like

1857
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,400
opening a bar tab

1858
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:56,079
so you go to the bar and you might drink

1859
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,880
a dozen beers over the course of the

1860
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:00,079
night

1861
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,838
maybe half a dozen um

1862
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:03,280
and well i guess nobody goes to the bar

1863
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:06,719
these days but

1864
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:08,240
let's say you did yeah you open a tab

1865
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,239
and at the end of the night you settle

1866
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:12,798
up once you're not

1867
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:14,078
necessarily paying each time you get

1868
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:15,519
another beer

1869
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,200
so it's it's the same idea you're

1870
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:19,440
opening a channel an ongoing

1871
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:22,078
relationship with your counterparty

1872
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,838
and so lightning has you open a channel

1873
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,880
the counterparty and you're sort of

1874
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:26,880
sending back and forth these

1875
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,880
cryptographic commitments saying you

1876
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,559
know i agree to send you some bitcoin

1877
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:32,160
but you don't necessarily settle each

1878
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,200
time you make a transaction so you do

1879
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:36,000
hundreds of thousands

1880
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:38,000
of transactions in a channel the other

1881
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:38,719
thing lightning proposes is saying okay

1882
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,440
well

1883
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:43,199
now that we have channels established

1884
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,079
what if we interlocked a number of

1885
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:46,399
channels together

1886
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,920
so if you and i have a channel and you

1887
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,639
know me and my buddy have a channel

1888
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:52,639
my buddy can now pay you because you're

1889
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:54,879
you have a relationship through me

1890
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,719
basically and so lightning is this

1891
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,480
network this overlay network that sits

1892
01:03:56,719 --> 01:04:01,038
on top of bitcoin

1893
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:03,519
and allows people to transact in a much

1894
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:05,520
faster and less frictional way

1895
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:08,079
without the need for bitcoin's kind of

1896
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:10,838
slow periodic settlement

1897
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:12,240
um assuming that everything sort of goes

1898
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:14,078
well uh

1899
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:16,000
do you see any downsides to this like

1900
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:17,839
have you seen flaws in the whole system

1901
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,838
from a security perspective from a

1902
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,679
scaling perspective

1903
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:23,038
any of that or is it is lightning

1904
01:04:21,679 --> 01:04:25,919
working well

1905
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,559
it works i've i use it um when i

1906
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,559
initially

1907
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,000
sold those dice i sold them on lightning

1908
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,079
i was one of the first

1909
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,358
merchants to use lightning back in the

1910
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:37,519
day uh the first edition of the dice

1911
01:04:35,358 --> 01:04:39,038
so people could buy these guys somewhere

1912
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,000
well they used to be able to i haven't

1913
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,559
made a new addition

1914
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:43,119
recently they're very scarce and very

1915
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,880
special

1916
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:48,880
they're like physical nfts just kind of

1917
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,240
yeah i mean the flaw with lightning is

1918
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:51,680
really that you

1919
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:53,038
you know and this can be remediated a

1920
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:55,199
number of ways but you have to sort of

1921
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,200
pre-fund these channels so it's

1922
01:04:55,199 --> 01:04:58,639
it's a weird concept to have to inject

1923
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:02,159
liquidity into a channel

1924
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:04,480
in order to accept a payment you know so

1925
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,920
i'm sure those user experience problems

1926
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:08,798
can be solved

1927
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,000
but it's still uh in a state of relative

1928
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:13,358
immaturity

1929
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:14,318
so we'll see in terms of other ideas

1930
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:17,440
that are

1931
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:18,960
side chains or soft forks of bitcoin

1932
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,358
you've mentioned something about schnoor

1933
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,880
and taproot

1934
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:25,119
what are your thoughts about this update

1935
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,838
to bitcoin

1936
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:29,119
and in terms of its promise to improve

1937
01:05:27,838 --> 01:05:31,358
privacy and scaling

1938
01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:33,680
and so on and what what other things are

1939
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:35,598
you interested excited about in terms of

1940
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,919
the development of bitcoin

1941
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:39,920
well schnorr and toproot that's the

1942
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:45,200
first new protocol upgrade

1943
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:46,720
since segwit in 2017 which was what

1944
01:05:45,199 --> 01:05:48,480
laid the groundwork for lightning to be

1945
01:05:46,719 --> 01:05:51,279
developed basically

1946
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,079
and fruit is really the first protocol

1947
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:55,119
change

1948
01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:58,400
in three almost four years now

1949
01:05:55,119 --> 01:06:01,200
so it's we're very excited about it

1950
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:02,480
what uh what are i mean is there any

1951
01:06:01,199 --> 01:06:04,239
something interesting to say

1952
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,318
technically about what are the things

1953
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:10,479
that's actually going to improve

1954
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:13,759
and um maybe on a on the politics side

1955
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:16,000
bringing a protocol change

1956
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,160
uh on bitcoin what does that actually

1957
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,000
involve yeah i mean it's a huge deal

1958
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:21,358
because the last time we tried to make a

1959
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,719
change to the protocol we had whole

1960
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:25,519
civil war over it

1961
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:28,318
and it was incredibly difficult to get

1962
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:30,559
segwit activated in 2017

1963
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:32,960
uh and it took all this bricksmanship

1964
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,760
and threats and all these campaigns

1965
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,079
and it was this whole thing luckily i

1966
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,440
think

1967
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:39,280
things have quieted down and there's

1968
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,240
much more consensus that schnorr top

1969
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,079
rate is a good

1970
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:43,279
change to bitcoin and everyone generally

1971
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,680
supports it

1972
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,720
but everyone kind of has ptsd over the

1973
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:48,960
last time

1974
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:50,798
when we tried to change bitcoin and so

1975
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:52,639
we're sort of really dithering over how

1976
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,719
we actually want to implement it

1977
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:56,318
so it's taking forever because we're

1978
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:58,959
trying to set the protocol

1979
01:06:56,318 --> 01:06:59,358
for how do you change bitcoin itself and

1980
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,559
that

1981
01:06:59,358 --> 01:07:02,558
all of our assumptions went out the

1982
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,079
window last time so we're trying to

1983
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:06,079
reset and decide

1984
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,839
what is a legitimate way to institute a

1985
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,280
change to bitcoin

1986
01:07:07,838 --> 01:07:11,199
so that's actually the big question

1987
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,880
right now it's not should we implement

1988
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:15,439
these changes we basically all agree

1989
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,119
that we should it's a meta question is

1990
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:18,720
what's the valid way to implement new

1991
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,960
changes to bitcoin

1992
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:22,719
what's a way that is scalable in the

1993
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:24,240
long term and will last and people

1994
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,000
consider credible

1995
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:27,679
even if this one isn't controversial at

1996
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,920
all so that's

1997
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:31,598
where we're at we're basically debating

1998
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,280
over how do we implement this change

1999
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,760
that we all want

2000
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,319
if to get a feeling of how slow bitcoin

2001
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,640
governance is and how deliberate it is

2002
01:07:38,318 --> 01:07:42,558
everybody collectively wants the change

2003
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:44,400
but we haven't fully agreed on how we're

2004
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,079
going to put it into bitcoin

2005
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,440
so it's a classic sort of bitcoin

2006
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:49,599
situation

2007
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,440
but what it is is i mean schnorr is an

2008
01:07:49,599 --> 01:07:53,680
alternative signature scheme i think it

2009
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:57,119
was encumbered by a patent

2010
01:07:53,679 --> 01:07:59,838
and it only just been unencumbered when

2011
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:01,358
satoshi created bitcoin i believe

2012
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:03,358
it's a better signature scheme than

2013
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:05,759
elliptic curves which is what

2014
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:07,038
uh big than ecdsa which is what bitcoin

2015
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,920
uses

2016
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,960
and uh so it's been long enough that we

2017
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,720
now trust it

2018
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,960
you know kind of in cryptography it's

2019
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:17,679
meant to be lindy you know it's sort of

2020
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:20,319
you want to test it over time and then

2021
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:22,239
it's considered safe to use so schnorr

2022
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,480
has been around for long enough that

2023
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:26,158
we've decided to rip out ecdsa

2024
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:27,678
and insert snore which is just a

2025
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,798
different signature scheme which is more

2026
01:08:27,679 --> 01:08:31,119
efficient

2027
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:32,479
um and it has better properties like if

2028
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:33,679
you want to do a multi-signature

2029
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:36,798
transaction where

2030
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:38,640
many people collectively sign in order

2031
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:41,359
permission a spend

2032
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:42,159
that would be more efficient in a bytes

2033
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,279
sense

2034
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:46,719
than uh ecdsa for instance so it's

2035
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:50,159
pretty incremental

2036
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,158
and then toproot is all about

2037
01:08:50,838 --> 01:08:55,920
having transactional conditions

2038
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:57,920
that are sort of withheld from final

2039
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:01,838
entry onto the blockchain

2040
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:04,960
um so it it's kind of a way to

2041
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:07,519
um have more private conditional

2042
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,119
transactions on bitcoin

2043
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:10,719
so both of them i would say are

2044
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:13,759
incremental uh

2045
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:15,439
changes is this an over-exaggeration

2046
01:09:13,759 --> 01:09:16,880
that channels approve might improve

2047
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:18,399
privacy and scaling

2048
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,920
which is it like at the high level

2049
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:22,798
things that people mention

2050
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,759
is that just like a dramatic way of of

2051
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:26,479
trying to frame

2052
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,359
uh what's fundamentally an incremental

2053
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,358
improvement

2054
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,719
yes but incremental is the word right

2055
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,400
it's not we're not going to get an order

2056
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,000
of magnitude enhancement to either

2057
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:37,439
privacy or scaling but we

2058
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:39,039
will get a considerable enhancement

2059
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:40,960
but privacy and scaling are actually two

2060
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:42,798
sides the same coin because

2061
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:45,359
you get more transactional privacy by

2062
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:47,119
removing data from the ledger

2063
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,960
so that there's less metadata for people

2064
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:52,399
to surveil and analyze

2065
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:55,039
and that's also you scale by compressing

2066
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,920
and being really space efficient with

2067
01:09:55,039 --> 01:09:58,560
transactions

2068
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:00,000
and the more parsimonious you are the

2069
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:01,920
more economically

2070
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,760
dense each bite that everyone has to

2071
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,719
retain on the ledger is

2072
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:09,199
and so those are you know very closely

2073
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:11,920
allied concepts

2074
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:14,079
so do you mind if we go through some

2075
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,359
potential criticisms

2076
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:18,880
of bitcoin totally yeah i've spent the

2077
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:21,679
last five years

2078
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,000
you know tackling these every day so are

2079
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,560
the

2080
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,279
the dice the same uh those two are the

2081
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,200
same yeah

2082
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:28,800
there are three editions so let's go

2083
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:31,198
[Applause]

2084
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:32,159
okay go with the dice what do we got oh

2085
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:35,119
silk road

2086
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:35,839
what does that mean road classic classic

2087
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:38,000
situation

2088
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:40,640
so i mean that was the darknet

2089
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:42,560
marketplace set up by ross albrecht

2090
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,360
in the early days of bitcoin that's one

2091
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,920
of the first killer apps for bitcoin was

2092
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:48,399
being

2093
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,840
the payments network behind this darknet

2094
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:51,839
marketplace

2095
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,279
and uh you know where you'd go to buy

2096
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,119
drugs and things

2097
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:56,559
and so that became associated with

2098
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:58,479
bitcoin if you remember the press

2099
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,400
coverage from back then

2100
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:01,839
but over time that faded and it became

2101
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:04,158
less of a critique but

2102
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,440
so like the the critique is that uh

2103
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:08,479
bitcoin is something you

2104
01:11:05,439 --> 01:11:10,479
would use for illegal activity for drugs

2105
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:12,479
for crimes all those kinds of things

2106
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:14,158
as opposed to for any kind of legitimate

2107
01:11:12,479 --> 01:11:16,079
transactions yeah

2108
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:18,559
in the merchant transactions and today

2109
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,800
bitcoin settles 10 billion dollars a day

2110
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:22,560
and the vast vast majority of it is you

2111
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,279
know completely legitimate it's just a

2112
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,560
useful

2113
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:28,399
alternative system but back then a huge

2114
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,159
fraction of all bitcoin transactions

2115
01:11:28,399 --> 01:11:32,479
were related to the

2116
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:33,519
basically illicit marketplaces and if

2117
01:11:32,479 --> 01:11:36,959
you're just tuning in

2118
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:40,640
this incredible 12-sided die has 11

2119
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:43,920
common criticisms of bitcoin that nick

2120
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:47,039
yeah in in a genius way has put together

2121
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,039
maybe we could do a couple more

2122
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:53,119
oh said that it was satoshi something

2123
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:55,840
satoshi coins satoshi coins we we

2124
01:11:53,119 --> 01:11:58,880
touched on that early in the episode

2125
01:11:55,840 --> 01:12:01,920
what if satoshi returns and sells

2126
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:03,840
all of their coins so we don't know for

2127
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:06,239
sure how many coins satoshi actually

2128
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:08,880
mined or produced because there's a

2129
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:12,238
degree of probabilistic analysis

2130
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:15,679
that you would do there's a few

2131
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:17,759
few thousand blocks that were mined by

2132
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,119
what we think is a single entity in sort

2133
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:20,880
of 2009

2134
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:22,399
and so if you add them all up you get to

2135
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:23,440
about a million so people think that

2136
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:25,039
satoshi

2137
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:27,678
mined a million coins and then they're

2138
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:30,479
worried that satoshi would return and

2139
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:33,520
market sell all the coins

2140
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:36,879
thus crushing the price of bitcoin

2141
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:40,400
so looking at some of these uh

2142
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:41,920
no ceo i think we touch we've already

2143
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:44,960
hit on

2144
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:48,480
the dice no merchants that that's

2145
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,480
no longer true about that yeah

2146
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:53,519
there's a scalability one and i think

2147
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,960
that one has addressed

2148
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,800
the idea that you're mentioning with the

2149
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:58,239
block size debates and the lightning

2150
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,400
network that

2151
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:02,319
by adding extra layers on top you can

2152
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:06,238
you can achieve scalability

2153
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:07,759
that's my vision that's my theory um

2154
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:09,599
and you know you can do it in a

2155
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,640
permissionless and a permissioned way

2156
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,880
like coinbase

2157
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,920
is a big bitcoin exchange they provide

2158
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,319
scalability

2159
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:17,279
they're a financial institution you know

2160
01:13:16,319 --> 01:13:19,519
you can settle up

2161
01:13:17,279 --> 01:13:21,039
internally on their own database and

2162
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,159
then you know periodically settle to

2163
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:24,479
bitcoin so

2164
01:13:22,158 --> 01:13:26,479
oh so they don't uh they do something

2165
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:27,839
like the lighting network internally so

2166
01:13:26,479 --> 01:13:29,759
something like this the middle kind of

2167
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,199
mechanism well honestly i'm not sure

2168
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,600
exactly how it works they might have

2169
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:34,079
that

2170
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,360
built in but just generally speaking

2171
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:38,479
institutional scaling

2172
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:39,039
is a model for scaling right where you

2173
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:40,879
could have

2174
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:43,039
banks holding bitcoin and they issue

2175
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:45,039
notes against bitcoin and

2176
01:13:43,039 --> 01:13:46,719
those are your payments and then the

2177
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:49,119
base layers the settlement

2178
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,560
layer i think that's what you're getting

2179
01:13:49,119 --> 01:13:53,198
with the

2180
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:53,840
boiling oceans is this is like the

2181
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:57,198
impact

2182
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:58,840
on uh weather and the environment and

2183
01:13:57,198 --> 01:14:02,238
the environment

2184
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,000
so uh you know that is a concern that

2185
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:05,519
people have in terms of like the proof

2186
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:07,439
of work requires that there's

2187
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:08,800
a lot of computational resources and uh

2188
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:11,678
being used and that

2189
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,360
requires a lot of energy and like some

2190
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:14,319
large percentage of the world's energy

2191
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:17,439
is used to

2192
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:18,799
to mine bitcoin what's how how would you

2193
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:20,158
respond to that criticism

2194
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,000
yeah i mean that's been the loudest

2195
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:24,238
critique of bitcoin this year

2196
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,920
in the press this year really yeah so i

2197
01:14:24,238 --> 01:14:28,158
mean it's not like a new

2198
01:14:25,920 --> 01:14:29,359
criticism but bitcoin is consuming more

2199
01:14:28,158 --> 01:14:32,799
energy than ever

2200
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:35,519
so as the price rises the electricity

2201
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:38,880
consumption rises and so

2202
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:41,040
we've we've heard renewed uh

2203
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,319
you know bellyaching over this for sure

2204
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:44,158
i mean it's

2205
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:45,840
if you don't believe that bitcoin is

2206
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:47,599
useful then you're inclined to think

2207
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:48,800
that all the energy consumption is a

2208
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:51,920
waste

2209
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:53,760
so that's you know it's it's it's

2210
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:56,640
something that's sort of unrebuttable

2211
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:58,560
if you fundamentally contest the

2212
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:02,239
validity of the bitcoin system

2213
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:05,280
so if bitcoin is like a thing

2214
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:06,319
that will take over it will become like

2215
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:09,679
the main

2216
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:12,399
mechanism of financial transactions

2217
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:14,399
or transactions period in the world then

2218
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:15,839
you say well the cost of energy use is

2219
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:17,039
actually quite low relative to the

2220
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,440
benefit it provides

2221
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:20,479
if you think it's not going to be if

2222
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:23,759
it's just a

2223
01:15:20,479 --> 01:15:25,439
volatile uh way to

2224
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,760
uh to make a little money in the short

2225
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:29,839
term then you see the energy used as

2226
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,280
really wasteful that's totally spurious

2227
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,679
yeah yeah so

2228
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:34,880
so then there's no really response i

2229
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,359
suppose

2230
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:39,440
that's so i can totally you know get

2231
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:40,639
into the details of bitcoin synergy mix

2232
01:15:39,439 --> 01:15:42,158
and things like that but

2233
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,480
that's like at a high level what the

2234
01:15:42,158 --> 01:15:46,799
debate is it's this normative question

2235
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:49,119
like does bitcoin have an entitlement to

2236
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,719
consume any of the world's resources

2237
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:53,279
and that's actually where the debate

2238
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:55,760
should end much of the time

2239
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:56,559
because a lot of people fundamentally

2240
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,640
dispute

2241
01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:00,080
the the validity or usefulness of

2242
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:02,480
bitcoin as a system

2243
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:05,119
and so of course they're gonna consider

2244
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:07,039
the energy usage illegitimate

2245
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:09,679
now there's a lot of mitigating factors

2246
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:12,238
if you you know think the bitcoin is a

2247
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:13,359
potentially useful system which is

2248
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:16,079
bitcoin

2249
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:17,198
consumes energy in a very peculiar way

2250
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:20,158
which virtually no

2251
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:20,879
other industry does which is that

2252
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:24,238
bitcoin

2253
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,199
is a geography independent buyer of

2254
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,399
energy

2255
01:16:25,198 --> 01:16:30,079
which is not how we humans

2256
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:32,399
typically consume energy like we need

2257
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,359
energy to be produced near to population

2258
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:36,079
centers

2259
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:37,920
and we need it to be produced at the you

2260
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:39,600
know corresponding to the peaks and

2261
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,920
troughs of our consumption

2262
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:44,000
right because we have to 100 match the

2263
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:47,920
demand and the supply at all times

2264
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,600
right otherwise we have blackouts so

2265
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:52,640
bitcoin doesn't care

2266
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:54,239
about any of that it just buys energy on

2267
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,159
a constant basis

2268
01:16:54,238 --> 01:16:57,599
and so it's you know indifferent to

2269
01:16:56,158 --> 01:17:00,319
where it's being produced

2270
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:01,199
and so the the consequence of all that

2271
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:03,759
is that

2272
01:17:01,198 --> 01:17:04,719
bitcoin will buy energy that's otherwise

2273
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,360
being wasted

2274
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,079
basically so it will buy so-called

2275
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:10,399
stranded

2276
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:12,640
energy assets that would not make it to

2277
01:17:10,399 --> 01:17:16,719
a population center and in fact most

2278
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:17,600
energy produced is ultimately does not

2279
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:20,480
sort of make it

2280
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:21,440
to you know your your socket in your

2281
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:24,238
wall

2282
01:17:21,439 --> 01:17:25,919
um and so this is why so much bitcoin is

2283
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:27,919
mine in china for instance

2284
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:29,679
it's not because you know chinese

2285
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:30,800
industrialists had a special affinity

2286
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,359
for bitcoin

2287
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,880
it's because the chinese grid had a

2288
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:37,039
massive overabundance

2289
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:39,119
of energy in particularly in four

2290
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:42,158
provinces sichuan yunnan

2291
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:44,479
inner mongolia and zhang jing so in

2292
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:46,238
those four provinces those are all

2293
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:47,759
pretty distant from major population

2294
01:17:46,238 --> 01:17:49,839
centers

2295
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:52,079
so because of that you can't really

2296
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:54,640
transport the energy that easily and so

2297
01:17:52,079 --> 01:17:57,039
huge amounts of energy are curtailed or

2298
01:17:54,640 --> 01:17:59,760
basically wasted in all these provinces

2299
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,600
and so miners set up shop there because

2300
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,119
they could mine bitcoin with the excess

2301
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:05,440
energy they could monetize this thing

2302
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:07,279
that otherwise was going to go to waste

2303
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:09,119
so you know there's things like that

2304
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:11,679
which you know

2305
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:12,319
i think mitigate the the reality bitcoin

2306
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:15,600
is not really

2307
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:17,840
rival um with our consumption of

2308
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:19,520
electricity it's not depriving anyone of

2309
01:18:17,840 --> 01:18:22,000
electricity it's mostly

2310
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:24,400
these stranded assets that are going

2311
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:27,119
into supporting the bitcoin network

2312
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:29,359
so maybe let's do a last one since you

2313
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:32,559
mentioned china says china control

2314
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:35,599
so so much mining is happening in china

2315
01:18:32,560 --> 01:18:38,880
how do we not uh how do we prevent

2316
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:41,520
nation states from controlling much of

2317
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,000
bitcoin yeah that's the flip side of a

2318
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,600
large

2319
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:45,600
portion of the blocks being mined in

2320
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,480
china due to this energy feature which i

2321
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,800
discussed

2322
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:50,399
which is that there's a lot of chinese

2323
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:53,600
miners for sure

2324
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:55,759
now the question ultimately is what

2325
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:56,800
degree of control do miners have over

2326
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,600
the bitcoin system

2327
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,239
right and that was part of the block

2328
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,920
size

2329
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:05,599
debate i mean the miners when we

2330
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:07,199
implemented sub-graded witness in in

2331
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:09,440
2017 the miners just

2332
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:12,238
didn't want to do it eventually the

2333
01:19:09,439 --> 01:19:15,359
users the regular folks running nodes

2334
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:16,639
rebelled and basically said look we're

2335
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:17,679
going to implement this whether or not

2336
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:19,520
you do it

2337
01:19:17,679 --> 01:19:20,960
and it was a threat to the value of

2338
01:19:19,520 --> 01:19:22,239
bitcoin because if

2339
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,760
this threat had gone through it could

2340
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:24,959
have split bitcoin and it had been

2341
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,159
really messy

2342
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:30,560
so the miners sort of capitulated so

2343
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:32,719
i think the current consensus is that

2344
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:34,480
miners do not have unilateral control

2345
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:36,158
over bitcoin

2346
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:37,839
and the governance is more poised

2347
01:19:36,158 --> 01:19:39,679
between people that run nodes

2348
01:19:37,840 --> 01:19:41,039
developers and miners it's sort of a

2349
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,440
triumvirate

2350
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:44,719
where neither of them has you know total

2351
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:46,639
control

2352
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:48,640
uh so that's my current model for

2353
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,280
controlling bitcoin

2354
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:53,039
i think if you asked a minor they would

2355
01:19:51,279 --> 01:19:54,960
tell you they didn't feel that they had

2356
01:19:53,039 --> 01:19:56,640
sort of unilateral control over bitcoin

2357
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,560
either

2358
01:19:56,640 --> 01:20:00,880
almost as a thought experiment can i ask

2359
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:03,360
you to think about

2360
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:04,640
if you're if some of your predictions

2361
01:20:03,359 --> 01:20:06,479
some of your analysis

2362
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,079
some of your understanding of bitcoin is

2363
01:20:06,479 --> 01:20:10,559
wrong

2364
01:20:08,079 --> 01:20:12,079
in in the following sense where it will

2365
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,199
not have the impact

2366
01:20:12,079 --> 01:20:18,000
uh that you have a

2367
01:20:15,198 --> 01:20:19,839
vision for it that you will not have the

2368
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:21,920
scale of impact and perhaps in terms of

2369
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:23,840
value will go to zero to something very

2370
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:25,119
low and other cryptocurrency or other

2371
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:28,239
financial systems will

2372
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:31,039
overtake it what would be the reason

2373
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:32,000
for that in your mind like why might you

2374
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:34,719
be

2375
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,158
wrong if you look back at it yeah in the

2376
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:37,760
future

2377
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:39,599
what did you not understand about

2378
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:42,480
bitcoin that uh

2379
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:43,600
will result in that yeah that's a great

2380
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:46,799
question

2381
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:47,840
i think for that to happen one of two

2382
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,520
things would have to

2383
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,440
obtain one of two things would have to

2384
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:54,480
happen for bitcoin to just

2385
01:20:51,439 --> 01:20:56,559
be irrelevant basically um

2386
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:58,238
either central banks totally clean up

2387
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:00,400
their act and uh

2388
01:20:58,238 --> 01:21:01,519
you know stop engaging in rampant money

2389
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:02,960
printing

2390
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:05,040
which i don't expect that to happen

2391
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:08,239
anytime soon i mean it looks like we're

2392
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:10,079
normalizing this new regime of inflation

2393
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:12,799
you know pro-inflation just to remediate

2394
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:14,800
the debt issues we have

2395
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:16,400
uh so that would be one thing that would

2396
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:19,119
make bitcoin

2397
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:20,879
cryptocurrency much less relevant as if

2398
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:22,000
everyone becomes totally assured of the

2399
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,600
soundness

2400
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:27,198
of sovereign currencies basically

2401
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,520
namely the dollar like the dollar being

2402
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:31,039
the main one uh

2403
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:32,719
that it seems like we're going

2404
01:21:31,039 --> 01:21:35,279
completely opposite direction

2405
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:37,600
but most people seem to be noticing the

2406
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:39,519
stirrings of inflation in society

2407
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,440
and you might have noticed it too it's

2408
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,560
showing up in commodity prices lumber

2409
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:44,559
prices

2410
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:45,600
and food obviously in financial assets

2411
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,280
and

2412
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:49,120
it'll show up in consumer prices

2413
01:21:47,279 --> 01:21:50,960
generally soon

2414
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:53,359
but so that would be one way for bitcoin

2415
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:54,800
to basically become irrelevant

2416
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:56,399
because it's a you know it's a

2417
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:59,840
dialectical thing

2418
01:21:56,399 --> 01:22:02,879
bitcoin is held in opposition to

2419
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:03,199
the established monetary regime so if

2420
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:05,760
they

2421
01:22:03,198 --> 01:22:07,359
completely reform themselves and you

2422
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,719
know the dollar becomes

2423
01:22:07,359 --> 01:22:11,519
super sound once again and the fed stops

2424
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:15,359
tinkering

2425
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:17,199
the way they constantly do then uh

2426
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:20,000
then we wouldn't need cryptocurrency as

2427
01:22:17,198 --> 01:22:23,119
much the other thing would be if

2428
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:26,639
a completely superior design

2429
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:28,479
for a new sort of state independent

2430
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:30,880
monetary system emerged

2431
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:32,638
but it's really hard to even imagine how

2432
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:35,600
that would come to emerge

2433
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:37,359
and there's good reasons to think that

2434
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,199
bitcoin

2435
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:40,799
the conditions of its launch were

2436
01:22:39,198 --> 01:22:42,319
extremely favorable and hard to

2437
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,360
replicate

2438
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:45,519
can you speak to some of those

2439
01:22:43,359 --> 01:22:49,359
conditions why it's a unique uh

2440
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,920
timing wise uh moment for bitcoin to

2441
01:22:49,359 --> 01:22:52,158
emerge

2442
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:53,920
yeah so obviously bitcoin was born in

2443
01:22:52,158 --> 01:22:55,679
the depths of the financial crisis which

2444
01:22:53,920 --> 01:22:59,279
gives it a nice

2445
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:00,960
nice historical element but that was

2446
01:22:59,279 --> 01:23:02,719
kind of a coincidence honestly we know

2447
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:06,880
that satoshi had been working on it

2448
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:08,719
earlier in back or in 2017.

2449
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,480
um the really special thing about

2450
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:13,600
bitcoin was that

2451
01:23:10,479 --> 01:23:15,919
it was launched anonymously by an entity

2452
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,880
that did not seek any glory or credit

2453
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,679
for what they did

2454
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,199
and apparently never monetized it at all

2455
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:24,158
so they never really

2456
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:26,158
moved any of their coins satoshi sent

2457
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:28,000
one test transaction

2458
01:23:26,158 --> 01:23:29,759
to uh hal finney who's one of the

2459
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:31,039
earliest bitcoiners

2460
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,440
aside from that as far as we know

2461
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:35,519
satoshi never spent any of their coins

2462
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:36,879
so you have this wonderful promethean

2463
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,280
quality

2464
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:40,159
whereby it's almost self-sacrificial i

2465
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:43,279
mean

2466
01:23:40,158 --> 01:23:46,079
it's like this borderline god-like

2467
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:47,920
figure in terms of their restraint

2468
01:23:46,079 --> 01:23:49,519
finds this monetary technology and

2469
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,520
releases it to the world

2470
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,520
and pays the price they never took

2471
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,880
advantage of their filthy luger you know

2472
01:23:53,520 --> 01:23:56,880
they never

2473
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:58,239
they never recognized any of the 50

2474
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:01,840
billion dollars that they

2475
01:23:58,238 --> 01:24:02,799
made from bitcoin right and satoshi also

2476
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:05,520
didn't

2477
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:07,279
assign themselves any privileged access

2478
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,719
uh to the coins you know satoshi could

2479
01:24:07,279 --> 01:24:11,519
have just written in the code

2480
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:12,719
i own ten percent of the coins but they

2481
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:14,400
didn't they just mined

2482
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:16,000
in the open free market competition like

2483
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:18,158
everyone else it's just that

2484
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,119
satoshi is an early miner to support the

2485
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:21,359
network

2486
01:24:19,119 --> 01:24:22,559
accumulate a lot of coins for sure but

2487
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:25,519
they didn't have any privilege

2488
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:25,920
special access so that's one thing

2489
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:28,000
that's

2490
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:29,279
extremely special about the launch is

2491
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:31,119
that we had a founder

2492
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:32,800
that was truly committed to the monetary

2493
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:36,079
protocol and didn't seek

2494
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:38,400
either recognition or financial spoils

2495
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:39,760
and then also left you know satoshi left

2496
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:42,079
in 2010

2497
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:44,239
2011 and hasn't really been heard from

2498
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:47,198
since it's a very george washington

2499
01:24:44,238 --> 01:24:49,439
move gangster move where he didn't want

2500
01:24:47,198 --> 01:24:49,678
power and once he got power he let go of

2501
01:24:49,439 --> 01:24:53,039
it

2502
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:55,679
precisely that was a key actually move

2503
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:56,880
when that was that was uh probably one

2504
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:58,319
of the most important moves at the

2505
01:24:56,880 --> 01:24:59,600
founding of this country

2506
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:02,158
that's right george washington could

2507
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:04,639
have been a king probably if he'd wanted

2508
01:25:02,158 --> 01:25:05,279
and satoshi could have been jerome

2509
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:07,520
powell

2510
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:09,198
if he'd wanted and satoshi could have

2511
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,679
held on to power

2512
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:13,119
indefinitely but chose to leave the

2513
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,119
other thing is that bitcoin

2514
01:25:13,119 --> 01:25:17,359
circulated for a long period of time

2515
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:20,880
from january 2009

2516
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:23,119
to about july 2010

2517
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:24,000
without really having a financial value

2518
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:25,599
so

2519
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,039
there weren't really any marketplaces it

2520
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,600
didn't have a value

2521
01:25:27,039 --> 01:25:30,880
and so that gave it this really great

2522
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:32,480
distribution

2523
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,880
you know among a broad set of

2524
01:25:32,479 --> 01:25:36,559
stakeholders and there were no venture

2525
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:38,400
funds or hedge funds

2526
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,320
you know trying to aggressively buy up

2527
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:42,079
all the supply back then

2528
01:25:40,319 --> 01:25:44,000
now when you have new cryptocurrencies

2529
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:44,960
launched they're like aggressively

2530
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,679
pre-mined

2531
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:48,079
and some gigantic silicon valley venture

2532
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:51,119
fund

2533
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:52,719
is going to own 30 of it and so it's

2534
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:54,559
sort of impossible to conceive of how

2535
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:57,920
that could become a global money

2536
01:25:54,560 --> 01:26:01,199
because how could you know a

2537
01:25:57,920 --> 01:26:02,639
silicon valley investment firm own

2538
01:26:01,198 --> 01:26:04,879
30 percent of the money supply that

2539
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:07,920
doesn't make sense that's just so

2540
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:10,159
oligarchical right it's unbelievable so

2541
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:11,600
bitcoin by contracts is a very bottom-up

2542
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:14,960
thing

2543
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:17,920
it was the early enthusiasts uh

2544
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,800
people that were you know really um

2545
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:21,119
excited about the

2546
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:23,440
technology they're the ones that obtain

2547
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:25,439
those early coins and so

2548
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:27,519
there was a real element of fairness and

2549
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:29,039
just an organic nature to its launch

2550
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:30,960
which would be incredibly hard to

2551
01:26:29,039 --> 01:26:34,158
recapture today let's say

2552
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:36,239
satoshi came back and they

2553
01:26:34,158 --> 01:26:37,439
said okay i made bitcoin 2.0 i'm going

2554
01:26:36,238 --> 01:26:39,759
to release it

2555
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,198
there would be the most aggressive land

2556
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,560
grab ever

2557
01:26:41,198 --> 01:26:47,279
by you know gigantic pools of capital to

2558
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:48,159
sort of get favorable allocations of the

2559
01:26:47,279 --> 01:26:51,920
new system

2560
01:26:48,158 --> 01:26:52,960
right can satoshi with bitcoin 2.0 build

2561
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,079
in

2562
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:58,000
a resistance mechanism or a prevention

2563
01:26:56,079 --> 01:27:00,960
mechanism for the land grab

2564
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,800
it would be hard to because you know if

2565
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,399
you have capital and resources

2566
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:05,840
i mean if it was a proof of work chain

2567
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:07,759
you just have people that would invest a

2568
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,600
ton of money in mining for instance

2569
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,199
but most new blockchains

2570
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,520
cryptocurrencies are just

2571
01:27:11,198 --> 01:27:16,559
sold basically they're you know issued

2572
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:18,560
in token offerings kind of thing so

2573
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:20,800
so it's hard to enforce through the

2574
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:23,360
protocol the decentralization of

2575
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,719
control yeah power it'd be challenging

2576
01:27:23,359 --> 01:27:25,759
too and people have tried to do air

2577
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:28,319
drops you know

2578
01:27:25,760 --> 01:27:29,520
where they you know distribute coins to

2579
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:30,559
a large number of people basically

2580
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,920
doesn't work

2581
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,960
most people don't care about the air

2582
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,158
drop so it's hard to have an equitable

2583
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:37,840
distribution

2584
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:39,599
i think the conditions of bitcoin's

2585
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:42,319
launch were so lucky

2586
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:44,000
and favorable that they're very unlikely

2587
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:46,000
to be replicated

2588
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,479
so i do think it's going to be real

2589
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:51,760
challenge to ever have a new competitor

2590
01:27:48,479 --> 01:27:54,238
that's as decentralized as leaderless as

2591
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:56,079
dispersed sort of distributed as bitcoin

2592
01:27:54,238 --> 01:27:58,238
as has its credibility

2593
01:27:56,079 --> 01:27:59,760
i don't know how you could overrule it

2594
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:02,638
on those important features

2595
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:04,320
what about bitcoins comparison to other

2596
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:07,440
current cryptocurrencies so

2597
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:10,799
bitcoin versus ethereum for example

2598
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:12,158
why um is it possible that ethereum

2599
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,000
overtakes bitcoin

2600
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:15,279
that's certainly possible yeah i'm not

2601
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,079
ruling it out

2602
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:19,840
um ethereum leadership is sort of wise

2603
01:28:18,079 --> 01:28:22,399
enough to understand

2604
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:23,039
that they shouldn't compete with bitcoin

2605
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:26,559
on those

2606
01:28:23,039 --> 01:28:28,639
most profound qualities like ethereum

2607
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:31,679
doesn't really aspire to be

2608
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:32,800
more sound from a monetary perspective

2609
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:33,920
than bitcoin

2610
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:35,360
right the in fact the ethereum

2611
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,600
leadership are sort of constantly

2612
01:28:35,359 --> 01:28:39,439
tweaking the monetary policy

2613
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,199
so they went for a completely different

2614
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:44,000
trade-off right

2615
01:28:41,198 --> 01:28:45,599
they also don't compete to be as

2616
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,800
decentralized from a governance

2617
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:48,320
perspective right

2618
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,639
because there's leadership there's an

2619
01:28:48,319 --> 01:28:52,319
eth foundation there's a charismatic

2620
01:28:50,639 --> 01:28:54,960
leader of italic

2621
01:28:52,319 --> 01:28:55,599
and ethereum has this policy of hard

2622
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:59,039
forks

2623
01:28:55,600 --> 01:29:00,880
so in bitcoin hard forks extremely rare

2624
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:02,880
in ethereum it's the default way to

2625
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:05,440
change things so it's a much

2626
01:29:02,880 --> 01:29:06,400
more adaptive system and it changes more

2627
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:08,638
frequently

2628
01:29:06,399 --> 01:29:10,000
but that also means that it's sort of

2629
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:11,840
they're incurring more risk

2630
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:14,158
when they introduce those changes

2631
01:29:11,840 --> 01:29:16,960
there's much more complexity so

2632
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:18,879
ethereum is smart because they sort of

2633
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:20,000
understood bitcoin as the top dog when

2634
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,679
it comes to a sound

2635
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:25,039
money a digital gold type thing

2636
01:29:23,679 --> 01:29:27,840
and they went for all of the different

2637
01:29:25,039 --> 01:29:30,079
trade-offs they wanted to be

2638
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:32,880
more of a platform they wanted to have

2639
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:34,960
more complexity the transactional layer

2640
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:36,560
they wanted to take on more risk in

2641
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,800
terms of changing the protocol they

2642
01:29:36,560 --> 01:29:40,960
wanted to change more quickly

2643
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:42,480
they wanted to make the monetary policy

2644
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:45,679
more mutable

2645
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:47,039
so ethereum takes that completely

2646
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:48,239
different tack of course

2647
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:50,560
you know i'm not ruling out that it

2648
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:52,079
could take over bitcoin from a market

2649
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:55,360
cap perspective

2650
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:56,719
it's just a very different system and i

2651
01:29:55,359 --> 01:29:58,639
tend to think the bitcoin is the most

2652
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:01,600
disruptive one because it's

2653
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,239
the most equipped to challenge sovereign

2654
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,840
currencies

2655
01:30:02,238 --> 01:30:06,158
in the grand scheme do you think they

2656
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:08,880
can co-exist

2657
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:10,799
so like in the future is do you see a

2658
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:13,920
world where

2659
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:16,800
you know uh ethereum captures

2660
01:30:13,920 --> 01:30:19,039
some large percent of the market and but

2661
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:22,000
nevertheless the minority

2662
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:24,158
a hundred percent 100 percent bitcoin

2663
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:26,800
has already been tokenized and put

2664
01:30:24,158 --> 01:30:28,799
on to ethereum many units of bitcoin i

2665
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:31,440
think over a billion dollars worth

2666
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:33,520
so not only do they coexist they are

2667
01:30:31,439 --> 01:30:35,519
actually mutualistic

2668
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:38,239
so they're like two creatures that have

2669
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:40,560
this you know it's like the

2670
01:30:38,238 --> 01:30:42,479
the rhino and like the bird the pecks

2671
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,199
the parasites off the rhino's back or

2672
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:45,039
whatever

2673
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:46,879
yeah right so i don't know which is

2674
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:50,399
which in the analogy but

2675
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,400
yeah i don't know who the parasites are

2676
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:56,079
yellow or you know the alligator and the

2677
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:57,520
teeth cleaning fish or whatever right so

2678
01:30:56,079 --> 01:30:58,719
oh you know i always wonder why the

2679
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:01,120
alligator doesn't just

2680
01:30:58,719 --> 01:31:02,000
eat the fish but uh i guess they're

2681
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:05,519
brushing its teeth

2682
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,279
basically so um ethereum

2683
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:08,800
is it gives you more transactional

2684
01:31:07,279 --> 01:31:10,800
flexibility there's much more

2685
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:13,039
experimentation happening there

2686
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,079
it has this whole decentralized finance

2687
01:31:13,039 --> 01:31:15,840
element

2688
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:18,079
there's a huge number of bitcoins that

2689
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:20,560
circulate on the ethereum protocol

2690
01:31:18,079 --> 01:31:21,439
right because ethereum is open to other

2691
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:24,320
asset types

2692
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:26,559
basically so i think that's actually

2693
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:28,399
accretive to both systems

2694
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:30,239
because ethereum gets to have this good

2695
01:31:28,399 --> 01:31:32,799
form of collateral bitcoin

2696
01:31:30,238 --> 01:31:34,079
on the system which is good volatility

2697
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:37,679
characteristics

2698
01:31:34,079 --> 01:31:40,399
and then it's a supply sync for bitcoins

2699
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:42,399
which are sort of now they're injected

2700
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:45,599
into this third-party protocol

2701
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:47,119
and that i think reduces the velocity of

2702
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:48,960
bitcoin overall and it's probably good

2703
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:51,119
for the valuation

2704
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:53,039
so you see it it quite possibly could be

2705
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:53,599
a symbiotic relationship that's really

2706
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:56,479
interesting

2707
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,199
i think so i think so uh what are your

2708
01:31:56,479 --> 01:32:01,039
thoughts

2709
01:31:57,198 --> 01:32:03,279
about uh vitalik buterin

2710
01:32:01,039 --> 01:32:05,198
what are your thoughts about some of the

2711
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:08,238
other figures in the space

2712
01:32:05,198 --> 01:32:09,919
outside of bitcoin i think vitalik made

2713
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:12,718
some mistakes with ethereum

2714
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:14,399
ultimately like i disagree with some of

2715
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,399
the decisions that were made

2716
01:32:14,399 --> 01:32:17,920
along the way like there's this infamous

2717
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:21,039
case of this bailout

2718
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:22,239
where 14 of ether was lost in the smart

2719
01:32:21,039 --> 01:32:25,039
contract

2720
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:26,718
or really the this smart contract that a

2721
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:29,198
lot of ethereum leadership were sort of

2722
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:31,920
backing and supporting was hacked

2723
01:32:29,198 --> 01:32:33,198
and then the foundation with vitalik

2724
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:36,480
support

2725
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:37,519
chose to make a change to the underlying

2726
01:32:36,479 --> 01:32:40,799
protocol

2727
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:44,480
to undo the hack right so

2728
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:46,800
to me that was not the most

2729
01:32:44,479 --> 01:32:48,079
prudent approach because you're

2730
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:50,239
basically

2731
01:32:48,079 --> 01:32:52,399
violating the core protocol rules in

2732
01:32:50,238 --> 01:32:55,359
order to undo

2733
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:56,319
you know to bail out a specific contract

2734
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:57,839
which is failed

2735
01:32:56,319 --> 01:32:59,519
granted there was a lot of ether in

2736
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,360
there but

2737
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,639
i think that shook the credibility of

2738
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:05,599
the ethereum system

2739
01:33:02,639 --> 01:33:07,119
it happened back in 2016 i think uh that

2740
01:33:05,600 --> 01:33:09,760
was one reason why i

2741
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:11,279
i became disenchanted with ethereum so

2742
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:14,560
basically

2743
01:33:11,279 --> 01:33:17,119
even if in that case that might fix an

2744
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:20,320
important problem that opens the door

2745
01:33:17,119 --> 01:33:22,000
to centralized like

2746
01:33:20,319 --> 01:33:24,158
manipulation of the protocol in the

2747
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:25,600
future yeah it basically demonstrates

2748
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:28,479
that there's certain elites

2749
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:30,239
at the protocol level that can exercise

2750
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:33,279
specific control

2751
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:35,678
over the system and you know

2752
01:33:33,279 --> 01:33:37,599
a lot of people have lost money in hacks

2753
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:38,639
on ethereum and a lot of contracts have

2754
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:41,120
gone south

2755
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:42,400
a huge amount of value but they didn't

2756
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:44,479
get a bailout

2757
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:45,759
and it was just when you know this

2758
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:49,198
specific

2759
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:52,239
contract called the dao dao

2760
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:53,519
was hacked that you know the leadership

2761
01:33:52,238 --> 01:33:55,198
intervened

2762
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:57,360
and and you know to their credit they

2763
01:33:55,198 --> 01:33:59,439
haven't had a significant intervention

2764
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:02,079
or bailout since then

2765
01:33:59,439 --> 01:34:04,638
but it did normalize the practice and i

2766
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:07,359
think it weakened the social contract

2767
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:09,199
so i would prefer that you sort of bite

2768
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:11,439
the bullet in that situation

2769
01:34:09,198 --> 01:34:12,238
and you accept the failure of that

2770
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:15,039
contract

2771
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:15,599
that would be a ballsy move to bite that

2772
01:34:15,039 --> 01:34:17,039
bullet

2773
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:18,800
yeah i mean and then you would have had

2774
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:19,519
like what they thought was a malicious

2775
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:21,840
entity in

2776
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:22,960
control of a lot of coins i think the

2777
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,679
real reason they

2778
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:27,198
sort of felt that they had to undo it

2779
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:29,359
was because they'd always plan to move

2780
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:31,039
to this proof-of-stake world

2781
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:33,519
where your political control over the

2782
01:34:31,039 --> 01:34:34,639
system is a function of your wealth in

2783
01:34:33,520 --> 01:34:37,120
the system

2784
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:38,319
and they didn't want this attacker which

2785
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:40,800
would have inherited

2786
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:42,000
all this significant wealth to have

2787
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,320
influence

2788
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,000
over that future proof of stake version

2789
01:34:44,319 --> 01:34:49,118
that's sort of my theory

2790
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:50,719
yeah i mean that makes sense this it

2791
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:54,479
kind of reminds me

2792
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:56,800
of the bailout of car companies

2793
01:34:54,479 --> 01:34:58,479
you know this this is difficult there's

2794
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:59,520
a lot of people that criticize the

2795
01:34:58,479 --> 01:35:02,158
bailout of these

2796
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,600
large companies you know but creative

2797
01:35:02,158 --> 01:35:05,599
destruction i mean i

2798
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:06,639
i was critical of the bailouts that

2799
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:09,360
happened

2800
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:11,600
during covid i mean i generally think

2801
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:13,759
that it's healthier for society for

2802
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,840
bad firms that aren't making money to

2803
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:17,760
fail or be reorganized

2804
01:35:15,840 --> 01:35:19,199
under the various you know forms of

2805
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:23,039
bankruptcy

2806
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:25,519
and you saw what happens you see the

2807
01:35:23,039 --> 01:35:27,039
you know the corporate sector in japan

2808
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,400
uh in the 90s

2809
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:30,079
there was this like slow motion

2810
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:32,319
insolvency where

2811
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:34,719
basically firms weren't allowed to fail

2812
01:35:32,319 --> 01:35:36,158
and the japanese corporate sector lost

2813
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:39,279
competitiveness because

2814
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:40,719
bad firms did not fail and so

2815
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:42,719
you know the process of actual

2816
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:44,239
capitalism for the market clearing

2817
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:47,679
didn't occur

2818
01:35:44,238 --> 01:35:49,039
so i'm always in support of um

2819
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:51,440
you know of the free market being

2820
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:52,880
allowed to clear for non-profitable

2821
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:55,919
firms to fail

2822
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:57,679
it's complicated man because uh creative

2823
01:35:55,920 --> 01:36:01,279
destruction

2824
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:05,679
seems to be in the long term a positive

2825
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:08,319
but human civilization is such that

2826
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:09,039
short-term pain has real impact on

2827
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:11,519
people

2828
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:13,198
you know yeah policymakers don't ever

2829
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,880
want to incur that short-term pain

2830
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:18,158
because they have a short-term

2831
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:21,118
outlook and term limits often

2832
01:36:18,158 --> 01:36:21,679
so but and also just it's short-term

2833
01:36:21,118 --> 01:36:23,118
pain

2834
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:26,880
forget policy they just forget

2835
01:36:23,118 --> 01:36:30,399
politicians it sucks to lose a job

2836
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:32,239
for an individual you know you could say

2837
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:33,519
the company the creative destruction of

2838
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:35,519
a company

2839
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:37,760
means the company was inefficient and

2840
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:39,360
that's going to have a ripple effect

2841
01:36:37,760 --> 01:36:41,440
of teaching everybody else what an

2842
01:36:39,359 --> 01:36:43,118
efficient operation looks like

2843
01:36:41,439 --> 01:36:45,198
but like there's jobs that are being

2844
01:36:43,118 --> 01:36:47,599
lost there's families that have to

2845
01:36:45,198 --> 01:36:50,559
suffer because of that i mean

2846
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:51,360
that's attention we live in society is

2847
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:55,119
having a

2848
01:36:51,359 --> 01:36:58,799
basic safety net for our world um

2849
01:36:55,118 --> 01:37:01,359
because there's a level beyond which

2850
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:02,239
like if through creative destruction

2851
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:04,158
that you have

2852
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:06,399
some percent of the population that dips

2853
01:37:04,158 --> 01:37:06,960
below a certain level that you would

2854
01:37:06,399 --> 01:37:10,079
call

2855
01:37:06,960 --> 01:37:10,960
like suffering we don't want that and

2856
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:13,760
that's a difficult

2857
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:15,520
thing to live with like yes in the long

2858
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:18,480
term

2859
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:19,119
you want inefficiency to be destroyed

2860
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:22,158
and

2861
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:24,319
efficiency to be rewarded but there

2862
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:26,079
there does seem to be a base level of

2863
01:37:24,319 --> 01:37:28,000
like quality of life

2864
01:37:26,079 --> 01:37:29,600
that we want to uphold that's a

2865
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,520
difficult thing to think about i think

2866
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:35,920
about that a lot there's a doctor called

2867
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:38,960
paul farmer that um

2868
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:41,440
you know there's like a in in haiti or

2869
01:37:38,960 --> 01:37:43,439
in africa there's a child who's dying

2870
01:37:41,439 --> 01:37:46,000
and as a doctor

2871
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:47,678
you want to give everything you have all

2872
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,760
the money you have to save that one

2873
01:37:47,679 --> 01:37:52,639
child

2874
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:55,360
but there you know and you do actually

2875
01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:58,319
but that's uh

2876
01:37:55,359 --> 01:37:59,118
that's a very human action it's not an

2877
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:02,000
economic

2878
01:37:59,118 --> 01:38:03,519
it's not a it's not a rational action

2879
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,520
from a game theoretic perspective

2880
01:38:03,520 --> 01:38:07,600
because there's no way you can take that

2881
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:09,360
action for every child who is suffering

2882
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:12,079
but there's something deeply human about

2883
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:14,960
doing that for that one particular child

2884
01:38:12,079 --> 01:38:17,519
in that same sense creative destruction

2885
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:20,239
is an economic principle

2886
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,080
but it's not it's not necessarily that

2887
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:24,718
same kind of human principle

2888
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,000
and there's a tension there i've i see

2889
01:38:24,719 --> 01:38:28,239
it i mean i think that's

2890
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,760
the that's the issue with modern central

2891
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:31,919
banking really is that

2892
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:32,880
the central bank always has an incentive

2893
01:38:31,920 --> 01:38:34,719
to

2894
01:38:32,880 --> 01:38:36,400
lower interest rates and they've been

2895
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:38,800
doing that from the 70s

2896
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:40,879
towards today on this you know well 80s

2897
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,960
really on this slow march down

2898
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,719
because whenever there was a hint of a

2899
01:38:42,960 --> 01:38:46,560
crisis in the economy

2900
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:48,079
where financial asset prices started to

2901
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,239
fall

2902
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:52,719
their reaction is okay we'll inject more

2903
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:55,759
capital into the economy we'll save it

2904
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:57,520
but my view is that these political

2905
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,880
short-term measures

2906
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,880
cause the buildup of a huge amount of

2907
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:03,279
fragility in the long term and then the

2908
01:39:00,880 --> 01:39:05,760
ultimate collapse is much worse

2909
01:39:03,279 --> 01:39:07,359
than the counterfactual situation where

2910
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:10,159
you raised interest rates

2911
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:12,158
you you know you took your medicine and

2912
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:14,319
the economy was healthier

2913
01:39:12,158 --> 01:39:15,519
so and that's sort of that's why you

2914
01:39:14,319 --> 01:39:17,439
know people like ray dolly

2915
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:18,960
point out that you have these long-term

2916
01:39:17,439 --> 01:39:21,359
debt cycles

2917
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:23,359
and we're sort of at the end of one now

2918
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:26,158
is because we couldn't

2919
01:39:23,359 --> 01:39:28,000
take our medicine we couldn't you know

2920
01:39:26,158 --> 01:39:30,879
let interest rates clear

2921
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:32,639
we constantly wanted to ward off any you

2922
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,840
know difficulty and we didn't ever want

2923
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:37,199
to deleverage

2924
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:39,440
truly and then when the when the debt

2925
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:43,198
crisis happens and it hits

2926
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:43,198
it's you know horrendously bad

2927
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:49,679
so do you think bitcoin might reach

2928
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:52,560
a million dollars in value it's

2929
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:54,079
uh it's having a current resurgence a

2930
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:57,520
crazy one in 2021

2931
01:39:54,079 --> 01:39:59,198
in the recent months of uh over 60 000 i

2932
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:00,639
guess it is now

2933
01:39:59,198 --> 01:40:02,000
do you think it's possible it goes over

2934
01:40:00,639 --> 01:40:03,359
a hundred thousand do you think it's

2935
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:06,319
possible goes to a million

2936
01:40:03,359 --> 01:40:06,719
you can't rule anything out with bitcoin

2937
01:40:06,319 --> 01:40:08,479
so

2938
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:10,399
i mean i'm not you know wanted to put

2939
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:12,238
price targets on it but

2940
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:14,479
one way it could reach a million dollars

2941
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:15,198
is bitcoin's value stays unchanged in

2942
01:40:14,479 --> 01:40:17,359
real terms

2943
01:40:15,198 --> 01:40:19,678
and dollars crashes all it appreciates

2944
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:22,238
against

2945
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,960
um not that i expect hyperinflation but

2946
01:40:22,238 --> 01:40:25,279
yeah i mean

2947
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,719
look bitcoin is worth about one tenth uh

2948
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:28,800
slightly under one tenth the value of

2949
01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:30,800
all the gold in the world

2950
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,880
and uh you know gold is worth ten

2951
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,159
trillion eleven trillion dollars in the

2952
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,000
aggregate

2953
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:38,319
do i think bitcoin can be more

2954
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:41,520
culturally and economically salient than

2955
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:45,039
gold in two decades time

2956
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:47,440
100 bitcoin was unknown

2957
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:48,319
12 years ago and today 100 million

2958
01:40:47,439 --> 01:40:51,839
people worldwide

2959
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:53,359
own bitcoin so just extrapolate that

2960
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:56,960
what is the level of penetration you

2961
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:59,679
think we'll get 500 million a billion

2962
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:01,039
you know it you can easily tune these

2963
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:03,520
adoption curves

2964
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,479
however you like i i don't think it's

2965
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:06,719
done

2966
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:08,079
you know monetizing and being adopted

2967
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:09,600
globally

2968
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:11,198
do you think it become it can become

2969
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:13,600
like the base layer for a lot of our

2970
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:15,678
financial operation like you become

2971
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:18,239
the main base layer for all our

2972
01:41:15,679 --> 01:41:20,960
transactions so like even

2973
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:22,559
banks will use bitcoin essentially and

2974
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:24,319
like visa would use bitcoin

2975
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:26,080
as the base there like it would actually

2976
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:28,238
operate very similarly at the

2977
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:29,840
at the surface layer but at the base

2978
01:41:28,238 --> 01:41:31,759
there would all be bitcoin

2979
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:34,319
that's precisely what i expect and banks

2980
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:37,520
and visa are already using bitcoin

2981
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:39,198
so visa has uh

2982
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,800
embraced bitcoin in a really big way

2983
01:41:39,198 --> 01:41:42,479
actually and it's always funny to the

2984
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:43,840
people saying bitcoin has to

2985
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,799
change in a certain way so you can

2986
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,760
compete with visa no visa adopted

2987
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:50,960
bitcoin

2988
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:53,520
right uh paypal adopted bitcoin

2989
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:55,198
square adopted bitcoin obviously they're

2990
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:56,800
not tearing out all of their existing

2991
01:41:55,198 --> 01:41:59,279
infrastructure but

2992
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:00,159
they're totally engaging with this thing

2993
01:41:59,279 --> 01:42:02,479
uh banks

2994
01:42:00,158 --> 01:42:03,920
have now begun they got the green light

2995
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:06,079
to provide custody

2996
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:07,440
for bitcoin for their depositors that's

2997
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:10,319
the first step

2998
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:12,319
uh eventually like you know it'll happen

2999
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:14,079
one of two ways either bitcoin native

3000
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:16,559
financial institutions will become

3001
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:18,000
banks that's already happening there's

3002
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:19,679
bitcoin exchanges that have gotten

3003
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:22,079
banking licenses

3004
01:42:19,679 --> 01:42:22,880
or banks themselves will start to engage

3005
01:42:22,079 --> 01:42:25,840
with bitcoin

3006
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,800
as a reserve asset it'll converge either

3007
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,840
way that's

3008
01:42:26,800 --> 01:42:31,279
totally happening uh and yes i mean i

3009
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,880
don't think bitcoin is going to power

3010
01:42:31,279 --> 01:42:34,079
every financial transaction i think it

3011
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:37,199
will coexist

3012
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:37,920
alongside sovereign currencies but i

3013
01:42:37,198 --> 01:42:40,879
think it's a

3014
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:43,118
great reserve asset it's a very powerful

3015
01:42:40,880 --> 01:42:43,840
asset to build a financial system on top

3016
01:42:43,118 --> 01:42:46,960
of

3017
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:48,319
because it's highly highly auditable

3018
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,239
it's something you can take physical

3019
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:51,679
delivery of very cheaply and those are

3020
01:42:50,238 --> 01:42:54,158
great qualities

3021
01:42:51,679 --> 01:42:56,319
if you're a depositor in a bank they can

3022
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:58,559
prove to you how much bitcoin they have

3023
01:42:56,319 --> 01:43:00,079
they can't really easily prove you know

3024
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,920
in the old system how much gold they

3025
01:43:00,079 --> 01:43:03,840
held on deposit

3026
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:06,000
and you can easily conduct a run on the

3027
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:09,199
bank you can hold them accountable

3028
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:10,719
because you can withdraw it because

3029
01:43:09,198 --> 01:43:12,479
you know making a bitcoin transaction is

3030
01:43:10,719 --> 01:43:14,480
pretty easy at the end of the day

3031
01:43:12,479 --> 01:43:16,079
unlike fiat currency it's like kind of

3032
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:17,919
you can't really withdraw all your

3033
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:19,920
dollars from the bank i mean

3034
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,118
you sort of can but you're not going to

3035
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:24,158
want to take delivery of

3036
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:27,279
pounds of cash or anything like that so

3037
01:43:24,158 --> 01:43:27,920
it's a good modern asset upon which to

3038
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:31,279
build

3039
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:32,480
a financial system basically you you

3040
01:43:31,279 --> 01:43:35,198
mentioned square and

3041
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:36,399
visa sort of investing in bitcoin what

3042
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:38,399
do you make of uh

3043
01:43:36,399 --> 01:43:40,479
probably one of the higher profile big

3044
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:42,719
investments in bitcoin which is tesla

3045
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:44,319
and elon musk but there's also a few

3046
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:44,800
billionaires like chamath and all of

3047
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:46,639
them

3048
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:48,000
investing what do you make of this whole

3049
01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:48,400
movement why do you think they're doing

3050
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,158
it

3051
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:52,559
i mean tesla is an interesting case why

3052
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:54,879
do you think tesla's putting uh

3053
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:56,480
buying so much bitcoin i honestly don't

3054
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,440
know and i would love to truly know

3055
01:43:56,479 --> 01:44:01,919
elon's genuine thoughts on bitcoin

3056
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:02,719
um because he's kind of sending us mixed

3057
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,480
messages

3058
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:08,960
honestly with his embrace of dogecoin

3059
01:44:06,479 --> 01:44:09,599
which is sort of playful not exactly

3060
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:11,118
sure which one

3061
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:12,639
what point he's trying to make there so

3062
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:14,399
you were involved with deutsche kern you

3063
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:16,000
mentioned offline a little bit

3064
01:44:14,399 --> 01:44:17,599
in like in the early days or at least

3065
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,359
like uh

3066
01:44:17,600 --> 01:44:20,639
played around with it what do you make

3067
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:21,679
of deutsche coin what do you make of

3068
01:44:20,639 --> 01:44:25,039
elon and doge

3069
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:27,920
what do you make of this particular

3070
01:44:25,039 --> 01:44:30,079
meme coin is it is it one like a

3071
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:33,440
legitimate cryptocurrency

3072
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:36,000
or is it too like a

3073
01:44:33,439 --> 01:44:36,799
funny internet way of saying fu to the

3074
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:40,000
man

3075
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:41,840
yeah it's it's a good question i mean so

3076
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,439
i wasn't like a figurehead in dogecoin

3077
01:44:41,840 --> 01:44:45,119
or anything but that was totally my

3078
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:48,399
introduction to crypto was

3079
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:51,679
mining dogecoin in my dorm room and then

3080
01:44:48,399 --> 01:44:52,238
tipping people online in dogecoin which

3081
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:55,760
i just

3082
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:55,759
thought was the funniest thing

3083
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:59,600
so i guess that was really easy to

3084
01:44:57,198 --> 01:45:02,000
entertain back in 2013

3085
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:04,400
but it was very playful at the time

3086
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,880
there was a culture around dogecoin

3087
01:45:04,399 --> 01:45:08,879
and the people liked it because it was

3088
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:11,118
in opposition to the bitcoin culture

3089
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:13,199
which was really serious and involved

3090
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:15,118
lots of austrian economics

3091
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:16,799
and rothbard and hayek and stuff like

3092
01:45:15,118 --> 01:45:18,479
that so

3093
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,239
that was my introduction to

3094
01:45:18,479 --> 01:45:21,759
cryptocurrency was because

3095
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:23,759
i thought the bitcoin people were pretty

3096
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:25,520
lame yeah and they were like way too

3097
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:28,079
serious about all this stuff

3098
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:29,520
and i was like okay i'll just be a part

3099
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:31,760
of the dogecoin community and they did

3100
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:34,080
all these funny publicity stunts like

3101
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,840
they paid to send the jamaican bobsled

3102
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:38,559
team to the olympics

3103
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:41,039
you know like great stuff like they put

3104
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:43,520
the dogecoin logo on top of a nascar car

3105
01:45:41,039 --> 01:45:45,039
yeah um and i just that tickled me so

3106
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,600
much because it's like this

3107
01:45:45,039 --> 01:45:49,279
made-up internet coin this was back when

3108
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:50,960
crypto was pretty novel and still like

3109
01:45:49,279 --> 01:45:53,599
kind of funny and stuff

3110
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:54,079
and that was really entertaining fast

3111
01:45:53,600 --> 01:45:56,960
forward

3112
01:45:54,079 --> 01:45:59,118
seven eight years dogecoin is way less

3113
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:01,920
entertaining now frankly because

3114
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:02,880
it's the leadership left the community

3115
01:46:01,920 --> 01:46:06,158
spirit

3116
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:07,760
evaporated um the meme didn't persist i

3117
01:46:06,158 --> 01:46:08,879
mean doge itself is not really a

3118
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:10,719
contemporary meme

3119
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:13,118
right i mean it's an old meme although

3120
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:15,198
that new refresher the meme like doji

3121
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:18,238
haven't heard that name in a long time

3122
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:20,079
like where does like in a hat smoking a

3123
01:46:18,238 --> 01:46:22,879
cigarette i mean there's some sense

3124
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:24,399
where elon is reinvigorating the meme

3125
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:26,719
and it's funny because like one

3126
01:46:24,399 --> 01:46:28,960
influential figure could

3127
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:30,560
do just that which just speaks to the

3128
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:33,359
tension that you're talking about

3129
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:35,679
like tesla is investing bitcoin and yet

3130
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:39,198
elon he also tweets about bitcoin but

3131
01:46:35,679 --> 01:46:42,480
yeah he's i mean who am i to question

3132
01:46:39,198 --> 01:46:44,319
the meme right like yeah i i can't

3133
01:46:42,479 --> 01:46:46,000
you know dissect internet culture and

3134
01:46:44,319 --> 01:46:47,279
financially sit here and tell you it's

3135
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,279
an invalid meme

3136
01:46:47,279 --> 01:46:50,479
yeah you know if if people believe in it

3137
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:53,039
then it's real

3138
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:54,000
is there a space for meme coins at this

3139
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:56,238
at this time

3140
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:58,399
like like doge or somebody or somebody

3141
01:46:56,238 --> 01:47:00,718
else to almost like

3142
01:46:58,399 --> 01:47:01,839
um you know there's it does serve a lot

3143
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:05,118
of purposes which is

3144
01:47:01,840 --> 01:47:05,520
like you said it pulls in people into

3145
01:47:05,118 --> 01:47:07,759
this

3146
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:09,199
whole space of digital currency in the

3147
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:12,159
digital in

3148
01:47:09,198 --> 01:47:13,678
uh into cryptocurrency allow them to

3149
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:15,039
explore alarm to have fun

3150
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:17,840
as opposed to taking everything very

3151
01:47:15,039 --> 01:47:19,840
seriously is there still space for that

3152
01:47:17,840 --> 01:47:21,520
yeah yeah and i mean the crypto

3153
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:25,199
landscape is very broad

3154
01:47:21,520 --> 01:47:27,360
today so whatever you know cultural

3155
01:47:25,198 --> 01:47:28,799
element you seek to find within crypto

3156
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:31,118
you will find

3157
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,800
it was a bit different in 2013 because

3158
01:47:31,118 --> 01:47:34,880
bitcoin was kind of the only game in

3159
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:38,000
town there were a couple altcoins

3160
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:39,600
and so dogecoin made a lot of sense as a

3161
01:47:38,000 --> 01:47:40,960
counterpart to bitcoin as the less

3162
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:43,199
serious counterpart

3163
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:44,000
today crypto is just this like gigantic

3164
01:47:43,198 --> 01:47:47,279
cultural

3165
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,639
and economic trend so it's you know very

3166
01:47:47,279 --> 01:47:51,679
multifaceted

3167
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:54,239
dogecoin is one of the many you know

3168
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:54,880
ways that people have to engage with it

3169
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:56,718
i think

3170
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:57,920
a lot of people that buy dogecoin based

3171
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:00,639
on elon's

3172
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:01,679
implied guidance are going to lose money

3173
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:03,279
because

3174
01:48:01,679 --> 01:48:05,520
fundamentally there's nothing enduring

3175
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:08,719
about dogecoin it's an ancient

3176
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:10,719
fork of bitcoin it's unmaintained

3177
01:48:08,719 --> 01:48:13,439
they're you know it's probably at risk

3178
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:16,319
actually from a protocol perspective

3179
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:17,359
it's merge mined with litecoin i think

3180
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:18,719
um

3181
01:48:17,359 --> 01:48:20,960
if there was an inflation bug on

3182
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:22,800
dogecoin it's unclear who would sort of

3183
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:25,679
be able to remediate that

3184
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:26,960
you know so it's not technologically

3185
01:48:25,679 --> 01:48:29,359
very sound

3186
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:30,800
um so i wouldn't recommend that anyone

3187
01:48:29,359 --> 01:48:32,799
stores wealth in it

3188
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:34,639
you know yes it's funny because

3189
01:48:32,800 --> 01:48:37,440
cryptocurrency

3190
01:48:34,639 --> 01:48:40,560
like my interest in cryptocurrency is in

3191
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:43,439
the exploration of technical ideas

3192
01:48:40,560 --> 01:48:45,119
but cryptocurrency is also like in the

3193
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:48,559
case of dogecoin

3194
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:51,679
uh like for lols at least

3195
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:56,639
originally like a meme coin but it's

3196
01:48:51,679 --> 01:49:00,880
also a uh mechanism for investment

3197
01:48:56,639 --> 01:49:04,639
and so those are sometimes attention

3198
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:06,719
100 and it's unclear sort of like yeah

3199
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:08,400
you know there's the meme with those

3200
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:10,800
just almost become to take it to

3201
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:13,359
i guess to a dollar trying to drive the

3202
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:16,000
price of the value up to a dollar

3203
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:17,679
but you know implied in that is like

3204
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,399
this overlap of the meme

3205
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:22,158
coin and like legitimate investment and

3206
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:22,960
so you have a lot of young people i

3207
01:49:22,158 --> 01:49:26,479
think

3208
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:29,679
who almost start getting greedy and want

3209
01:49:26,479 --> 01:49:32,319
to make money like as opposed to

3210
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:33,760
uh having fun and that becomes a

3211
01:49:32,319 --> 01:49:36,079
different beast then because you're

3212
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:38,239
essentially

3213
01:49:36,079 --> 01:49:39,359
making financial decisions that can have

3214
01:49:38,238 --> 01:49:42,799
a long lasting

3215
01:49:39,359 --> 01:49:46,238
like you know money is freedom

3216
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:47,760
and uh if you make stupid financial

3217
01:49:46,238 --> 01:49:50,079
decisions

3218
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,880
it you can remove freedom from your life

3219
01:49:50,079 --> 01:49:53,039
and that's

3220
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,960
it could be detrimental in that sense so

3221
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:56,079
i don't uh

3222
01:49:54,960 --> 01:49:58,719
it's difficult i don't know what to do

3223
01:49:56,079 --> 01:50:00,079
with that with that set of ideas because

3224
01:49:58,719 --> 01:50:01,920
a lot of cryptocurrency including

3225
01:50:00,079 --> 01:50:05,359
bitcoin is very volatile

3226
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:07,279
because it's new so you're trying to

3227
01:50:05,359 --> 01:50:10,238
figure out the space of like

3228
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:11,359
what's actually going to be a large part

3229
01:50:10,238 --> 01:50:13,039
of

3230
01:50:11,359 --> 01:50:15,359
like you speak of network effects like

3231
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:17,039
what's going to take over the world

3232
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:19,118
and uh through that process there's

3233
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:21,920
going to be a lot of volatility

3234
01:50:19,118 --> 01:50:22,880
and if you're talking about

3235
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:26,880
cryptocurrency

3236
01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:29,039
as a investment mechanism

3237
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:31,118
then it can have a real detrimental

3238
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:33,599
effects on people's lives

3239
01:50:31,118 --> 01:50:35,439
yeah and that's really the challenge

3240
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:38,719
with operating in the crypto space

3241
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:39,919
talking about it overlaid on top of

3242
01:50:38,719 --> 01:50:42,079
everything that's interesting

3243
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:43,440
politically or culturally about it is

3244
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:46,639
the financial incentive

3245
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:48,879
yeah and so you know it's not

3246
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:50,719
all fun and games because they're

3247
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:54,319
literally billions

3248
01:50:50,719 --> 01:50:56,158
over a trillion dollars at stake now so

3249
01:50:54,319 --> 01:50:58,079
if you buy dogecoin because some

3250
01:50:56,158 --> 01:51:00,158
influence around tick tock said so

3251
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:01,679
yeah you've now made a financial

3252
01:51:00,158 --> 01:51:04,000
decision right so

3253
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:05,118
i'm not gonna scold any dogecoin buyers

3254
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,840
or any

3255
01:51:05,118 --> 01:51:08,799
crypto asset buyer for that matter but

3256
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,719
be aware

3257
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:13,360
that there are like billions of dollars

3258
01:51:10,719 --> 01:51:15,520
of really elite hedge funds that are

3259
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:16,719
trying to front run all of your

3260
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:18,800
decisions and

3261
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:21,279
evaluate social sentiment things like

3262
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:22,639
that so it's water full of sharks

3263
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:24,079
basically

3264
01:51:22,639 --> 01:51:26,800
and by the way if you're listening to

3265
01:51:24,079 --> 01:51:28,479
this uh don't take this podcast

3266
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:30,320
or anything i ever say is financial

3267
01:51:28,479 --> 01:51:32,638
advice that's definitely not my interest

3268
01:51:30,319 --> 01:51:34,559
or expertise level

3269
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:36,400
the the interest here is to explore

3270
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:38,159
different ideas

3271
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:39,839
speaking of which you've written a

3272
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:43,679
little bit about nfts

3273
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:46,719
i'd be interested to hear your opinions

3274
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:49,279
on this space of ideas these

3275
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:53,599
non-fungible tokens

3276
01:51:49,279 --> 01:51:55,359
they seem to have a cultural impact

3277
01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:58,400
currently but do they have a long

3278
01:51:55,359 --> 01:52:00,960
lasting technical financial or cultural

3279
01:51:58,399 --> 01:52:03,359
impact or is this just a fad

3280
01:52:00,960 --> 01:52:05,198
what do you think of nfds yeah i think

3281
01:52:03,359 --> 01:52:07,598
the in current enthusiasm

3282
01:52:05,198 --> 01:52:08,238
for nfts and the financial metrics you

3283
01:52:07,599 --> 01:52:11,119
see

3284
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:13,039
the growth there in that sector is

3285
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:16,238
partially a function of where we are

3286
01:52:13,039 --> 01:52:18,560
in the actual credit cycle so

3287
01:52:16,238 --> 01:52:19,439
oftentimes when inflationary events

3288
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:21,280
occur

3289
01:52:19,439 --> 01:52:23,039
you have correspondent speculative

3290
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:24,880
manias that

3291
01:52:23,039 --> 01:52:26,479
occur at the same time because people

3292
01:52:24,880 --> 01:52:28,880
intuitively feel

3293
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:30,079
that the fiat currency that they hold is

3294
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:31,920
being debased

3295
01:52:30,079 --> 01:52:33,920
and so they frantically look around for

3296
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:38,560
other places to put it so

3297
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:41,760
stocks property commodities

3298
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:44,800
and then other asset classes

3299
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,440
nfts are an asset class and this is the

3300
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,239
case with

3301
01:52:45,439 --> 01:52:50,238
any inflation you look at in history you

3302
01:52:48,238 --> 01:52:53,839
saw these corresponds speculative

3303
01:52:50,238 --> 01:52:56,559
manias basically speculative episodes

3304
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:57,360
so a lot of us feel that inflation is

3305
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,920
occurring

3306
01:52:57,359 --> 01:53:01,519
whether it's in cpi or not the basically

3307
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:02,800
lots of dollars are being injected into

3308
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:04,719
the economy

3309
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:07,520
we've all seen stocks massively

3310
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:10,079
appreciate even as gdp contracted

3311
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:12,480
and so a lot of people sort of got

3312
01:53:10,079 --> 01:53:14,399
caught on to this notion that

3313
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:15,839
wow as the fed you know lowers interest

3314
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:17,839
rates and

3315
01:53:15,840 --> 01:53:19,520
congress spends a huge amount of

3316
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:21,039
stimulus dollars into the economy

3317
01:53:19,520 --> 01:53:23,760
financial assets going to go up so i

3318
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:26,479
better have exposure to all that stuff

3319
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:28,480
and so you see virtually every asset

3320
01:53:26,479 --> 01:53:29,359
class is awash with cash right now

3321
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:31,198
people are

3322
01:53:29,359 --> 01:53:32,799
investing like their lives depend on it

3323
01:53:31,198 --> 01:53:35,678
investing trading whatever

3324
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,639
whether it's options volumes on robin

3325
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:38,319
hood you know like

3326
01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:40,880
kind of retail brokerages things like

3327
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:42,960
that whether it's stocks

3328
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,719
whether it's crypto and then other

3329
01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:46,960
collectibles baseball cards

3330
01:53:44,719 --> 01:53:49,198
their valuations have been skyrocketing

3331
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:51,359
and so i think nfts are part of that

3332
01:53:49,198 --> 01:53:53,439
it's a new asset class it's basically an

3333
01:53:51,359 --> 01:53:57,598
opportunity to invest in sort of

3334
01:53:53,439 --> 01:53:59,039
art or collectibles in-game items things

3335
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:02,000
like that

3336
01:53:59,039 --> 01:54:02,960
i think that explains a large degree of

3337
01:54:02,000 --> 01:54:05,039
the

3338
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:08,079
enthusiasm the excitement is that it's a

3339
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:11,599
novel asset class that people can trade

3340
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:13,519
and right as you know these inflationary

3341
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:15,920
tailwinds pick up

3342
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:17,920
now as for the sort of virtues of the

3343
01:54:15,920 --> 01:54:20,880
actual technical

3344
01:54:17,920 --> 01:54:21,679
phenomenon nfts are actually not a new

3345
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:24,639
idea at all

3346
01:54:21,679 --> 01:54:25,599
so you've had nfts i didn't call them

3347
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:28,400
nfts but

3348
01:54:25,599 --> 01:54:30,159
in 2016 built on bitcoin for instance so

3349
01:54:28,399 --> 01:54:33,759
it's been around for a while

3350
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:37,439
what it is is a serial code basically

3351
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:38,639
a string of data that is inserted onto a

3352
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:41,279
public blockchain

3353
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:42,319
and then circulates as a unique token

3354
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:44,399
and then the question is

3355
01:54:42,319 --> 01:54:46,238
okay well what does that data refer to

3356
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:48,079
what's the external reference

3357
01:54:46,238 --> 01:54:50,399
and that has to be defined there has to

3358
01:54:48,079 --> 01:54:50,880
be some entity which says oh yeah this

3359
01:54:50,399 --> 01:54:53,439
unique

3360
01:54:50,880 --> 01:54:54,639
string refers to like this piece of art

3361
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:57,919
or digital content

3362
01:54:54,639 --> 01:54:59,599
or you know trading card or whatever so

3363
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:01,359
nft the concept itself is like an

3364
01:54:59,599 --> 01:55:02,880
incredibly broad idea it's just well

3365
01:55:01,359 --> 01:55:05,679
what if we took

3366
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:07,920
uh you know barcodes and put them on

3367
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:09,520
chain so that they could be traded

3368
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,199
and so they could circulate freely on a

3369
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,719
peer-to-peer basis and

3370
01:55:11,198 --> 01:55:16,079
plugged into exchanges and things like

3371
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:20,239
that so that concept is super valid

3372
01:55:16,079 --> 01:55:22,719
clearly has protocol market fit right

3373
01:55:20,238 --> 01:55:23,759
people are using it for a really wide

3374
01:55:22,719 --> 01:55:26,719
array of purposes

3375
01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:28,480
it's completely going to exist may the

3376
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:31,118
valuations contract

3377
01:55:28,479 --> 01:55:33,279
of nfts in the aggregate definitely

3378
01:55:31,118 --> 01:55:36,479
possible probably likely

3379
01:55:33,279 --> 01:55:39,840
uh but i think the notion of

3380
01:55:36,479 --> 01:55:42,559
creating enduring collectibles or

3381
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:44,000
artworks that have accompanied you know

3382
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:45,679
accompanying signatures

3383
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,920
basically autographed art on the

3384
01:55:45,679 --> 01:55:50,560
blockchain that has totally been

3385
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:54,158
validated i think that won't go away

3386
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:55,679
i wonder if there's ideas like big cloud

3387
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:57,598
for example i don't know if you saw that

3388
01:55:55,679 --> 01:55:59,279
if there's ideas built on top of this

3389
01:55:57,599 --> 01:56:01,199
concept it doesn't have to be enough

3390
01:55:59,279 --> 01:56:04,000
like ethereum an ft it could be just the

3391
01:56:01,198 --> 01:56:06,319
concept of non-fungible tokens

3392
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,679
whether those kinds of things can take

3393
01:56:06,319 --> 01:56:10,639
hold

3394
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:11,599
and they it's less about financial

3395
01:56:10,639 --> 01:56:14,960
transactions

3396
01:56:11,599 --> 01:56:18,639
and more about almost like

3397
01:56:14,960 --> 01:56:20,480
um i don't i don't know how to put it

3398
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:23,279
but

3399
01:56:20,479 --> 01:56:24,718
like staking identity in some way

3400
01:56:23,279 --> 01:56:27,439
whether it's big cloud or

3401
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:28,000
identity of objects like there might be

3402
01:56:27,439 --> 01:56:30,319
some way

3403
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:33,118
of connecting physical reality and

3404
01:56:30,319 --> 01:56:36,079
digital reality in some interesting ways

3405
01:56:33,118 --> 01:56:37,839
so just the financial aspect is a way to

3406
01:56:36,079 --> 01:56:41,198
like put

3407
01:56:37,840 --> 01:56:43,199
some validity behind the identity

3408
01:56:41,198 --> 01:56:45,198
i don't i wonder if there's like ideas

3409
01:56:43,198 --> 01:56:48,719
there that are yet to be

3410
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:51,598
discovered or ideas that

3411
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:53,520
yet to be take hold like big clout seems

3412
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:56,400
interesting yeah it seems shady as hell

3413
01:56:53,520 --> 01:56:58,560
seems a little scammy yeah i don't know

3414
01:56:56,399 --> 01:57:01,759
if i like the idea that you can

3415
01:56:58,560 --> 01:57:03,920
bet on people essentially right

3416
01:57:01,760 --> 01:57:05,280
yeah i think my market cap on big cloud

3417
01:57:03,920 --> 01:57:09,199
is like 90 000

3418
01:57:05,279 --> 01:57:09,198
and i haven't done anything there so

3419
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:13,279
uh did you take did you like take uh

3420
01:57:11,599 --> 01:57:14,880
like verify yourself or whatever

3421
01:57:13,279 --> 01:57:16,479
i have not i think people would yell at

3422
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:19,118
me on twitter if i did

3423
01:57:16,479 --> 01:57:21,198
so and it's unclear whether it's a scam

3424
01:57:19,118 --> 01:57:22,399
yet or not right it's unclear where it's

3425
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:25,759
coming from

3426
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:27,679
well there are some details about the

3427
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:29,280
you know investors it's it's backed by

3428
01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:30,719
some pretty big name investors so

3429
01:57:29,279 --> 01:57:32,559
i probably wouldn't use the word scam to

3430
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:35,118
describe it but it's got

3431
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:35,760
ponzi-like dynamics like everything in

3432
01:57:35,118 --> 01:57:38,559
crypto

3433
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:39,199
yeah so is very questionable and then

3434
01:57:38,560 --> 01:57:41,599
also is

3435
01:57:39,198 --> 01:57:42,319
using using people's likeness without

3436
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:44,159
their

3437
01:57:42,319 --> 01:57:45,679
permission which is i think a legal

3438
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:48,960
question you know so there's

3439
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:52,000
open questions around it but you know is

3440
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:53,520
are public blockchains and you know

3441
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,760
that sort of architecture is that going

3442
01:57:53,520 --> 01:57:57,840
to be useful for decentralized or

3443
01:57:55,760 --> 01:58:01,039
alternative forms of social media

3444
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:03,279
yeah a hundred percent yes you know i'm

3445
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:06,399
super super bullish on that idea

3446
01:58:03,279 --> 01:58:09,920
basically creating open protocols

3447
01:58:06,399 --> 01:58:13,439
open name spaces ways to organize

3448
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:16,239
without the dependence on a single node

3449
01:58:13,439 --> 01:58:19,279
effectively in silicon valley you know

3450
01:58:16,238 --> 01:58:21,678
the twitter node or the facebook node

3451
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:22,639
i think it's a matter of urgency that we

3452
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:24,639
create

3453
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:25,760
you know digital gathering spaces where

3454
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:27,039
you have strong

3455
01:58:25,760 --> 01:58:28,880
property rights you know you have a

3456
01:58:27,039 --> 01:58:30,479
claim on your identity you have a claim

3457
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:32,319
on your data

3458
01:58:30,479 --> 01:58:33,598
and open architecture is our way to do

3459
01:58:32,319 --> 01:58:34,719
that i don't know if it'll be a

3460
01:58:33,599 --> 01:58:38,880
blockchain

3461
01:58:34,719 --> 01:58:40,399
but certainly i think the the general

3462
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:43,359
you know concept introduced by

3463
01:58:40,399 --> 01:58:45,839
blockchains is a good template for

3464
01:58:43,359 --> 01:58:46,399
how to you know organize these systems

3465
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:49,440
yeah

3466
01:58:46,399 --> 01:58:52,559
value freedom value decentralization

3467
01:58:49,439 --> 01:58:56,079
of power whatever the mechanism

3468
01:58:52,560 --> 01:58:57,840
let me ask you about love so uh there is

3469
01:58:56,079 --> 01:59:01,279
a bitcoin maximalist

3470
01:58:57,840 --> 01:59:05,279
community that

3471
01:59:01,279 --> 01:59:07,920
sometimes so those folks in general

3472
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:09,439
have a strong belief that bitcoin is

3473
01:59:07,920 --> 01:59:13,520
good for the world

3474
01:59:09,439 --> 01:59:18,158
and it's almost an ethical imperative to

3475
01:59:13,520 --> 01:59:18,159
to sort of uh help bitcoin succeed

3476
01:59:18,479 --> 01:59:23,279
which i think is uh as a member of any

3477
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:25,520
community i think is beautiful to

3478
01:59:23,279 --> 01:59:27,759
believe in the vision of the community

3479
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:30,320
right there does seem to be some

3480
01:59:27,760 --> 01:59:33,520
properties of what

3481
01:59:30,319 --> 01:59:35,759
some may call like toxicity or derision

3482
01:59:33,520 --> 01:59:39,280
and mockery and those kinds of things

3483
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:40,560
um so you know uh some folks have

3484
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:44,079
criticized this

3485
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:46,080
right that uh bitcoin maximalism is not

3486
01:59:44,079 --> 01:59:50,079
necessarily good for the world

3487
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:51,840
even if bitcoin is good for the world

3488
01:59:50,079 --> 01:59:53,359
what are your thoughts about this kind

3489
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:56,719
of approach

3490
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:59,598
philosophically or practically to uh

3491
01:59:56,719 --> 02:00:01,279
the spread of bitcoin and is there a way

3492
01:59:59,599 --> 02:00:03,840
that we can add more

3493
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:05,439
love to the world while we add more

3494
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,840
bitcoin to the world

3495
02:00:05,439 --> 02:00:09,279
oh that's a great question i mean i you

3496
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,319
know bitcoin is sort of what you make of

3497
02:00:09,279 --> 02:00:14,158
it so

3498
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:16,238
you can define your own path as you

3499
02:00:14,158 --> 02:00:17,359
uh advocate for bitcoin or don't for

3500
02:00:16,238 --> 02:00:20,718
that matter

3501
02:00:17,359 --> 02:00:21,759
so my chosen approach is the approach

3502
02:00:20,719 --> 02:00:25,039
you see here

3503
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:26,719
which i try to minimize the amount of

3504
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:29,118
sort of harshness or mockery

3505
02:00:26,719 --> 02:00:29,920
although i've been known to be mean on

3506
02:00:29,118 --> 02:00:31,839
twitter too

3507
02:00:29,920 --> 02:00:33,520
you know what twitter is a specific

3508
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,360
sorry to interrupt there's a specific

3509
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:37,840
medium where this takes

3510
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:38,719
its worst form so i'm learning listen

3511
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,319
i'm actually

3512
02:00:38,719 --> 02:00:42,639
because of this podcast but in general

3513
02:00:40,319 --> 02:00:46,639
i'm part of different communities

3514
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:49,520
and some are full of like unabashed love

3515
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:50,000
and some more like when i experienced on

3516
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:52,960
twitter

3517
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:53,520
the bitcoin community at first i was off

3518
02:00:52,960 --> 02:00:56,319
put

3519
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:57,119
yeah in terms of the intensity the

3520
02:00:56,319 --> 02:01:02,000
mockery

3521
02:00:57,118 --> 02:01:02,000
i bet the layers of lull

3522
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:05,599
like the layers of not taking anything

3523
02:01:04,238 --> 02:01:08,399
seriously

3524
02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:10,639
and i think there's power to that

3525
02:01:08,399 --> 02:01:14,079
there's freedom to that i appreciate it

3526
02:01:10,639 --> 02:01:14,560
i have respect for it but it's not my

3527
02:01:14,079 --> 02:01:17,039
thing

3528
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:18,880
on twitter it's just not not the way i

3529
02:01:17,039 --> 02:01:21,439
enjoy communicating on twitter

3530
02:01:18,880 --> 02:01:22,719
i retired from twitter i hit i hit a

3531
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:23,359
hundred thousand followers and then i

3532
02:01:22,719 --> 02:01:25,920
retired

3533
02:01:23,359 --> 02:01:27,359
so i'm free now i don't have to tweet

3534
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:30,000
anymore it's great

3535
02:01:27,359 --> 02:01:30,719
but i i totally can see the point i wish

3536
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,198
that

3537
02:01:30,719 --> 02:01:34,158
bitcoiners were gentler in their

3538
02:01:33,198 --> 02:01:35,678
approach

3539
02:01:34,158 --> 02:01:37,839
not all bitcoiners are like that of

3540
02:01:35,679 --> 02:01:39,520
course there's you know 50 to 100

3541
02:01:37,840 --> 02:01:42,319
million of them worldwide

3542
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:43,199
and a few tens of thousands on twitter

3543
02:01:42,319 --> 02:01:44,238
so

3544
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:47,198
i'm not going to claim that they're

3545
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:48,079
necessarily representative the toxicity

3546
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:51,279
though

3547
02:01:48,079 --> 02:01:53,840
is kind of a learned habit because

3548
02:01:51,279 --> 02:01:55,118
uh bitcoin has had so many episodes

3549
02:01:53,840 --> 02:01:57,599
where

3550
02:01:55,118 --> 02:01:58,559
strong willed institutions the dice

3551
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:00,880
billionaires

3552
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:01,679
the dice were pretty toxic you could say

3553
02:02:00,880 --> 02:02:04,639
right i'm

3554
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:05,920
basically mocking critics of bitcoin but

3555
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:07,520
at the same time

3556
02:02:05,920 --> 02:02:09,599
you're saying that the criticism has

3557
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:12,560
been predictable and repeatable and all

3558
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:14,000
it's been the same throughout yeah and

3559
02:02:12,560 --> 02:02:16,480
that's a that's a pretty

3560
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,319
you know dismissive thing to say right

3561
02:02:16,479 --> 02:02:22,238
that i can reduce you to a

3562
02:02:18,319 --> 02:02:25,519
an algorithm of you know with 11 uh

3563
02:02:22,238 --> 02:02:27,519
right yeah permutations um

3564
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:29,199
but you know the thing to remember i

3565
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,800
guess is that

3566
02:02:29,198 --> 02:02:33,118
some of the best funded companies in the

3567
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,039
bitcoin space the most powerful miners

3568
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:37,920
billionaires have tried to change and

3569
02:02:35,039 --> 02:02:41,118
co-opt and alter bitcoin

3570
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:43,279
um to shape it to their liking

3571
02:02:41,118 --> 02:02:44,960
and without these incredibly hardcore

3572
02:02:43,279 --> 02:02:46,238
sort of high priests of the bitcoin

3573
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:49,439
protocol

3574
02:02:46,238 --> 02:02:51,759
it would have been hopeless hopelessly

3575
02:02:49,439 --> 02:02:54,879
malleated in all number of ways

3576
02:02:51,760 --> 02:02:57,039
and so there is a reason

3577
02:02:54,880 --> 02:02:58,000
why someone would be incredibly

3578
02:02:57,039 --> 02:03:01,359
protective

3579
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,679
of bitcoin uh does that justify

3580
02:03:01,359 --> 02:03:04,960
immense toxicity on you know on social

3581
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:08,719
media

3582
02:03:04,960 --> 02:03:10,880
probably not but it's a leaderless

3583
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:12,560
uh protocol so the whole point is that

3584
02:03:10,880 --> 02:03:14,480
it's money for enemies

3585
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:15,920
and you know some of the bitcoin

3586
02:03:14,479 --> 02:03:18,000
maximalists came for me too

3587
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:19,359
when i made suggestions that they didn't

3588
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:21,118
like um

3589
02:03:19,359 --> 02:03:22,960
but you know i'm happy to use it the

3590
02:03:21,118 --> 02:03:24,639
protocol because

3591
02:03:22,960 --> 02:03:27,760
i know that that transaction will be

3592
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:30,880
final regardless of how odious

3593
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:32,560
my counterparty is or how how you know

3594
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:33,039
politically disfavored their opinions

3595
02:03:32,560 --> 02:03:35,199
are

3596
02:03:33,039 --> 02:03:37,840
see i mean and this is where there's

3597
02:03:35,198 --> 02:03:40,399
there could be disagreements but i

3598
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:41,440
i think you have to think about what's

3599
02:03:40,399 --> 02:03:44,559
effective

3600
02:03:41,439 --> 02:03:47,759
as a defense mechanism of strong ideas

3601
02:03:44,560 --> 02:03:51,760
and i personally think that

3602
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:56,079
uh like kindness and thoughtfulness

3603
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:58,400
and like is much more effective because

3604
02:03:56,078 --> 02:04:01,118
it lets the idea shine

3605
02:03:58,399 --> 02:04:02,719
as opposed to the personality of the

3606
02:04:01,118 --> 02:04:05,598
individual humans

3607
02:04:02,719 --> 02:04:06,078
overriding it but there's debates on

3608
02:04:05,599 --> 02:04:08,960
this

3609
02:04:06,078 --> 02:04:09,519
you know i i mean i take your side on

3610
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,319
that

3611
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:13,599
i think a patient and careful approach

3612
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:15,920
is the way to go

3613
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:17,039
now do all critics deserve good faith

3614
02:04:15,920 --> 02:04:19,039
engagement right

3615
02:04:17,039 --> 02:04:21,679
no i would say a lot of critics of

3616
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:24,319
bitcoin operate an extreme bad faith

3617
02:04:21,679 --> 02:04:26,319
and the reason why is because we're not

3618
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:27,759
just talking about technical questions

3619
02:04:26,319 --> 02:04:30,238
in fact most of this conversation has

3620
02:04:27,760 --> 02:04:32,639
not been technical it's been political

3621
02:04:30,238 --> 02:04:34,158
because bitcoin is an intensely

3622
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:36,639
political idea

3623
02:04:34,158 --> 02:04:38,479
and so a lot of people are predisposed

3624
02:04:36,639 --> 02:04:40,719
to totally hate it

3625
02:04:38,479 --> 02:04:42,638
and to wish you know death on bitcoiners

3626
02:04:40,719 --> 02:04:45,198
i mean there was a professor at gw

3627
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:46,319
this i saw earlier this week that was

3628
02:04:45,198 --> 02:04:47,678
amusing about

3629
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:49,920
getting all the big corners on a boat

3630
02:04:47,679 --> 02:04:51,199
and sinking it it's like in what other

3631
02:04:49,920 --> 02:04:53,760
context would a

3632
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:54,879
you know upstanding professor muse about

3633
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:56,639
mass murder

3634
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:58,239
but in the context of bitcoin it's sort

3635
02:04:56,639 --> 02:05:02,159
of okay

3636
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:03,279
um you know within his peers because

3637
02:05:02,158 --> 02:05:04,960
you're talking about something that most

3638
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:06,800
people don't like you know it's a

3639
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:08,399
concept that's alien to them

3640
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:10,320
that doesn't jive with the way they see

3641
02:05:08,399 --> 02:05:13,839
the world and so

3642
02:05:10,319 --> 02:05:15,840
because it's so you know pitched from a

3643
02:05:13,840 --> 02:05:18,319
political perspective

3644
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:20,239
uh there's a lot of critics as well as

3645
02:05:18,319 --> 02:05:22,479
defenders that operate in bad faith

3646
02:05:20,238 --> 02:05:24,238
i would say but that's the nature of the

3647
02:05:22,479 --> 02:05:26,238
beast it's because we're proposing a

3648
02:05:24,238 --> 02:05:27,279
very disruptive thing

3649
02:05:26,238 --> 02:05:29,919
and there are people that would be

3650
02:05:27,279 --> 02:05:33,519
disrupted by it

3651
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:38,399
you wrote a blog post titled on writing

3652
02:05:33,520 --> 02:05:38,400
you're i think an excellent writer

3653
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:44,238
so let me ask what does it take to be a

3654
02:05:40,319 --> 02:05:44,238
good writer what does it take to

3655
02:05:44,399 --> 02:05:48,479
write some of the blog posts you've

3656
02:05:47,359 --> 02:05:50,559
written

3657
02:05:48,479 --> 02:05:52,319
sort of condensed set of ideas in your

3658
02:05:50,560 --> 02:05:54,400
head the mess that's probably in your

3659
02:05:52,319 --> 02:05:58,399
head and putting down on paper

3660
02:05:54,399 --> 02:06:01,519
in a way that's uh communicates the idea

3661
02:05:58,399 --> 02:06:03,359
clearly and powerfully so that was

3662
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:04,639
basically the point of the blog post is

3663
02:06:03,359 --> 02:06:06,479
that being an

3664
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:08,639
impressive writer is different from

3665
02:06:06,479 --> 02:06:11,118
being an effective writer

3666
02:06:08,639 --> 02:06:12,639
you know so i think the answer to your

3667
02:06:11,118 --> 02:06:16,479
question is humility

3668
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:18,960
basically so i think

3669
02:06:16,479 --> 02:06:20,479
if you let pride and vanity seep into

3670
02:06:18,960 --> 02:06:24,239
your writing

3671
02:06:20,479 --> 02:06:25,198
then you risk uh creating a very noisy

3672
02:06:24,238 --> 02:06:26,879
signal

3673
02:06:25,198 --> 02:06:29,839
you know creating very inefficient

3674
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:31,679
channel for communicating

3675
02:06:29,840 --> 02:06:33,360
neural arrangements from your brain to

3676
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:35,520
someone else's brain and that's what i

3677
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:38,639
think about when i write is like

3678
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:41,520
wow i have the power to at scale

3679
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:42,719
change the literal physical composition

3680
02:06:41,520 --> 02:06:45,280
of people's brains

3681
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:47,920
right to rewire them if i make an idea

3682
02:06:45,279 --> 02:06:51,599
that's so persuasive that's so sticky

3683
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:54,639
if i coin a phrase that is so pithy

3684
02:06:51,599 --> 02:06:55,279
then i can alter their brain that's

3685
02:06:54,639 --> 02:06:56,639
crazy

3686
02:06:55,279 --> 02:06:58,639
i mean you're letting someone reach into

3687
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:59,920
your head and like mess with it a little

3688
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:01,920
bit

3689
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:03,279
that's unbelievable and that's like a

3690
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:05,279
superpower and if you could do that to a

3691
02:07:03,279 --> 02:07:07,759
hundred thousand people at once

3692
02:07:05,279 --> 02:07:09,599
how powerful is that right you mentioned

3693
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:12,079
descartes i think therefore i am

3694
02:07:09,599 --> 02:07:13,440
that's like literally rewired millions

3695
02:07:12,078 --> 02:07:14,880
of brains throughout history

3696
02:07:13,439 --> 02:07:17,519
right i mean that's one of the most

3697
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:20,319
powerful like cocodo or gosam

3698
02:07:17,520 --> 02:07:21,360
one of the most powerful phrases ever

3699
02:07:20,319 --> 02:07:23,840
written

3700
02:07:21,359 --> 02:07:25,279
and that sent a zillion philosophy

3701
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:26,000
undergraduates on a rabbit hole of

3702
02:07:25,279 --> 02:07:27,439
skepticism

3703
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,840
that some of them didn't make it out of

3704
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:31,198
you know and they're convinced that

3705
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:33,599
you know with the brain in the vat

3706
02:07:31,198 --> 02:07:34,559
theory is true and there's no way to

3707
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:37,599
know

3708
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:39,840
you know what our tangible experiences

3709
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:41,199
um but yeah that so that's the beauty of

3710
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:43,599
writing

3711
02:07:41,198 --> 02:07:44,479
and um the thing that interferes with

3712
02:07:43,599 --> 02:07:47,199
that

3713
02:07:44,479 --> 02:07:48,879
is our pride our desire to you know

3714
02:07:47,198 --> 02:07:51,519
impress people and

3715
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:52,078
you know look good to them and show off

3716
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:55,599
our uh

3717
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:57,198
our vocab and stuff and that's

3718
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:58,639
that was the point of that piece is that

3719
02:07:57,198 --> 02:08:00,559
i went on this journey where i

3720
02:07:58,639 --> 02:08:01,920
eventually realized that

3721
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:03,920
i don't know if i'm any better of a

3722
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:05,840
writer for having realized it

3723
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:10,158
but i think that is a necessary

3724
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:12,159
condition so does that mean

3725
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:13,439
there is a value to striving for

3726
02:08:12,158 --> 02:08:17,039
simplicity in

3727
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:21,198
in the words as opposed to

3728
02:08:17,039 --> 02:08:23,118
i mean complexity i think so for sure

3729
02:08:21,198 --> 02:08:24,638
and we deal with complex topics all the

3730
02:08:23,118 --> 02:08:26,799
time in crypto

3731
02:08:24,639 --> 02:08:28,159
and that's always a huge red flag for me

3732
02:08:26,800 --> 02:08:29,440
i mean if you can't explain something

3733
02:08:28,158 --> 02:08:32,479
simply do you understand it

3734
02:08:29,439 --> 02:08:32,879
you know yeah so if you're talking about

3735
02:08:32,479 --> 02:08:36,319
something

3736
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:37,440
complex if you can't find simple ways to

3737
02:08:36,319 --> 02:08:39,679
discuss it

3738
02:08:37,439 --> 02:08:41,598
my presumption is that you're actually

3739
02:08:39,679 --> 02:08:43,679
obfuscating the truth

3740
02:08:41,599 --> 02:08:45,360
and this is what orwell railed against

3741
02:08:43,679 --> 02:08:46,800
with political language

3742
02:08:45,359 --> 02:08:49,519
you know he really hated political

3743
02:08:46,800 --> 02:08:51,440
language because he felt that

3744
02:08:49,520 --> 02:08:53,040
its authors were using deliberate

3745
02:08:51,439 --> 02:08:55,519
obfuscation

3746
02:08:53,039 --> 02:08:57,599
uh and you know he hated euphemisms and

3747
02:08:55,520 --> 02:09:00,480
i hate euphemisms too

3748
02:08:57,599 --> 02:09:02,719
you know i i much prefer you know

3749
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:05,359
forthrightness and clarity of thought

3750
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:06,560
but most people when they write don't

3751
02:09:05,359 --> 02:09:09,519
really endeavor

3752
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:10,400
to be particularly clear they might be

3753
02:09:09,520 --> 02:09:13,760
writing

3754
02:09:10,399 --> 02:09:15,039
to show off their startup or you know to

3755
02:09:13,760 --> 02:09:18,719
demonstrate to people

3756
02:09:15,039 --> 02:09:19,439
how cool they are or how well red they

3757
02:09:18,719 --> 02:09:21,599
are

3758
02:09:19,439 --> 02:09:24,078
you know they're displaying it's like a

3759
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:25,760
peacock style display

3760
02:09:24,078 --> 02:09:27,759
what fraction of people write to

3761
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:30,880
actually communicate meaning

3762
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:31,760
small fraction it's especially difficult

3763
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:35,039
because

3764
02:09:31,760 --> 02:09:37,280
what i've detected is something in us

3765
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:39,519
humans as readers

3766
02:09:37,279 --> 02:09:42,078
assign more credibility to people that

3767
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:45,599
obfuscate

3768
02:09:42,078 --> 02:09:47,840
so like simple clear communication of an

3769
02:09:45,599 --> 02:09:47,840
idea

3770
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:54,399
is not like the immediate reaction

3771
02:09:52,399 --> 02:09:56,559
uh is is not one where we assign

3772
02:09:54,399 --> 02:09:59,759
credibility to the person like

3773
02:09:56,560 --> 02:10:01,599
like that was uh that was brilliant

3774
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:03,520
there's a lot of people that i kind of

3775
02:10:01,599 --> 02:10:05,679
listen to without really understanding

3776
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:08,320
what the heck they're talking about

3777
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:08,719
and but it sounds musical and smart and

3778
02:10:08,319 --> 02:10:11,439
then

3779
02:10:08,719 --> 02:10:13,679
i see a lot of folks assigning

3780
02:10:11,439 --> 02:10:16,960
credibility to that person

3781
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:19,039
and it's unfortunate

3782
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:20,480
uh it's unfortunate that there's that

3783
02:10:19,039 --> 02:10:23,279
tension as a reader

3784
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:25,279
that we appreciate the be the beauty and

3785
02:10:23,279 --> 02:10:30,158
power of like

3786
02:10:25,279 --> 02:10:33,279
complex weaving of words

3787
02:10:30,158 --> 02:10:35,679
without assigning as much uh

3788
02:10:33,279 --> 02:10:37,599
value to like actual clear communication

3789
02:10:35,679 --> 02:10:39,599
of an idea

3790
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:40,960
and i'm almost skeptical in speech as

3791
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:43,279
well when someone

3792
02:10:40,960 --> 02:10:44,078
will describe someone as articulate i'm

3793
02:10:43,279 --> 02:10:46,158
always

3794
02:10:44,078 --> 02:10:48,319
immediately skeptical of the valley of

3795
02:10:46,158 --> 02:10:50,719
what that person is saying

3796
02:10:48,319 --> 02:10:53,039
uh because if you articulate you can

3797
02:10:50,719 --> 02:10:54,078
make bad ideas sound very acceptable and

3798
02:10:53,039 --> 02:10:58,000
great

3799
02:10:54,078 --> 02:11:00,559
and norm chomskis has said this before

3800
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,760
he uh as a way to defend the way he

3801
02:11:00,560 --> 02:11:04,400
speaks

3802
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:06,000
he said that like he's suspicious of

3803
02:11:04,399 --> 02:11:08,078
charismatic people because they can

3804
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:10,158
basically sell any kind of idea

3805
02:11:08,078 --> 02:11:11,679
he speaks in a very monotone and boring

3806
02:11:10,158 --> 02:11:13,279
way so that

3807
02:11:11,679 --> 02:11:16,000
whatever the value his ideas have

3808
02:11:13,279 --> 02:11:17,198
they'll it'll shine through

3809
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,800
there's something to that there's

3810
02:11:17,198 --> 02:11:20,719
something to i love that but it's a

3811
02:11:18,800 --> 02:11:22,639
difficult journey it's a difficult path

3812
02:11:20,719 --> 02:11:24,639
because then i i think it's the right

3813
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:26,480
path because ultimately you focus on the

3814
02:11:24,639 --> 02:11:28,319
quality of your ideas and in the long

3815
02:11:26,479 --> 02:11:32,319
term that wins

3816
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:34,000
i agree just by way of advice

3817
02:11:32,319 --> 02:11:35,599
is is there if people are interested in

3818
02:11:34,000 --> 02:11:38,560
bitcoin or cryptocurrency

3819
02:11:35,599 --> 02:11:40,719
in your work what are good uh books or

3820
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:42,639
resources on bitcoin

3821
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:43,840
now from you and from others that you

3822
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:46,159
can recommend that

3823
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:47,760
in your own journey helped you or you've

3824
02:11:46,158 --> 02:11:51,118
seen help others

3825
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:51,679
well it's very easy or it's much easier

3826
02:11:51,118 --> 02:11:53,839
today

3827
02:11:51,679 --> 02:11:55,279
to make the bitcoin journey because the

3828
02:11:53,840 --> 02:11:57,599
quality of content is so much better

3829
02:11:55,279 --> 02:11:59,679
than it was when i started i mean

3830
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:00,880
when i learned about bitcoin there was

3831
02:11:59,679 --> 02:12:03,039
the bitcoin wiki

3832
02:12:00,880 --> 02:12:05,520
and the bitcoin stack exchange and the

3833
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:08,078
subreddit and that was kind of it

3834
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:09,760
and you had to just pick up everything

3835
02:12:08,078 --> 02:12:11,279
the economic theory hadn't really been

3836
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,599
worked out very much

3837
02:12:11,279 --> 02:12:15,279
so you'd pick everything up from scratch

3838
02:12:13,599 --> 02:12:16,078
the good news is that there's a huge

3839
02:12:15,279 --> 02:12:17,840
abundance

3840
02:12:16,078 --> 02:12:19,679
of content and that's actually one of

3841
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:21,199
bitcoin's greatest strengths

3842
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:23,359
is that people are totally inspired to

3843
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:25,118
write about it and

3844
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:26,479
it's almost a rite of passage at this

3845
02:12:25,118 --> 02:12:29,519
point if you're like

3846
02:12:26,479 --> 02:12:30,879
a bitcoin thinker to have your book i

3847
02:12:29,520 --> 02:12:32,880
don't have a book yet i would love to

3848
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:34,480
recommend my book i haven't written one

3849
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:37,359
are you thinking about writing a book

3850
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:38,959
yeah i think it's my duty 100

3851
02:12:37,359 --> 02:12:40,639
everyone that has created a lot of bit

3852
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:42,319
of bitcoin content probably should

3853
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:45,440
condense it into a book

3854
02:12:42,319 --> 02:12:47,920
to give it an enduring status it's

3855
02:12:45,439 --> 02:12:50,238
interesting because you mentioned uh

3856
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:51,599
block size wars

3857
02:12:50,238 --> 02:12:54,559
and you've written on a lot of different

3858
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:58,000
topics so you could both write

3859
02:12:54,560 --> 02:13:00,480
a like a big like sapien

3860
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:02,158
style book about bitcoin or

3861
02:13:00,479 --> 02:13:04,959
cryptocurrency right

3862
02:13:02,158 --> 02:13:06,559
but you can also write a book on each

3863
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:09,439
like a specific

3864
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:09,920
thing and now that you put pressure on

3865
02:13:09,439 --> 02:13:12,559
yourself

3866
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:13,039
and talk talk about simplicity right

3867
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:15,119
yeah

3868
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:17,359
where do you lean on those different

3869
02:13:15,118 --> 02:13:20,479
book journeys that you might take on

3870
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:23,598
like do you have a new uh

3871
02:13:20,479 --> 02:13:25,359
eventually like a like a bitcoin book

3872
02:13:23,599 --> 02:13:26,639
i mean i tallied up the words that i

3873
02:13:25,359 --> 02:13:28,078
wrote in the last couple years on

3874
02:13:26,639 --> 02:13:29,760
bitcoin it's like over a hundred

3875
02:13:28,078 --> 02:13:32,799
thousand words a year

3876
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:36,000
so that's two novels there um

3877
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:36,599
but yeah i think i do um i think there's

3878
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:40,158
so much

3879
02:13:36,599 --> 02:13:42,000
underexplored space in bitcoin i mean

3880
02:13:40,158 --> 02:13:43,198
uh a systematic interpretation of

3881
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,359
satoshi's writings

3882
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:47,198
for instance and a lot of people don't

3883
02:13:45,359 --> 02:13:48,479
want anyone to do that because they

3884
02:13:47,198 --> 02:13:50,879
don't want it to have these religious

3885
02:13:48,479 --> 02:13:54,000
overtones where you're engaging in

3886
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:56,000
interpretation you know but

3887
02:13:54,000 --> 02:13:58,078
that's you know something that should be

3888
02:13:56,000 --> 02:14:00,158
done there's a lot of bitcoin histories

3889
02:13:58,078 --> 02:14:01,759
that haven't been written

3890
02:14:00,158 --> 02:14:03,439
there was a great bitcoin history

3891
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:04,560
recently published that's this is one of

3892
02:14:03,439 --> 02:14:08,078
my recommendations

3893
02:14:04,560 --> 02:14:09,360
is on the block size war by jonathan

3894
02:14:08,078 --> 02:14:11,279
beer

3895
02:14:09,359 --> 02:14:13,198
who runs probably the best research desk

3896
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:16,960
in the industry

3897
02:14:13,198 --> 02:14:18,078
so there's huge amounts of history that

3898
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:20,719
has transpired

3899
02:14:18,078 --> 02:14:21,599
that hasn't been chronicled and some of

3900
02:14:20,719 --> 02:14:24,158
the accounts

3901
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:24,840
are indifferent you know they're often

3902
02:14:24,158 --> 02:14:27,920
written by

3903
02:14:24,840 --> 02:14:30,159
outsiders you know journalists that

3904
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:31,679
maybe don't fully engage with the

3905
02:14:30,158 --> 02:14:33,439
bitcoin system

3906
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:34,960
but do you think the humans are

3907
02:14:33,439 --> 02:14:36,719
interesting in the story too

3908
02:14:34,960 --> 02:14:38,800
of course they're the most interesting

3909
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:40,239
thing you know i mean bitcoin itself

3910
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:43,440
doesn't really change that much

3911
02:14:40,238 --> 02:14:45,039
it's kind of this cold you know protocol

3912
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:47,359
that just sort of takes along but the

3913
02:14:45,039 --> 02:14:49,118
characters are just fascinating i mean

3914
02:14:47,359 --> 02:14:50,719
and there's so many unbelievable

3915
02:14:49,118 --> 02:14:53,359
characters in the bitcoin story

3916
02:14:50,719 --> 02:14:54,719
unbelievable yeah that's the cool thing

3917
02:14:53,359 --> 02:14:57,118
about bitcoin

3918
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:57,760
and uh cryptocurrency and just internet

3919
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:01,439
is like

3920
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:04,159
the weirdos the brilliant weirdos like

3921
02:15:01,439 --> 02:15:06,158
all the people in uh in the stuff that's

3922
02:15:04,158 --> 02:15:08,238
already established are boring

3923
02:15:06,158 --> 02:15:10,719
like economics professors are all boring

3924
02:15:08,238 --> 02:15:11,759
right but the interesting people the

3925
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:14,158
wild ones

3926
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:16,159
are are the ones that are innovating on

3927
02:15:14,158 --> 02:15:18,000
in the crypto space which

3928
02:15:16,158 --> 02:15:19,679
uh is you know that's where the

3929
02:15:18,000 --> 02:15:22,000
dangerous weirdos are

3930
02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:24,000
and the exciting brilliant weirdos well

3931
02:15:22,000 --> 02:15:24,800
you had to be kind of crazy to adopt

3932
02:15:24,000 --> 02:15:26,399
bitcoin in

3933
02:15:24,800 --> 02:15:27,840
in the first sort of five years of its

3934
02:15:26,399 --> 02:15:30,238
life so

3935
02:15:27,840 --> 02:15:31,520
there's a adverse selection element

3936
02:15:30,238 --> 02:15:34,238
there i don't know if that's an

3937
02:15:31,520 --> 02:15:36,079
uncharitable way to put it but

3938
02:15:34,238 --> 02:15:38,158
like some of bitcoin's earliest

3939
02:15:36,078 --> 02:15:39,359
evangelists are not the evangelists i

3940
02:15:38,158 --> 02:15:41,279
would have chosen

3941
02:15:39,359 --> 02:15:44,000
yeah but they were the ones that we got

3942
02:15:41,279 --> 02:15:45,198
so it's one we got but is there uh is

3943
02:15:44,000 --> 02:15:47,359
there resources

3944
02:15:45,198 --> 02:15:48,719
you're basically saying just throw a

3945
02:15:47,359 --> 02:15:51,118
dart

3946
02:15:48,719 --> 02:15:52,480
and uh most books are going to be good

3947
02:15:51,118 --> 02:15:54,399
or is there something that stands out to

3948
02:15:52,479 --> 02:15:55,759
you i mean your average book is you know

3949
02:15:54,399 --> 02:15:58,399
terrible for sure but

3950
02:15:55,760 --> 02:16:00,159
uh not on bitcoin specifically but just

3951
02:15:58,399 --> 02:16:02,000
in general um

3952
02:16:00,158 --> 02:16:03,679
it depends whether you like the computer

3953
02:16:02,000 --> 02:16:06,399
science the economics

3954
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:07,760
or the history but my recommendations

3955
02:16:06,399 --> 02:16:09,039
would be

3956
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:10,880
you know obviously the bitcoin white

3957
02:16:09,039 --> 02:16:13,760
paper that's uh and

3958
02:16:10,880 --> 02:16:14,560
satoshi's complimentary writings that's

3959
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:16,400
very important

3960
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:18,960
is to try to understand the intentions

3961
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:19,679
behind the system and also to understand

3962
02:16:18,960 --> 02:16:22,319
the system

3963
02:16:19,679 --> 02:16:23,359
without having your view colored by some

3964
02:16:22,319 --> 02:16:25,359
third parties

3965
02:16:23,359 --> 02:16:27,359
description of it most descriptions of

3966
02:16:25,359 --> 02:16:29,519
bitcoin are really bad

3967
02:16:27,359 --> 02:16:30,719
uh so the just go to the originals go to

3968
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:33,280
the hal finis

3969
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:35,120
post satoshi's post on bitcoin talk

3970
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:38,000
there's a huge amount of lucidity there

3971
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:39,679
and actually most of our questions about

3972
02:16:38,000 --> 02:16:41,280
bitcoin today that we have a decade

3973
02:16:39,679 --> 02:16:42,398
later were really answered in those

3974
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:45,920
earliest days

3975
02:16:42,398 --> 02:16:47,760
people just don't know it the canonical

3976
02:16:45,920 --> 02:16:50,398
economic

3977
02:16:47,760 --> 02:16:51,120
work relating to bitcoin a lot of people

3978
02:16:50,398 --> 02:16:52,959
don't like it

3979
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:54,960
i think it's fine would be uh the

3980
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:56,239
bitcoin standard

3981
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:57,919
a lot of people don't like it i just

3982
02:16:56,239 --> 02:16:58,558
read it it's good yeah i like it i think

3983
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:00,879
it's it's

3984
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:02,159
a good uh description of sort of the

3985
02:17:00,879 --> 02:17:04,398
austrian perspective

3986
02:17:02,159 --> 02:17:06,000
and then how it relates to bitcoin there

3987
02:17:04,398 --> 02:17:07,358
isn't that much about bitcoin in there

3988
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:09,359
but i think the point is

3989
02:17:07,359 --> 02:17:10,479
once you've understood you know

3990
02:17:09,359 --> 02:17:12,880
safedeen's view

3991
02:17:10,478 --> 02:17:14,079
of monetary policy bitcoin makes a ton

3992
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:16,000
of sense so you don't actually need to

3993
02:17:14,079 --> 02:17:18,718
argue for it that much

3994
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:20,718
so the bitcoin standard is a good

3995
02:17:18,718 --> 02:17:21,119
introduction to sort of the orthodox

3996
02:17:20,718 --> 02:17:25,358
thought

3997
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:27,760
in bitcoin um there's a more recent

3998
02:17:25,359 --> 02:17:29,679
book called layered money which i liked

3999
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:32,079
um by nick battia

4000
02:17:29,679 --> 02:17:32,960
which goes into more depth about what i

4001
02:17:32,079 --> 02:17:34,638
was talking about earlier in the

4002
02:17:32,959 --> 02:17:36,799
conversation the layout approach

4003
02:17:34,638 --> 02:17:38,478
to scaling and that's a really critical

4004
02:17:36,799 --> 02:17:41,039
thing to understand

4005
02:17:38,478 --> 02:17:43,438
then technical books about bitcoin i

4006
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:45,040
like grocking bitcoin

4007
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:46,639
uh which is a very computer

4008
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:49,840
science-heavy one

4009
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:52,478
there's a good textbook um called uh

4010
02:17:49,840 --> 02:17:56,159
bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies

4011
02:17:52,478 --> 02:17:59,438
um by arvind naranian

4012
02:17:56,159 --> 02:18:00,959
i think he's um a princeton um

4013
02:17:59,439 --> 02:18:03,439
computer science professor which is

4014
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:06,000
really good at building intuition

4015
02:18:03,439 --> 02:18:06,639
um antonopoulos's books uh mastering

4016
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:10,239
bitcoin

4017
02:18:06,638 --> 02:18:11,759
are good then there's like simpler

4018
02:18:10,239 --> 02:18:13,280
intuition building books that aren't

4019
02:18:11,760 --> 02:18:14,800
hardcore on the economics or the

4020
02:18:13,280 --> 02:18:16,800
protocol design

4021
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:18,478
so you have like inventing bitcoin by

4022
02:18:16,799 --> 02:18:21,199
john pritzker which is good you have

4023
02:18:18,478 --> 02:18:22,718
bitcoin clarity by qr bickers

4024
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:25,519
as you can tell i have like a my

4025
02:18:22,718 --> 02:18:27,039
bookshelf is like mostly bitcoin books

4026
02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:28,719
okay well that's a good selection and of

4027
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,800
course like you said your

4028
02:18:28,718 --> 02:18:32,079
your writing and your book that comes

4029
02:18:30,799 --> 02:18:34,478
out

4030
02:18:32,079 --> 02:18:35,679
this year or next year next year i think

4031
02:18:34,478 --> 02:18:38,638
i'm gonna need 18 months

4032
02:18:35,679 --> 02:18:40,159
okay uh but you know they're most of the

4033
02:18:38,638 --> 02:18:43,839
good bitcoin content is just

4034
02:18:40,159 --> 02:18:47,519
online on medium on twitter so

4035
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:50,719
um it's it's a decentralized you know

4036
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:52,800
consensus kind of thing what about

4037
02:18:50,718 --> 02:18:54,318
the book recommendations that you could

4038
02:18:52,799 --> 02:18:56,718
give people love these

4039
02:18:54,318 --> 02:18:58,638
outside of the world of uh crypto that

4040
02:18:56,718 --> 02:19:01,598
maybe had an impact on your life

4041
02:18:58,638 --> 02:19:03,039
fiction like sci-fi maybe technical

4042
02:19:01,599 --> 02:19:04,478
philosophical

4043
02:19:03,040 --> 02:19:06,960
is there something you recommend that

4044
02:19:04,478 --> 02:19:08,959
people might read i really liked the

4045
02:19:06,959 --> 02:19:11,678
three body problem but that's a really

4046
02:19:08,959 --> 02:19:14,239
hackneyed recommendation but it really

4047
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:16,478
made me think and i like the hard sci-fi

4048
02:19:14,239 --> 02:19:17,920
you know the commitment to science and

4049
02:19:16,478 --> 02:19:19,920
science fiction

4050
02:19:17,920 --> 02:19:21,519
so i thought it was very clever is there

4051
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:22,960
one uh is there something that really

4052
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:25,200
annoys you

4053
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:27,039
in terms of the opposite of hard sci-fi

4054
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:30,079
like that doesn't get stuff right

4055
02:19:27,040 --> 02:19:33,040
movies or um

4056
02:19:30,079 --> 02:19:34,799
i mean i have issues when i watch like

4057
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:37,280
ostensibly sci-fi

4058
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:37,920
or fantasy films that are not consistent

4059
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:39,920
about this

4060
02:19:37,920 --> 02:19:41,359
the rules for the universe that they've

4061
02:19:39,920 --> 02:19:43,120
laid out

4062
02:19:41,359 --> 02:19:45,120
or where they're just impossible to

4063
02:19:43,120 --> 02:19:47,920
comprehend like um

4064
02:19:45,120 --> 02:19:48,399
uh christopher nolan's latest film oh

4065
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:49,840
yeah

4066
02:19:48,398 --> 02:19:51,519
you needed like a spreadsheet to

4067
02:19:49,840 --> 02:19:53,439
understand that yeah

4068
02:19:51,520 --> 02:19:54,800
yeah i trust that maybe he was

4069
02:19:53,439 --> 02:19:56,079
consistent about the rules of his

4070
02:19:54,799 --> 02:19:58,799
universe i just did not

4071
02:19:56,079 --> 02:19:59,120
understand it yeah at all in that sense

4072
02:19:58,799 --> 02:20:01,279
i

4073
02:19:59,120 --> 02:20:03,840
i really probably one of my favorites is

4074
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:07,280
the 2001 space odyssey

4075
02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:09,200
it's a it's so obviously it's many many

4076
02:20:07,280 --> 02:20:12,159
decades ago but

4077
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:14,079
it's quite brilliant in both its

4078
02:20:12,159 --> 02:20:17,280
consistency

4079
02:20:14,079 --> 02:20:20,000
and the depth of thought put

4080
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:21,760
into like what the technology would

4081
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:25,040
actually be

4082
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:28,960
uh not in like visually not

4083
02:20:25,040 --> 02:20:32,160
in kind of silly graphical ways

4084
02:20:28,959 --> 02:20:34,639
but in um

4085
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:36,318
in terms of function and its impact on

4086
02:20:34,639 --> 02:20:39,439
humanity

4087
02:20:36,318 --> 02:20:41,359
so right but that takes care that takes

4088
02:20:39,439 --> 02:20:44,000
that takes a lot of work and that takes

4089
02:20:41,359 --> 02:20:48,079
genius actually which is why kubrick is

4090
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,079
regarded for what he is

4091
02:20:48,398 --> 02:20:52,639
what advice you've taken an interesting

4092
02:20:50,879 --> 02:20:54,959
journey through your life

4093
02:20:52,639 --> 02:20:56,879
uh you've you worried fidelity your

4094
02:20:54,959 --> 02:21:00,318
philosophy major

4095
02:20:56,879 --> 02:21:02,000
uh you're now uh one of the seminal

4096
02:21:00,318 --> 02:21:03,840
minds in the world of bitcoin and

4097
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,680
cryptocurrency

4098
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:08,079
who the hell knows what the next five

4099
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:10,239
ten years looks for you

4100
02:21:08,079 --> 02:21:13,039
if you were to give advice to somebody

4101
02:21:10,239 --> 02:21:14,719
uh young today

4102
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:16,399
uh you know making their way through

4103
02:21:14,719 --> 02:21:18,079
life making a career

4104
02:21:16,398 --> 02:21:19,599
what would you what kind of advice would

4105
02:21:18,079 --> 02:21:22,719
you give

4106
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:25,120
see the problem with advice is that in a

4107
02:21:22,719 --> 02:21:25,760
world where so much of success is

4108
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:28,960
defined by

4109
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:31,359
luck and serendipity is that

4110
02:21:28,959 --> 02:21:33,039
the advice givers often don't know why

4111
02:21:31,359 --> 02:21:35,200
they've been successful

4112
02:21:33,040 --> 02:21:37,120
right and so yeah they might say you

4113
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:39,520
know i was wearing a green tie

4114
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:41,359
on the day of my job interview and so

4115
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:43,280
you should go out and wear green ties

4116
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:44,640
and so they might just get the causality

4117
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:47,359
completely wrong

4118
02:21:44,639 --> 02:21:47,920
right i mean i'm not gonna claim that

4119
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:51,760
i'm

4120
02:21:47,920 --> 02:21:53,439
super successfully at it but um

4121
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:55,040
see that's the problem is that i don't

4122
02:21:53,439 --> 02:21:56,720
think my journey is replicable

4123
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:59,680
necessarily so

4124
02:21:56,719 --> 02:22:01,039
um you know who am i to give advice

4125
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:04,159
although the one thing i will say

4126
02:22:01,040 --> 02:22:07,359
is that the thing i did right

4127
02:22:04,159 --> 02:22:10,639
was to become completely obsessed

4128
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:11,760
with um a domain i found really

4129
02:22:10,639 --> 02:22:13,680
interesting

4130
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:15,040
and held promise like if i had been

4131
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:15,680
really interested in like magic the

4132
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:17,439
gathering

4133
02:22:15,680 --> 02:22:19,520
i wouldn't have been able to like do

4134
02:22:17,439 --> 02:22:20,159
much with that aside from build like a

4135
02:22:19,520 --> 02:22:23,280
killer

4136
02:22:20,159 --> 02:22:27,039
you know card pack or whatever um

4137
02:22:23,280 --> 02:22:29,920
and i wasn't afraid to

4138
02:22:27,040 --> 02:22:30,560
you know really put myself out there um

4139
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:32,239
and

4140
02:22:30,559 --> 02:22:34,239
you know float my thoughts online and

4141
02:22:32,239 --> 02:22:35,680
see how people reacted to them even if

4142
02:22:34,239 --> 02:22:37,600
i said stuff that was completely

4143
02:22:35,680 --> 02:22:39,920
erroneous or wrong all the time

4144
02:22:37,600 --> 02:22:41,760
the rewards to writing and just

4145
02:22:39,920 --> 02:22:44,719
publishing content are immense

4146
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:46,478
as you know obviously it's the most high

4147
02:22:44,719 --> 02:22:49,039
leverage activity i think most young

4148
02:22:46,478 --> 02:22:52,318
people have available to them

4149
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:55,520
um and i was very lucky

4150
02:22:52,318 --> 02:22:57,600
and i benefited from a lot of favorable

4151
02:22:55,520 --> 02:22:59,280
coincidences a lot of people that took a

4152
02:22:57,600 --> 02:23:01,520
chance on me

4153
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:03,040
um and if i had more time i would sit

4154
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:05,760
here and name them

4155
02:23:03,040 --> 02:23:06,800
but is there something you in your

4156
02:23:05,760 --> 02:23:10,000
actions that

4157
02:23:06,799 --> 02:23:12,478
made you more open to the uh the

4158
02:23:10,000 --> 02:23:14,719
benefits of luck

4159
02:23:12,478 --> 02:23:16,639
sort of uh you know luck can bring you a

4160
02:23:14,719 --> 02:23:19,119
lot of positive and negative things

4161
02:23:16,639 --> 02:23:19,760
so saying you're lucky means you were

4162
02:23:19,120 --> 02:23:21,760
able to

4163
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:23,040
ride the wave of whatever positive stuff

4164
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:24,719
luck bring brought you

4165
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:26,479
well that's right you have to put

4166
02:23:24,719 --> 02:23:28,639
yourself in a position to be lucky

4167
02:23:26,478 --> 02:23:31,840
and most people don't so you just have

4168
02:23:28,639 --> 02:23:34,559
to get as many shots on goal as

4169
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:36,478
and of course luck is plays an

4170
02:23:34,559 --> 02:23:40,079
undeniable role in any career path

4171
02:23:36,478 --> 02:23:43,358
for sure but you do have to

4172
02:23:40,079 --> 02:23:47,280
make yourself available to it

4173
02:23:43,359 --> 02:23:50,318
and you have to take a ton of chances um

4174
02:23:47,280 --> 02:23:53,040
but yeah that's the problem with advice

4175
02:23:50,318 --> 02:23:56,559
it's just so hard to replicate it so i i

4176
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:56,560
find it illegitimate most of the time

4177
02:23:57,280 --> 02:24:01,680
uh you heard it here kids don't listen

4178
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:03,760
to anything nick just said

4179
02:24:01,680 --> 02:24:05,840
exactly wear a green tie to your

4180
02:24:03,760 --> 02:24:08,318
interviews it'll work out well

4181
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:09,520
uh do you think there's a meaning or

4182
02:24:08,318 --> 02:24:12,879
reason to any of this

4183
02:24:09,520 --> 02:24:14,079
this existence this life well we we make

4184
02:24:12,879 --> 02:24:16,639
our own meaning

4185
02:24:14,079 --> 02:24:18,079
for sure i find a huge amount of meaning

4186
02:24:16,639 --> 02:24:22,559
in what i do

4187
02:24:18,079 --> 02:24:24,799
um i find it beautiful i feel very lucky

4188
02:24:22,559 --> 02:24:25,680
and blessed to be in the line of work

4189
02:24:24,799 --> 02:24:27,759
that i'm in

4190
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:29,359
uh you know to have your hobby and your

4191
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:31,760
passion and your job just be a

4192
02:24:29,359 --> 02:24:34,239
completely integrated thing

4193
02:24:31,760 --> 02:24:35,840
so that's where i find meaning but

4194
02:24:34,239 --> 02:24:40,159
you're just a bag of like

4195
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:43,600
cells and bacteria that eventually

4196
02:24:40,159 --> 02:24:44,639
dissipates dies and it goes into the

4197
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:47,920
ground

4198
02:24:44,639 --> 02:24:50,318
and disappears back into the universe

4199
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:51,600
i mean that doesn't make any sense well

4200
02:24:50,318 --> 02:24:54,719
that may be true but

4201
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:56,000
uh i find the sublime in things like

4202
02:24:54,719 --> 02:24:58,000
bitcoin i find it

4203
02:24:56,000 --> 02:24:59,359
incredibly inspiring to work on it i

4204
02:24:58,000 --> 02:25:02,559
believe it's a 100 year

4205
02:24:59,359 --> 02:25:04,399
plus project and uh you know it stirs

4206
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:07,359
those aesthetic

4207
02:25:04,398 --> 02:25:07,760
emotions in you as i'm sure your work

4208
02:25:07,359 --> 02:25:10,399
does

4209
02:25:07,760 --> 02:25:11,359
so you find it beautiful absolutely

4210
02:25:10,398 --> 02:25:13,119
absolutely

4211
02:25:11,359 --> 02:25:15,040
and and inspiring more than just

4212
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:16,000
beautiful so you have hope for human

4213
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:18,240
civilization

4214
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:19,760
and bitcoin is part of that hope yeah

4215
02:25:18,239 --> 02:25:22,318
it's a very optimistic view

4216
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:24,000
and people accuse us of being pessimists

4217
02:25:22,318 --> 02:25:25,680
and saying that we are you know rooting

4218
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:27,280
for the collapse of civilization

4219
02:25:25,680 --> 02:25:30,720
completely false

4220
02:25:27,280 --> 02:25:31,680
um bitcoiners are compl are wildly

4221
02:25:30,719 --> 02:25:32,719
optimistic

4222
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:34,398
because they believe that you can

4223
02:25:32,719 --> 02:25:35,519
monetize a completely new system from

4224
02:25:34,398 --> 02:25:37,680
scratch

4225
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:39,680
and compete with the strongest

4226
02:25:37,680 --> 02:25:40,318
superpower in the military in the dollar

4227
02:25:39,680 --> 02:25:42,720
and

4228
02:25:40,318 --> 02:25:43,680
everything that goes with that that's

4229
02:25:42,719 --> 02:25:45,840
the craziest

4230
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:47,680
most ludicrously optimistic proposition

4231
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:49,760
imaginable

4232
02:25:47,680 --> 02:25:52,880
so i think bitcoiners are the most

4233
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:54,478
optimistic people out there

4234
02:25:52,879 --> 02:25:57,199
i don't think there's a better way to

4235
02:25:54,478 --> 02:26:00,079
end it on that hopeful

4236
02:25:57,200 --> 02:26:02,399
vision of human civilization nick i've

4237
02:26:00,079 --> 02:26:05,439

inspiring brilliant thank you so much

4243

to the information athletic greens

for sigmatic and blinkist check them out

4251
02:26:30,079 --> 02:26:32,959
in the description to support this

4252
02:26:31,680 --> 02:26:35,040
podcast

4253
02:26:32,959 --> 02:26:36,879
and now let me leave you with some words

4254
02:26:35,040 --> 02:26:39,600
about freedom and beauty

4255
02:26:36,879 --> 02:26:40,879
from stephen king some birds are not

4256
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:43,920
meant to be caged

4257
02:26:40,879 --> 02:26:46,959
that's all their feathers are too bright

4258
02:26:43,920 --> 02:26:48,079
their songs too sweet and wild so you

4259
02:26:46,959 --> 02:26:49,839
let them go

4260
02:26:48,079 --> 02:26:52,000
and when you open the cage to feed them

4261
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:53,600
they somehow fly out past you

4262
02:26:52,000 --> 02:26:54,959
and the part of you that knows it was

4263
02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:56,559
wrong to imprison them in the first

4264
02:26:54,959 --> 02:26:59,039
place rejoices

4265
02:26:56,559 --> 02:27:00,318
but still the place where you live is

4266
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:03,520
that much more drab

4267
02:27:00,318 --> 02:27:05,039
and empty for their departure thank you

4268
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:16,319
for listening and hope to see you

4269
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:16,319
next time
