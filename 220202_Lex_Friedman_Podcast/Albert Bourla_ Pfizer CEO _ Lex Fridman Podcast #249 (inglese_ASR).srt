1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,879
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,278
albert berla ceo of pfizer if you would

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:09,759
like to skip ahead to our conversation

4
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:10,960
the timestamps as always are below

5
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,279
but if not

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:15,440
please allow me to say a few words about

7
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,600
truth and human nature

8
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,439
specifically about two groups of people

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,760
throughout history that seek to lay

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,079
claim to the truth

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
the first group will tell you that only

12
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,000
they possess the truth and that the

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,599
government will save you the company

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,439
will save you the science the

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,719
authorities the experts the institutions

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,200
will save you

17
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,600
the second group too will tell you that

18
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,520
only they possess the truth that the

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,039
government will hurt you the company

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,879
will hurt you the science the

21
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,558
authorities the experts the institutions

22
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:46,960
will hurt you

23
00:00:44,558 --> 00:00:49,439
both groups have the benevolent and the

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,799
malevolent their heroes and their

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:54,640
charlatans and i think the hard truth

26
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,558
is that no one in this world can tell

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,600
you with absolute certainty which is

28
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,519
which

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,239
you have to use your mind

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,680
this is the burden of being human of

31
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,319
being free

32
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:08,879
don't blindly follow any leader neither

33
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,279
the emperor nor the martyr who points

34
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,640
out that the emperor has no clothes

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,439
and then there's the lessons of history

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,599
vaccines have saved hundreds of millions

37
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,438
of lives in the past century and in

38
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:23,919
general the advance of medicine has

39
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:26,000
saved billions of lives if you ignore

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,240
the power of science you're not being

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,118
honest with the lessons of history

42
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:30,640
and

43
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,959
if you ignore the corrupting nature of

44
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
power and money within institutions

45
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:37,280
including governments and companies

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,680
that led to the suffering and death of

47
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,680
hundreds of millions in the past century

48
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,360
you are once again

49
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,880
not being honest with the lessons of

50
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:46,640
history

51
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,879
i announced that i will be having this

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,920
conversation with albert berla pfizer

53
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,640
ceo and a lot of people wrote to me

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,240
i would like to say that i was and am

55
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,759
and always will be listening and

56
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:02,718
learning with an open mind from everyone

57
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,159
my own opinion worth little as it is is

58
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:06,000
that the development of the coveted

59
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,600
vaccines is one of the greatest

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,560
accomplishments of science and recent

61
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:11,359
history

62
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,319
for the rest from safety and efficacy to

63
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,480
policy and economics i stand humbled

64
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,079
before a complicated world full of fear

65
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,318
and anger

66
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,640
a small number of malicious people from

67
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,639
all walks of life will use that fear and

68
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:26,799
anger to divide us

69
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,958
because the division makes them money

70
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,120
and gives them power

71
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:33,680
i took two shots of the fisa vaccine

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,080
this was my decision i don't ever want

73
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,239
to force this on anyone and i certainly

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,120
don't want to dismiss your concerns or

75
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,878
worse you as a person if you choose not

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,959
to get vaccinated

77
00:02:42,878 --> 00:02:47,919
i can assure you one thing in this

78
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,080
conversation and in any conversation the

79
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:53,039
choice of questions i ask and words i

80
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,840
say is mine and mine alone when my words

81
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,598
fall short as they often do

82
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,479
it is only because of the limitations of

83
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:03,039
my mind and of my speaking ability it is

84
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,598
not due to pressure or fear

85
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,000
i'm not afraid of anyone i cannot be

86
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:10,719
bought by anyone with money power or

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,360
fame i hope to prove this to you and to

88
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:16,080
myself in the coming years

89
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,959
this life is short and to me without

90
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,360
integrity it is not worth living

91
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,560
people sometimes talk down to me call me

92
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,319
naive

93
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,560
perhaps they are right

94
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,958
but it is who i am

95
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,400
i think this life this world

96
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,560
this our human civilization is beautiful

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,439
and as dostoyevsky said

98
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,598
beauty will save the world

99
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,598
this is a lex friedman podcast and

100
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:46,878
here's my conversation with albert berla

101
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,798
the development of the coven 19 vaccine

102
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,199
was one of the greatest accomplishments

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,120
of science in recent history no matter

104
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,359
what this should give people hope for

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,438
the future and yet it is more of a

106
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,599
source of division

107
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,959
i hope we can discuss both the inspiring

108
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:02,399
and the difficult ideas in this

109
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,400
conversation

110
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,239
so that we can do our small part in

111
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,519
healing this division

112
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,280
i hope so

113
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,360
take me through the day of november 8th

114
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,280
2020 when the pfizer team were waiting

115
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
for the results of the phase 3 clinical

116
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
trials

117
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:19,199
we had assembled in a very small office

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,239
that we are having in connecticut very

119
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,240
few people

120
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,079
there were five i think

121
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,560
and

122
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,079
in in another place

123
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,000
what we call the data monitoring

124
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,079
committee which is a group of experts

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,439
independent experts they're on pfizer

126
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,800
we're going to have

127
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,918
the opportunity to unblind the data

128
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,040
and then

129
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:44,000
tell us if the study needs to continue

130
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,919
or if it is successful or if it fails

131
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,360
and we were waiting for their call so

132
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:48,719
the call came

133
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,520
a little bit later when what was

134
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,080
expected which created a lot of

135
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,599
anxiety to all of us but came around i

136
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,439
think two o'clock you're just sitting

137
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,040
there waiting what were you feeling

138
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,439
sitting there waiting and teasing one

139
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,319
another

140
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,918
drinking coffee making jokes

141
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,399
so what how did you feel like when you

142
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:11,279
heard the results

143
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:13,839
the successful results

144
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,079
free liberated and

145
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,918
happy

146
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:20,560
like if a

147
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,120
huge weight that was

148
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,639
on my shoulders was lifted

149
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,759
i heard you uh

150
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
said i love you to the team

151
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,360
i did

152
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,759
you know

153
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,600
this is how we speak in uh

154
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:36,000
in the mediterranean listen maybe it's

155
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,560
the russian thing too i i i

156
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,600
love love so i appreciate that kind of

157
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,038
uh

158
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,039
celebration

159
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,879
so looking back from that moment to

160
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,159
before how much did it cost to develop

161
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,839
the pfizer

162
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,600
biontech vaccine

163
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,519
what was it like making the decision to

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,759
make that investment

165
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:56,079
when the risk is very high and you don't

166
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,240
know if it's going to be successful

167
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,879
you know we do a lot of that anyway this

168
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
is what we do in our daily work we are

169
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:02,719
putting

170
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:04,560
money

171
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,039
we are investing in research which is

172
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,918
highly risky the difference in that case

173
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:09,599
was

174
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:10,719
that within the risk at all we put it

175
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,479
all in

176
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,520
we put everything

177
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,839
in one go so that we don't lose time

178
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,599
usually we'll spend 50 millions and then

179
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,279
if that goes well then we will spend

180
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,240
another 50 and then if it goes well then

181
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,918
100. here we put all together

182
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,439
a little bit more than 2 billion dollars

183
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:29,758
2.3

184
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:31,360
billion dollars and

185
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,600
it was a

186
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,038
significant decision

187
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,639
but it was a very easy decision to make

188
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:39,680
in the context of what we were living at

189
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,160
that time

190
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,400
it was pandemic people were scared we

191
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,319
were scared we didn't know how tomorrow

192
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,120
looked like

193
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,000
we were living unprecedented situations

194
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
and

195
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,240
we knew

196
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,800
that we have capabilities that may help

197
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,038
so there was not a second question or

198
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,759
choice we go all in

199
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:04,800
when you make decisions like that

200
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:08,000
you're the ceo of a company

201
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,319
that needs to make money

202
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,720
and that

203
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,280
hopes to do a lot of good in the world

204
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,199
how much of both of those things are

205
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:21,038
part of the calculation

206
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:24,560
so when you said it was a obvious choice

207
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,800
um i think you've said a bunch of things

208
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,598
of the kind of saying we need to go all

209
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,199
in

210
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:35,199
instead of very boldly diving in

211
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,199
how much was that that the world is

212
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,879
facing uncertainty and fear and

213
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,879
potentially

214
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,159
destructive pandemic in the early days

215
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,918
just when you're seeing the full

216
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,000
uncertainty before us don't know how

217
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,439
it's going to unroll and how much of it

218
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,360
is

219
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:52,000
this may also be a good financial

220
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,000
decision to take this risk yeah i think

221
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,879
about it all the time and i know very

222
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,399
well

223
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,400
that if you focus too much on making

224
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,839
money you will never make

225
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:03,679
you should focus in what is the real

226
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:06,079
value driver and the real

227
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,840
value driver it is to

228
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,800
make breakthroughs that change patients

229
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:10,399
lives

230
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,280
if you don't do that you will never make

231
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:12,478
money

232
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:14,559
if you do that

233
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,399
don't worry things will fall into place

234
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,478
and also money will follow

235
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,399
but the mentality of the company needs

236
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,199
to be how to help the pace and that's

237
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:22,878
what

238
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,960
the management was that the shareholders

239
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,840
want because that's the only way that we

240
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,758
can create value in this particular case

241
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,158
we're not thinking at all

242
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,000
about what are we going to

243
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,718
make when we sell it or if we not sell

244
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,839
it

245
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,159
because what we were focusing 100 was

246
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,640
how to bring a solution to the world

247
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,958
that will help all of us

248
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:46,480
change the way the fear that was bring

249
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,199
hope to the world

250
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,920
and

251
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,360
as always when you do that you will have

252
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,360
good returns as well

253
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,360
on a philosophical level on a human

254
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,600
level do you ever worry

255
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,278
that the pressure to cover the costs

256
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,040
that were invested

257
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:05,039
to develop a new drug to develop this

258
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,278
vaccine

259
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,480
harms your ability to conduct unbiased

260
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,958
studies

261
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,879
ah not at all because the studies are

262
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,599
highly regulated

263
00:09:12,879 --> 00:09:18,000
everybody knows what regulators and when

264
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,480
i say regulators fda

265
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,240
european authorities uk authorities

266
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,039
israeli authorities japanese authorities

267
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:27,360
canadian authorities want to see

268
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,799
how the study needs to be conducted

269
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,240
and what exactly they need to see to

270
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:31,599
approve it or not

271
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,680
so

272
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,200
clearly everybody takes into

273
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:36,799
consideration how much money i'm going

274
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,600
to invest and what is the chances that

275
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:42,079
i'm going to to lose them but what you

276
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,560
can do is to change the rules of the

277
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,959
game so that you won't lose the money

278
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,359
there are very well established

279
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:51,199
methodologies that would say

280
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,759
with very high precision if your

281
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,120
medicine is effective if your medicine

282
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:59,679
is safe and those are there for all and

283
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,078
are playing with the same rules

284
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,679
do you have an intuition about why is

285
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:08,078
the fda trying to get 75 years

286
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:10,239
to release the pfizer data they're

287
00:10:08,078 --> 00:10:12,399
trying to request that it will not be

288
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,680
released for 75 years

289
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,600
and then

290
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,278
maybe the broader version of that

291
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,639
question is do you think

292
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,200
people should have

293
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,199
sort of um full transparency and

294
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,200
immediate access to the data immediate

295
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,200
you know on the scale of weeks not years

296
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,200
i think the relations with

297
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,519
with regulators they have been always

298
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
very transparent and there are a lot of

299
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,679
laws that

300
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,360
they are forcing

301
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,679
regulators to

302
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,600
end companies to put out there their

303
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,719
interactions and what exactly was

304
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,959
discussed

305
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,639
now to to go into specific details of

306
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,799
of some discussions i don't know what is

307
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,799
the reason that fda wants to take the

308
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
time and but i'm sure they have very

309
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,679
good reasons

310
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,919
well let me just say my side of it

311
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,439
it doesn't look like a good reason it

312
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,919
looks like maybe it's because i come

313
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,560
from the soviet union now this is not

314
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:09,759
you saying this this is me saying this

315
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:11,759
um

316
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,519
is there seems to be a bureaucracy that

317
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,360
gets in the way of transparency that's

318
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,519
always the challenge with government so

319
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,200
government is very good at setting rules

320
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,679
and making sure there's oversight over

321
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,480
companies and people and so on but they

322
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,239
create they slow things down which is a

323
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,320
feature and a bug

324
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,639
and in this case they slowed down so

325
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,560
much i think the reason they said it at

326
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,039
75 years is because

327
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,359
they set a rate of being able to only

328
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:39,439
review 500 pages of data a day or

329
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,759
something like that and that's a very

330
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,800
kind of bureaucratic thing where in

331
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,240
reality you could just show the data

332
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:47,519
and it's not like something is being

333
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,079
hidden

334
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,078
but in the battle to win people's trust

335
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,519
to inspire them with science it feels

336
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:55,278
like transparency is one of the most

337
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,600
beautiful things one of the most

338
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,799
powerful things that the fda has

339
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,560
fda is

340
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:03,120
has the potential to be one of the great

341
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:05,199
institutions of our country and uh this

342
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,879
is one example that it feels

343
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,879
to me like a failure so in your

344
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,519
perspective you're saying i'm sure they

345
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,278
have a good reason so to you the fda is

346
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,759
this black box

347
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:17,439
that you submit things to once they

348
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,720
approve

349
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,440
you know that

350
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,720
those are the rules it's approved that's

351
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,959
it but this is not a black box we know

352
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,278
very well what

353
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,958
is the process everybody knows very well

354
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:32,159
what are the processes

355
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,638
the

356
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:36,639
review process also it is

357
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,039
very detailed they have scientists of

358
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:41,680
very very high caliber not every

359
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,559
regulator in the world but the europeans

360
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,958
the

361
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:46,638
the bridge the fda clearly

362
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,638
they have very very high caliber of

363
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,959
scientists that they are going into

364
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,639
a lot of details and

365
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:55,679
also

366
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,639
basically everything for a study is

367
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,039
really

368
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,879
released by law in the

369
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:02,958
specifications of the product but it's a

370
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,278
very detailed document yeah but it is

371
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:08,078
issue and has basically the essence of

372
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:09,360
everything was discussed i don't know

373
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,679
about

374
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,759
specific documents if take them time to

375
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:14,799
release but clearly this is not a black

376
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,519
box

377
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:19,199
type of process a lot of this stuff is

378
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,480
how do you effectively communicate to

379
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
the world

380
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,600
about the incredible science that's been

381
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,839
done about the processes that were

382
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,240
followed and i agree with you and

383
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,240
sometimes it's just ineloquence in

384
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,079
communication it's not that there's a

385
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,959
failure process it's ineligible to

386
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:37,120
communication and silence silence in the

387
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,239
moment when clearly a lot of people are

388
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,000
bothered

389
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,320
and have questions

390
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,639
this is when you speak out and you

391
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,040
explain exactly why

392
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,879
as as opposed to letting the sort of

393
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:50,078
distrust build up

394
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,439
and linger

395
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:53,599
because the result is there's a very

396
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,880
large percentage of the population that

397
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,159
just

398
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,240
um

399
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,120
i mean it divides people

400
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,759
and science suffers i think

401
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:08,240
and also the effectiveness of solutions

402
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:08,240
suffers like the vaccine and so on

403
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,198
i asked a few folks i know if they had

404
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,799
challenging questions for you i'm sure

405
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:16,799
many of them

406
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:19,519
answer your call

407
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,359
uh yeah uh yeah yeah you know many

408
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,240
friendly folks out there uh by the way

409
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,159
i'm sweating not because um this is a

410
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,440
difficult conversation it is but it's

411
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:31,600
also hot in here for the record

412
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,959
so one of the folks is mr jordan

413
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
peterson

414
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:37,278
i don't know if you know who that is

415
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,319
he's a psychologist and intellectual and

416
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,000
author

417
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,000
he suggested to me that i raised the

418
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,600
concern that there is a close working

419
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:48,720
relationship between pfizer fda and cdc

420
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,278
so we we talked about fda

421
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,120
do you worry that this affects both

422
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,600
positive and negative

423
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,679
uh pfizer's chances of getting drugs

424
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,680
approved the fact that there's people

425
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:02,159
you know that worked at the fda that now

426
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,000
work at pfizer pfizer fda that there's a

427
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:07,919
kind of pipeline

428
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
does this worry you that it affects your

429
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,559
ability to do great

430
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,039
unbiased work

431
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,559
i have zero doubts that this is not

432
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,759
affecting at all

433
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,958
their ability to be unbiased and

434
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,278
regulate

435
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:26,479
and in order to for this the system also

436
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,799
reinforces that by creating significant

437
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,839
time barriers if someone moves from an

438
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:34,479
industry to fda she won't be able to

439
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,079
deal with topics for a period of time

440
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,519
and then for even an enhanced period of

441
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,799
time with topics that are related with

442
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,720
the company he or she may come from

443
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,719
i think these

444
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,399
regulators they are

445
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,240
very very strict

446
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,559
uh rightly so

447
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,159
if anything i feel sometimes that maybe

448
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:52,879
they should

449
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,799
be

450
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:56,078
a little bit more open-minded

451
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:57,278
particularly when it comes to new

452
00:15:56,078 --> 00:15:59,120
technologies

453
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,519
rather than trying to judge

454
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,360
and implement the same framework of

455
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,919
variation of new technologies to all

456
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,720
they are always as regulators in the

457
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:11,838
conservative side but

458
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,560
always always they are unbiased and they

459
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,839
are trying uh the best and it's not only

460
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:17,599
one or two people

461
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,480
they have processes to make sure that

462
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,759
their self checks and balances within

463
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,440
the agencies both in cdc and in the fda

464
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,159
difficult decisions they bring external

465
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,079
experts that they should express easy

466
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:31,759
decisions they are internal experts that

467
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,239
they are debating a lot and if there are

468
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,759
disagreements they elevate them so

469
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,600
i think it's

470
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,000
we are lucky to have

471
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,639
good regulators i think

472
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,039
i agree with what you said before

473
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,480
as with all governmental agencies there

474
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,480
is bureaucracy

475
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,680
and the bureaucracy needs to be

476
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,360
addressed

477
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,719
and by saying the rockets is not

478
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,000
relaxing

479
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,639
the

480
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,078
the bar the bar needs to remain high

481
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,519
but uh

482
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,239
being uh

483
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,318
focusing on what matters rather than

484
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,720
on the on the detail

485
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:08,480
so you don't you know

486
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,558
i've been reading quite a bit about

487
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,360
history you don't worry about human

488
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:15,359
nature and corruption that can seep in

489
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,359
you're saying institutionally there's

490
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,119
protections against this i think there

491
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,599
is always

492
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,078
the the fear of corruption particularly

493
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,480
when you speak about public servants

494
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,558
but uh clearly the risk is very

495
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,960
different country by country

496
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:33,038
and speaking about and agencies by

497
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,319
entrances i think the regulatory

498
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,079
agencies

499
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,879
have a very good track record and

500
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:39,918
history of the us of europe of

501
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,480
england

502
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,640
of a very very good track record of

503
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,319
integrity

504
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:50,000
it's uh something i think about so i

505
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:52,480
grew up in the soviet union and um

506
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,519
i need to perhaps introspect this a

507
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:58,480
little bit but when i was growing up

508
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:00,400
ethically there was a sense

509
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,440
that bribery is the only way you can get

510
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,840
stuff done

511
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,679
that that was the system of the time uh

512
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,918
like you get pulled over by a police

513
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,880
officer like obviously you need to bribe

514
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,280
them

515
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,440
i mean it was like the way of life

516
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:15,279
um and then so coming to this country

517
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,720
was is beautiful to see that the rule of

518
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:20,558
law has so much power and ultimately the

519
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,120
rule of law

520
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:25,519
when enacted when

521
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,479
uh when it holds up it gives people

522
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,400
freedom

523
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,880
to do the best work of their lives

524
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,038
but they're still human nature and that

525
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,480
that worries me a lot here and again it

526
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:36,798
goes back to the perception the

527
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,798
communication when there's people that

528
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,519
have worked at pfizer

529
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:42,960
and an fda at the cdc

530
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,720
you know you look at their resume they

531
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,640
have those things on their resume it

532
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,960
worries people

533
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,480
are these great leaders

534
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,319
that we are supposed to see as

535
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,480
authorities

536
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,839
are they playing a game on us

537
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,558
i would say

538
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,959
that uh i recognize what you said about

539
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:01,678
what happened in uh or what i'm sure

540
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,440
that

541
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,280
what you describe in

542
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,160
the country that you're coming from it

543
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,319
was

544
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,480
how you experienced it and i know that

545
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,200
there are other countries that you need

546
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,200
to do these things to do your job

547
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,679
i don't think is the case

548
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
in this country

549
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,720
particularly when it comes to those

550
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,798
agencies that you mentioned

551
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:25,519
i think they have a very

552
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,879
high track record and also i don't think

553
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:29,599
that there are a lot of people that they

554
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,679
are worried about it or doubt i'm sure

555
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:34,000
like everywhere there will be a minority

556
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,519
but the vast majority of the americans

557
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,440
the vast majority of the europeans the

558
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,639
vast majority of the brits the vast

559
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,000
majority of the israelis they trust

560
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,520
what fda or ema or cdc

561
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
or mhra

562
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:50,000
will say

563
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
still there is currently a distrust of

564
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,679
big pharma in the public maybe this is

565
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,599
something i'd love to hear your comment

566
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,280
on

567
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,798
there's the stress of science when it's

568
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,399
tangled up with corporations and

569
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,639
government institutions like we've

570
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,960
talked about

571
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,120
but you have they have to be entangled

572
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
to achieve scale

573
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,479
oversight and to achieve the kind of

574
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,799
skill that pfizer has been able to

575
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,480
accomplish

576
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:18,400
how can pfizer regain the public trust

577
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,558
how can you regain the public trust do

578
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,679
you think not regain but sort of take

579
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:24,158
steps

580
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,679
to increase the public trust

581
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:30,320
reputation is something that

582
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,640
you can lose in buckets but you can earn

583
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,158
it back in drops

584
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,000
and

585
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,960
once you lost it

586
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,240
you are going to take a lot of effort to

587
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,400
bring it back

588
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,159
and the pharmaceutical industry lost it

589
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,280
it's clear that the reputation of the

590
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:50,000
industry

591
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:51,839
in the last decade was on the lowest

592
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,679
that we have seen

593
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:56,558
ever and

594
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,640
for there are many reasons for that

595
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,839
but clearly there are reasons that are

596
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,159
related also with the behavior of the

597
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:06,240
industry that needed to change and i'm

598
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,440
hopeful that

599
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,120
very few

600
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,159
will disagree that the industry is a

601
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,158
very different industry right now

602
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:18,240
that being said

603
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,720
i truly believe that uh if there is one

604
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,240
lesson that stands out

605
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,759
from the main lessons that we learned

606
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,480
here in covet

607
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:28,960
is the power of science in the hands of

608
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,240
the private sector

609
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:35,440
i think it was the private sector

610
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,240
that came with solutions with diagnostic

611
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,080
tests when we didn't have

612
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,519
solutions with respirators when we

613
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:43,759
didn't have

614
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,359
solutions with treatments solutions with

615
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,319
vaccines

616
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,439
and

617
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:52,158
i think that demonstrated very clearly

618
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,679
to the world the value

619
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,200
of a

620
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,759
thriving

621
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,240
life sciences sector private lifestyle

622
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:03,119
sector to society

623
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,400
that also affected very positively the

624
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:08,000
reputation

625
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,600
both of the sector and of pfizer

626
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,279
i'm not going to make the mistake to

627
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:12,399
consider given

628
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,079
i'm not making

629
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,840
to make the mistake that because our

630
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,439
occupation is high

631
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,319
that will remain so

632
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,919
we need to earn it every day every day

633
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:23,759
with everything we do

634
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,960
with everything we say with the way we

635
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,400
behave

636
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,159
and i hope

637
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,919
that we'll rise to this occasion and

638
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,480
we'll do that

639
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,919
you've been in pfizer for 28 years time

640
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,519
flies when you're having fun and you've

641
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,600
become ceo

642
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,519
in 2019

643
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:41,839
it is the company you love

644
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:43,519
a company you believe in

645
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:46,158
it's a company that has developed drugs

646
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:49,918
that has helped millions of people

647
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,799
so let me ask yet another hard question

648
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:55,120
on this topic of reputation in 2009

649
00:22:52,798 --> 00:22:57,679
pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal

650
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:01,279
marketing of arthritis drug bextra and

651
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:03,120
agreed to 2.3 billion settlement

652
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,720
how do you make sense of the fact that

653
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,639
this happened

654
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,960
to a company you love and that you

655
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:11,120
believe in yes

656
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:14,000
the dextra case

657
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:16,239
in 2009 was related to things that

658
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,919
happened in 2003

659
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,880
and the things that happened in 2003

660
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:24,080
were things that basically several of

661
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,159
our apps did off-label promos

662
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,720
so they spoke about

663
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,200
with the physicians about off-label use

664
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,679
of the product and they shouldn't

665
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,080
and can you clarify so off-label are

666
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,880
things that the fda didn't approve extra

667
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:38,879
stuff

668
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,720
you basically say this drug does extra

669
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,480
stuff that the fda never approved

670
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,798
correct and this is something that it is

671
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,558
allowed when physicians are speaking to

672
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:49,278
physicians but it is not allowed for the

673
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,278
pharmaceutical companies to refer to

674
00:23:49,278 --> 00:23:52,960
this studies because usually our studies

675
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:53,839
that are happening of labor

676
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,079
and

677
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:57,359
apparently several of our reps in 2003

678
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,558
they did it

679
00:23:57,359 --> 00:23:59,439
and

680
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:00,558
we had to

681
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,759
[Music]

682
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:05,119
to settle in 2009 and we paid a very big

683
00:24:03,759 --> 00:24:07,278
fine as you said

684
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:08,959
the fine was related not to

685
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:12,159
the severity of the contact but the size

686
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,679
of the revenues so this the fines are if

687
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:15,200
dexter was a small product we would get

688
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,600
a small fine vector was a very big

689
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,440
product and we got a very large fine

690
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:24,719
very bad what happened in 2003

691
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:27,278
i don't think that these things

692
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,000
happened since then we have a stellar

693
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:33,440
record from 2009 until now

694
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,679
of complying with every single

695
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,440
regulation and rule we have internal

696
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,038
processes to make sure

697
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,840
that these are not happening by

698
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:44,158
individuals that may have an interest

699
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:46,079
for example to get a promotion they may

700
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,200
try and do things that they are not the

701
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:51,038
right things

702
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,558
and we have more importantly a culture

703
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,200
in this company

704
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,480
that really sets aside people that they

705
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,000
think differently

706
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,679
so i

707
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
didn't like what happened in 2003

708
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,759
but i believe a lot has changed in the

709
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,679
20 years that followed

710
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:09,679
almost 20 years

711
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,759
so you're developing drugs you're

712
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,798
developing solutions to help millions of

713
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:16,158
people but there's risk involved

714
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:18,480
and so

715
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,400
there will be lawsuits heading back your

716
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,839
way

717
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,200
because there's a lot of lawyers in the

718
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,759
world

719
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,759
partially

720
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,159
how do you put that into the calculation

721
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,319
of of how you tried to do good in the

722
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,600
world

723
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:38,158
um

724
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:40,079
that some of the causes the lawsuits

725
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,400
how do you uh

726
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,960
not fall victim to thinking that it's

727
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,320
just the cost of doing business and then

728
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,319
some of the losses might actually

729
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,599
represent real pain that people are

730
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:51,519
going through

731
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,519
you know i i think that we try always to

732
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,639
do the right thing and that's as i said

733
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,119
very

734
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,960
well embedded into our culture if you

735
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,119
don't do the right thing

736
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,919
sooner or later you will pay for it

737
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,319
one way or another yeah and right now

738
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,520
for us doing the right thing it is

739
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:12,399
being able to find innovations to

740
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,798
issues that are real

741
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,679
diseases that they do not have good

742
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,359
coverage good treatments right now

743
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,360
we try to find treatments that

744
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:25,839
significantly

745
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:27,199
surpass the current standards of care

746
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,359
and we try

747
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,798
not only to comply with what regulators

748
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,479
are asking us to do this is what you

749
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:34,720
need to do to prove the safety or the

750
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,200
efficacy but exceed them

751
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,960
no matter what we do on that

752
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,080
i'm sure that people will find

753
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
opportunity because as you said there

754
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,720
are a lot of lawyers to sue us but we

755
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,080
believe in the justice system and we

756
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,440
believe that

757
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:49,759
eventually

758
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,720
if you are doing the right thing

759
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:53,038
you will

760
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,120
be on the right side of the history

761
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,119
i'm really glad you say that because um

762
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,959
focusing on doing the right thing no

763
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,600
matter the money

764
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,880
i believe is the best way to make money

765
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,480
just exactly

766
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,240
and also in another way in other realms

767
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,558
creating a product that people love is

768
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:15,200
the best way to make money so focusing

769
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:17,200
on the on the core of the thing that

770
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,600
makes people feel good that brings value

771
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,200
to people's lives

772
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,119
so i'm now in austin texas

773
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,120
my good friend joe rogan

774
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:29,119
he's been highlighting to me

775
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,959
this aggressive uh

776
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,278
marketing on mainstream media channels

777
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,200
by pfizer so let me ask the general

778
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:36,640
marketing question

779
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,278
do you see this as a conflict of

780
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,399
interest is it my bias the reporting of

781
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:43,359
news

782
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:46,239
that a lot of us a lot of people

783
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:48,719
me included look to these mainstream

784
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,240
channels of news for kind of authority

785
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,519
of like what the heck's going on in the

786
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,399
world

787
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:55,679
and

788
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,038
if pfizer is sponsoring

789
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,080
uh

790
00:27:57,038 --> 00:28:00,079
many of these shows

791
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,880
there's a worry it may be a perception

792
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,398
thing but there's also natural worry

793
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,679
that it would influence what they're

794
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:10,000
talking about because they're afraid of

795
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:12,480
losing the sponsorship it's subtle

796
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,880
but at scale it might have a serious

797
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,960
impact do you worry about this

798
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,919
i think people could go one way or

799
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,360
another

800
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:24,480
because of multiple reasons

801
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:27,519
from our perspective we

802
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,720
i don't think we have aggressive

803
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,679
marketing

804
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,038
what do we do we go on tv and we are

805
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,038
having

806
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,079
ads about our products

807
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:38,240
and

808
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,398
they are highly regulated

809
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,960
i think it is the right of people to

810
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:44,798
know to learn that if there is a product

811
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,278
like that it's very

812
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:48,798
clearly that we cannot say things that

813
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,960
they are off-label that have not been

814
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:54,079
approved we need to have every time we

815
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,000
go on tv as you know fda is forcing

816
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,158
us to say also the bad things that can

817
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,679
happen for a medicine sometimes that

818
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,278
takes more time

819
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,640
than the good things

820
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:04,640
and i don't think that we are doing

821
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,360
aggressive marketing

822
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,320
no

823
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,639
people could be influenced

824
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,960
in and can be biased in in the podcasts

825
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,799
or in the other type of media

826
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,519
activities that they have for multiple

827
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:19,918
different reasons

828
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,240
yeah i know but it's still it's pressure

829
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,240
it's human nature i mean i i if it's one

830
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,919
of those perception but i i worry about

831
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,839
you i think i have a ton of sponsors for

832
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,440
this podcast for example and none of

833
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,759
them ever asked me to

834
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,038
anything they're just you know

835
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,398
i think

836
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,319
likely that kind of pressure is not

837
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:39,278
happening for pfizer

838
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,599
but there's implied pressure sometimes

839
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:45,440
and i worry about that a lot

840
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:48,319
because um you know i look at academia

841
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,600
like i i look for the good in people i

842
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:53,519
tend to believe most people are good or

843
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,879
have the capacity to be good and desire

844
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,759
to be good

845
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,640
when i came to mit i

846
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:00,640
i was a little bit

847
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,798
disappointed maybe heartbroken

848
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,240
how much pressure

849
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,038
i think unjustified pressure people felt

850
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,799
from financial constraints

851
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,119
especially at mit when there's i think a

852
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,278
lot of money

853
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,558
people still felt constraints

854
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,319
and they weren't

855
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,678
it wasn't bringing out the best in them

856
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:27,519
they weren't supporting each other they

857
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,919
weren't loving each other like

858
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,519
celebrating each other's successes

859
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,000
i don't want to blame money on

860
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,960
everything money constraints but

861
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,200
when you have sponsors it just um

862
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,200
i personally worry that it doesn't bring

863
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,159
the best out of people

864
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,919
and so

865
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:46,799
i feel like i want to put some

866
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,480
responsibility on sponsors and and great

867
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:52,398
big companies

868
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,558
like pfizer to to kind of uh

869
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:56,158
not

870
00:30:54,558 --> 00:30:58,398
get in the way of the best of human

871
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,000
nature whether it's sponsoring uh

872
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,239
podcasts

873
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,960
mainstream media

874
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,278
like i don't know athletes whatever yeah

875
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,440
you need to know that we are so so

876
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,640
careful with sponsorships first of all

877
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,000
we have very few

878
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,559
very very few

879
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,640
we have a team that for every single one

880
00:31:14,558 --> 00:31:18,079
could be two thousand dollars

881
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,240
they will try to see if there is a

882
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,398
conflict of interest in the way we do it

883
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,359
and also what is the reputation

884
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:24,158
of the

885
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:26,639
of

886
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,799
the the persons or the programs that we

887
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,159
are sponsoring so

888
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,798
i don't think

889
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,760
our friend i think was from texas uh yes

890
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:39,278
yeah i don't hear rogan yes yes

891
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,200
i don't think he got it right that we do

892
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:42,960
those type of things

893
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,960
we don't oh in terms of manipu like

894
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,640
having a negative effect on not even

895
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,919
having aggressive sponsorships we have

896
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,840
very few

897
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,519
yeah when you clip them all together and

898
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,879
most of the sponsorship that we have it

899
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:56,960
is more on patient related organizations

900
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,278
right rather than we are very careful

901
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,759
not to sponsor other things that can be

902
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:03,200
perceived not even

903
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:04,798
influenced but perceived that we may

904
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,360
influence so we are very very careful on

905
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:10,798
that this is not the case with us

906
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:13,199
so with the incredibly fast development

907
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,359
of the vaccine

908
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,640
could you tell me the story from the

909
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:19,678
engineering

910
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:22,640
to the science to the human story of how

911
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,038
you could do it so fast

912
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:27,200
by november you even had the ambition to

913
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:28,480
do it by october it was in the initial

914
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,038
days

915
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,558
how do you eight days later

916
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:34,640
in that time

917
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,240
how do you show that the vaccine is safe

918
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,720
and effective

919
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,440
uh given that i think previous vaccines

920
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:43,278
have taken years to do that yeah

921
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,600
the vaccines take years to do that and

922
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:48,720
the the time

923
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:50,959
that it takes it is basically

924
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,159
the vast majority the time to conduct

925
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,159
the final

926
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,278
phase 3 study that is the confirmatory

927
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,640
study

928
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,319
and you do that because the phase 3

929
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,640
study cost a lot of money in our case

930
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,200
cost almost a billion

931
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:06,080
so you don't want to go and risk a

932
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:09,120
billion in blind data normally before

933
00:33:06,079 --> 00:33:10,879
you do a lot of experiments to make sure

934
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,439
that the product that you're putting in

935
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,039
the phase 3 is the right one

936
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,278
we didn't have the time

937
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:22,079
so we risked all the money so we went

938
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:24,079
into we condensed all the time towards

939
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:27,359
this phase three but the phase three

940
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,038
study had to follow all the rules that

941
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:30,079
any study

942
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,079
follows

943
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:33,519
when you do this trial could you just

944
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,839
briefly

945
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,759
describe the basics of what is phase one

946
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,759
what is phase two what is phase three

947
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,558
let's say that there are so many phases

948
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,960
when you try first of all to find what

949
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:46,798
is the right vaccine we tried from 20

950
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,600
different vaccines we nailed down to

951
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:49,519
four

952
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:52,319
and for those four we selected

953
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,679
eventually two and then eventually one

954
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:56,319
once you have

955
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,559
those selections what is the dose you're

956
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:01,359
going to use and then we tried multiple

957
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,359
different doses to see which one we

958
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,319
think is the best what does trying

959
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,678
entail in those early days you go first

960
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:09,119
of all with

961
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,280
smaller

962
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,200
doses in humans

963
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,200
and then after you have done a lot of

964
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,960
experiments in animals

965
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,559
so that you can feel that it is safe

966
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,358
enough to go to humans and then go with

967
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,599
very

968
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:23,039
low dose and then you gradually increase

969
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,079
the dose and then you monitor those

970
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:28,639
humans to make sure that there are not

971
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:30,399
any let's say reactogenicity to what you

972
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,399
are giving them at the same time you

973
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,039
start to measure what is doing in terms

974
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,199
of

975
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,800
immune responses so you do that with

976
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,799
multiple vaccines and you do that with

977
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,200
multiple doses and you do that with

978
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,399
multiple ages of people young people all

979
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,559
people

980
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:46,878
and eventually

981
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:49,199
from the 20 vaccines to multiple doses

982
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,118
to multiple schedules is it after

983
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:53,759
three weeks the second dose or is it

984
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,119
after four weeks or after six months

985
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,000
all of that will inform you

986
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:02,720
that i think this is the vaccine this is

987
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,838
the dose this is the scheme that i

988
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,759
believe

989
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:07,759
will give me the best results and when

990
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,760
you have that then you go to do what we

991
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,240
call the phase three

992
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:14,160
this is a very big study

993
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:15,919
with thousands of people

994
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:17,358
where you use the vaccine that you think

995
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,440
is the right one

996
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:21,440
and a placebo

997
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,639
the placebo in the vaccine they look

998
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,000
identical

999
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,480
nobody knows

1000
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,960
if is injected the placebo or vaccine

1001
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,559
the physician that makes the injection

1002
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,240
the doctor doesn't know if he's

1003
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:37,279
injecting placebo or vaccine he knows a

1004
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:39,118
barcode only the computer knows

1005
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,880
in order to go into this computer there

1006
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,960
are keys and there are at least two

1007
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,880
people that needs to put their keys so

1008
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,800
that someone can see the data

1009
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,720
and there's those people

1010
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,440
they have legal obligations never to do

1011
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,319
that

1012
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,838
right so before a certain point so all

1013
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,720
of that is blinded

1014
00:35:53,838 --> 00:35:59,279
the idea is that when you go into this

1015
00:35:56,719 --> 00:36:00,879
study you need to make sure that you are

1016
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,119
going with the right one that's why it

1017
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,240
takes so many so much time but the study

1018
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:06,240
is the study

1019
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:07,279
you need to have a significant number of

1020
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,759
people

1021
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,280
that will give the two and then you let

1022
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,280
them live their lives and then you see

1023
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,800
how many of them will get the disease

1024
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,040
and then you see if

1025
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,200
there are differences in percentage of

1026
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,880
infections for the vaccinated compared

1027
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:23,039
to the non-vaccinate at the same time

1028
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:24,320
you're monitoring all of them to see if

1029
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,559
there are differences in the safety

1030
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,079
profile if those that go to placebo have

1031
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:29,759
the same let's say

1032
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,800
heart attacks with those that they

1033
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,240
didn't

1034
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,560
they got the vaccine because heart

1035
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,919
attacks will happen if you have 50 000

1036
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,480
people that

1037
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,480
because it's part of life these are the

1038
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,599
all these processes are very very

1039
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,599
very well established and since years

1040
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,760
what we did the last one was exactly the

1041
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,119
same as we did always we just didn't

1042
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:51,599
lose time

1043
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:52,640
we didn't we were not careful with money

1044
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,838
instead of

1045
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:57,039
recruiting 50 000 people over

1046
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,799
a year

1047
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,599
because we had let's say

1048
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,680
30 hospitals doing the recruitment

1049
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,838
we went with 150 hospitals doing the

1050
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,919
recruitment that cost a lot of money but

1051
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:10,159
instead of recruiting them in a year we

1052
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,079
recruited them in three four months so i

1053
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,960
did this type of things

1054
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,920
by

1055
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,000
taking

1056
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,400
return on investment taking cost out of

1057
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,760
the equation and we were able to achieve

1058
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,720
this result but

1059
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,440
it's not

1060
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:25,039
the process believe me it is the heart

1061
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:27,358
of the people

1062
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:29,279
people don't know what they can and what

1063
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:31,519
they cannot do

1064
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,240
and if anything they have a serious

1065
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:35,199
tendency to underestimate what they can

1066
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,479
do

1067
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:38,639
and always

1068
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,480
when you ask them something that is

1069
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,559
seemingly impossible

1070
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,320
they will think out of the box to be

1071
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:46,159
able to deliver

1072
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,800
we discussed about the timing instead of

1073
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:50,399
eight years we then asked them to do it

1074
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,640
in six we asked them to do it in eight

1075
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,160
months

1076
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:58,480
our normal manufacturing

1077
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:00,719
yearly production files was 200 million

1078
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,800
doses of vaccines every year that was we

1079
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,559
are doing in the last 10 years

1080
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,560
we didn't ask them to make 300 million

1081
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,480
dollars for a new vaccine we asked him

1082
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,880
to make three billion

1083
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,679
doses for a new vaccine

1084
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,119
the discovery phase of a new molecule

1085
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,239
like the treatment that we have now the

1086
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,760
pill against coffee takes four years we

1087
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,279
then ask them to do it in three we ask

1088
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,480
them to do it in four months which is

1089
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:25,760
what they did

1090
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:28,480
when you are setting this type of goals

1091
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:30,160
they know immediately they cannot

1092
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,000
just think within the box

1093
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:34,559
and immediately this is where the human

1094
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,280
ingenuity and the heart comes and this

1095
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,358
is how they surprised all of us

1096
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,280
so there's incredible science and

1097
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,039
engineering going on here this time

1098
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:45,119
absolutely

1099
00:38:43,039 --> 00:38:48,880
this is what's bothering me

1100
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,838
that the conversation in the in public

1101
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,880
is often not about that

1102
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:54,799
you know it's about politics

1103
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,599
unfortunately politics so i spent the

1104
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:00,800
day with elon musk yesterday

1105
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:02,880
he works with rockets uh similar

1106
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,440
situation as with pfizer in the sense

1107
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,960
that there's nasa and then there's this

1108
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,280
private company

1109
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,358
and that's a source of incredible

1110
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,119
inspiration to people

1111
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:17,920
no politics very little politics

1112
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,800
um so this is part of the thing i'm

1113
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,358
trying to i'm hoping to do our little

1114
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,480
part in this conversation to

1115
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,159
help untangle a little bit just reveal

1116
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,880
the beauty

1117
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:32,559
and the power of the thing that was done

1118
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,920
here especially with vaccine but other

1119
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,880
things that are being done with the with

1120
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,880
the antiviral drug

1121
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,399
let me just kind of linger on the safety

1122
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,240
what can you say

1123
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,760
there's a lot of people that

1124
00:39:44,239 --> 00:39:47,279
are concerned

1125
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,680
that the

1126
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,280
fisa vaccine by the way of which i took

1127
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:54,239
two shots

1128
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:54,240
no booster yet

1129
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,559
is unsafe

1130
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:59,838
what do you say to people

1131
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,159
that say that

1132
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:03,920
no they should not

1133
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:06,239
fear something like that it's completely

1134
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,240
wrong there is no

1135
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,519
medical product in the history of

1136
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:14,318
humanity that have been tested as much

1137
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:16,800
as this vaccine has been administered to

1138
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:18,000
hundreds of millions of people

1139
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,400
and because

1140
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,280
of the importance of covid they have

1141
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,519
been scrutinized those people

1142
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,400
constantly right now healthcare

1143
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:30,719
authorities are looking for every single

1144
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,318
signal around the world of people that

1145
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,318
they got the vaccine and try to see if

1146
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,880
it is vaccine related or not

1147
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:39,039
there are electronic medical records

1148
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,200
that will tell us

1149
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:42,159
when and what happened to a person when

1150
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:44,318
he did

1151
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:46,399
got the vaccine and

1152
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:49,358
we know now

1153
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:52,318
more we have so high certainty that it

1154
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:55,838
is so safe

1155
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:57,838
exactly as the datasheet

1156
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,039
says about this vaccine more than any

1157
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:00,559
other product

1158
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:03,199
they should not be afraid of something

1159
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:05,199
like that and they should not listen

1160
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:08,078
to

1161
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:10,399
information but it is misinformation but

1162
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,280
it is spread on purpose

1163
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,760
well

1164
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,319
i don't like the word misinformation

1165
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:21,119
because

1166
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:22,800
you know again back to the soviet union

1167
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,640
anyone who opposes the state is

1168
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,000
spreading misinformation

1169
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,318
so you can basically call anything

1170
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,760
misinformation that's the unfortunate

1171
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,119
times we live in

1172
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,359
is

1173
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:35,358
you can call anyone you can basically

1174
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,119
call anybody a liar and say i'm the sole

1175
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,358
possessor of the truth

1176
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,838
and just no offense to me just because

1177
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:43,519
you wear a tie doesn't mean you're

1178
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:46,239
any more likely to be in the possession

1179
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:48,079
of the truth than anyone else so i

1180
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,358
wouldn't disagree with that at all i

1181
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:50,400
don't think that that's somebody who's

1182
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:52,480
not wearing it

1183
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:54,400
and as you can people can see that i'm

1184
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,000
not wearing a tie and you are

1185
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,599
but it's not about um

1186
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,880
being able those that they have the

1187
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,440
power

1188
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,720
to to impose on the others the stigma

1189
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,079
that

1190
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,679
you what you are saying is

1191
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,280
misinformation

1192
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:13,838
but there are few things that the

1193
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,440
society we have accomplished and science

1194
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:16,639
is one of them

1195
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,679
and

1196
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:18,559
data

1197
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,199
is

1198
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:23,679
and analytics of data is another one

1199
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,358
and to say that

1200
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:27,279
something

1201
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:30,318
which is highly scientific by people

1202
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,119
that they are not scientists

1203
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:34,239
i

1204
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:36,800
i think that it is not what you are

1205
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:40,000
describing what used to happen in soviet

1206
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,400
union or in any other autocratic

1207
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,960
regime in the world right now but i

1208
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:47,838
definitely do think

1209
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,760
that uh the scientists the public

1210
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,318
science communicators i've listened to

1211
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:55,119
over covet have really disappointed me

1212
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:57,519
because they have not

1213
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,119
spoken with empathy they haven't

1214
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:02,000
sufficiently in my view have put their

1215
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,240
ego aside and really listen to people

1216
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,440
yes people that don't have a phd people

1217
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,399
have not

1218
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,679
really

1219
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,680
you know

1220
00:43:07,679 --> 00:43:11,358
maybe not even taken like a biology

1221
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:14,318
course in college or something like that

1222
00:43:11,358 --> 00:43:17,199
but still they they they have children

1223
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:20,239
they they worry they fear

1224
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:22,639
they don't know who to trust they don't

1225
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:25,039
know if they should listen to the ceo of

1226
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,838
pfizer who might have other incentives

1227
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:30,079
in mind who might just care about money

1228
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:32,078
and nothing else and so

1229
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,480
they just use common sense and they ask

1230
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,760
questions and i think to them talking

1231
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,920
down to them as if they're not

1232
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,359
intelligent so on is something

1233
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,800
scientists have done

1234
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,358
almost like rolled their eyes and that

1235
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,519
disappoints me because i think that's

1236
00:43:43,358 --> 00:43:48,960
kind of what's is the source of division

1237
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:51,519
look humility is a virtue yes and

1238
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,000
yes the fact that you are educated

1239
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,000
doesn't mean that you are having either

1240
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,599
humility or empathy

1241
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,159
or you have good

1242
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,079
human qualities this was never

1243
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:06,318
and will never be

1244
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:08,560
a metric of judging this type of virtues

1245
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:10,719
those that they do this

1246
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:12,639
they're wrong and actually

1247
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:14,639
they they are not

1248
00:44:12,639 --> 00:44:16,000
doing good service to the public health

1249
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:19,118
because they are undermining people

1250
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,920
aren't stupid they see if you're not

1251
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:21,760
be

1252
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,358
respecting them and if you are not

1253
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,720
respecting their need

1254
00:44:23,358 --> 00:44:26,159
to learn because that affects their

1255
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:28,480
health the health of the mother of the

1256
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,679
kids so i fully agree with you that we

1257
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,800
should be

1258
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,598
very

1259
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,800
patient to explain again and again and

1260
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,200
again

1261
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,640
what is happening and the vast majority

1262
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:40,000
of the people that they don't get

1263
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,920
vaccinations right now is because

1264
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,920
they're afraid it's not for any other

1265
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,800
reason it's not that they have a an

1266
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,800
agenda what i'm saying it is there is a

1267
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:51,280
small number of people

1268
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,720
that they have make business

1269
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:53,180
for them

1270
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:54,399
to

1271
00:44:53,179 --> 00:44:57,039
[Music]

1272
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,200
profit from this anxiety i'll give you

1273
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,920
an example

1274
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:03,439
i have been arrested by fbi this is what

1275
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,559
someone wrote

1276
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,519
i i read it i laughed i mean

1277
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:09,199
okay

1278
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,079
this is where they take it there was a

1279
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,598
reason why they wrote that the files you

1280
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,318
always are fbi because they want to

1281
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,960
create doubts in the minds of the people

1282
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,400
that they're afraid and say look if fdi

1283
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,720
arrested him likely i will not do the

1284
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,200
vaccine but i laughed

1285
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:27,919
a week later

1286
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:29,519
the wife of the physical ceo

1287
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,680
died

1288
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:33,838
there is a picture in this website of my

1289
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:33,838
wife

1290
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,960
someone sends to me

1291
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,318
now i'm pissed i'm not laughing i try to

1292
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,000
find my kids

1293
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,000
to tell them if you read something mom

1294
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,639
is fine don't worry

1295
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,679
then i remember that she has

1296
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:51,759
very old parents back in greece we start

1297
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:53,118
calling them to making sure because we

1298
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,200
know that that will be picked up by

1299
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:57,838
greek newspapers and they will publish

1300
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:59,919
it okay they are those people that wrote

1301
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:03,119
these things they know very well that my

1302
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,800
wife didn't die and died because she was

1303
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,440
vaccinated right

1304
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:08,800
so this is the narratives that they are

1305
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,000
on purpose

1306
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,079
forming

1307
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,119
to profit

1308
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,000
from

1309
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,640
the stress and

1310
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,800
the anxiety of good people and that's

1311
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:22,400
something i have to kind of people that

1312
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,560
listen to this that kind of dialed

1313
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:27,440
institutions

1314
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:29,039
i do also want to say that there's

1315
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,400
quite a few folks

1316
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:32,960
who realize they can make money

1317
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,240
from

1318
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,358
[Music]

1319
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,679
saying

1320
00:46:35,358 --> 00:46:40,159
the man is lying to you

1321
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,318
the government is lying to you

1322
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,559
it's all corrupt

1323
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:46,239
it's all a scam

1324
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,239
big farmer is lying to you they're

1325
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,159
manipulating you

1326
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,519
i'm surprised that how much money can be

1327
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,000
made with that

1328
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:56,400
and it's sad so you have to just as

1329
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,358
people use their common sense

1330
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,599
to uh be skeptical when listening to

1331
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,199
politicians and powerful figures they

1332
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,519
should be skeptical

1333
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,679
to also when listening to sort of the

1334
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,199
the conspiracy theorists or not even the

1335
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,679
conspiracy theorists but people who

1336
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:14,559
raise questions about institutions

1337
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:16,318
think think on your own think critically

1338
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,719
with an open mind

1339
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,358
that everyone can be manipulating

1340
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:22,558
you but also everybody has the capacity

1341
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:26,078
to do good

1342
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:29,519
and i think uh science in its pure form

1343
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,119
not when entangled institutions

1344
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:33,599
is a beautiful thing

1345
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:36,480
and in the hands of many companies it is

1346
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,760
a beautiful thing at scale

1347
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,000
still

1348
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:42,800
you have a lot of incentive as having

1349
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,679
created the vaccine advisor this

1350
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,800
incredible technology

1351
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,598
to uh

1352
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,559
sing it praises

1353
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:54,480
so that there's a kind of you know

1354
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,760
people are skeptical like how much do we

1355
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,920
trust

1356
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,960
how excited

1357
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:04,000
uh albert is about this vaccine so for

1358
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,318
example i mean not to do a shakespearean

1359
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,440
analysis of your twitter but i think you

1360
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:12,318
tweeted something about a study with a

1361
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,920
100 efficacy of the vaccine or in

1362
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:15,920
stopping a transmission or something

1363
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,880
like that

1364
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,559
do you regret

1365
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,599
uh sort of

1366
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,519
being

1367
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:25,359
uh like over representing the

1368
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,440
effectiveness of the vaccine technically

1369
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:29,598
saying correct things

1370
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,559
but just kind of like

1371
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:34,480
highlighting the super positive things

1372
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,559
that may be misinterpreted

1373
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,079
you know saying a hundred percent no i

1374
00:48:36,559 --> 00:48:40,400
never said something hundred percent

1375
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,318
that every time i speak if a number is

1376
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,480
hundred percent i rushed to say that in

1377
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:46,000
biology there is nothing hundred percent

1378
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:48,240
because always there will be when you go

1379
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,559
to the millions okay they were in the

1380
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:53,199
study things that were 100 for example

1381
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,280
deaths or in south africa yeah when we

1382
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:56,480
tried it there was a hundred percent

1383
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,480
efficacy

1384
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,440
clearly in small numbers when the

1385
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,519
numbers will become much bigger the 100

1386
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,760
will not hold but will be 95 96 so still

1387
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,358
the direction of this is the point so

1388
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,079
i'm very very careful

1389
00:49:09,358 --> 00:49:13,519
how i what i treat and

1390
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,280
in addition to

1391
00:49:13,519 --> 00:49:18,880
how careful i am i have people that

1392
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,720
they are looking at and they are having

1393
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,880
second or third opinions to make sure

1394
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:24,558
that we don't put why because i know

1395
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,160
that people are listening to me right

1396
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,319
now everything i say

1397
00:49:26,159 --> 00:49:31,199
and i want to make sure that they

1398
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:33,440
continue not only

1399
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:35,759
not only being clear as to what i want

1400
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,838
to say so there are no misunderstandings

1401
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,319
but also i maintain the trust

1402
00:49:37,838 --> 00:49:43,039
of the people i don't think that

1403
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:46,000
someone who only there picks information

1404
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:48,318
and only emphasizes positive things it's

1405
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:52,000
someone that it is the one to be trusted

1406
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:54,239
and i want me and pfizer to be trusted

1407
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,519
so many felt the vaccine was presented

1408
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:57,358
as a cure

1409
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:58,559
that wouldn't require regular booster

1410
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,799
shots

1411
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,480
was that something you believed early on

1412
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,720
did you always believe that many regular

1413
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:06,960
shots would be required it may be in a

1414
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,399
bigger picture how many

1415
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,720
do you think this will

1416
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,039
for the fisa vaccine is it something you

1417
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:14,959
see that's taking uh a booster shot

1418
00:50:13,039 --> 00:50:16,639
regularly like annually

1419
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,358
yes in the beginning when we had the

1420
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:21,358
first months of the vaccine people would

1421
00:50:19,358 --> 00:50:24,159
ask me do we need another one and i said

1422
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:26,078
we don't know i was very clear about it

1423
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:28,879
then around april may i started seeing

1424
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:31,760
the first data and i made statements

1425
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,079
that i think we will need a booster

1426
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,400
around 8 to 12 months after the second

1427
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,880
dose and then after that annual

1428
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,720
revaccinations this is what i said

1429
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,318
believe is the one of the most likely

1430
00:50:40,719 --> 00:50:44,239
scenarios

1431
00:50:42,318 --> 00:50:46,000
and it was based on the data that i had

1432
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:48,159
but then delta came

1433
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,000
and because i always making the

1434
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:52,000
the caveat that with

1435
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,719
absent and uvaria with everything we

1436
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,880
know

1437
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:56,959
with delta it was proven that we need

1438
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,599
the booster to move to the three to the

1439
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,559
six months and this is what

1440
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:01,599
happened

1441
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,680
and uh

1442
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:05,680
i still said i think

1443
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:07,118
the booster is six months and then i

1444
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:09,598
think it will be an annual

1445
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:11,519
re-vaccination likely we have to monitor

1446
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:12,720
to see the data but this is the likely

1447
00:51:11,519 --> 00:51:14,960
scenario

1448
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:17,279
now we have omega

1449
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,199
and omegran says that the

1450
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,640
two doses might be challenging we don't

1451
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:24,879
know exactly yet but three doses work

1452
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:27,358
so clearly a lot of countries already

1453
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,680
started moving now the third dose

1454
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,519
not in six from six months to three

1455
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:34,159
so that they will

1456
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:34,960
reduce the period that people will not

1457
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:37,679
be

1458
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:39,679
protected with uh with

1459
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:43,199
the third dose

1460
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:45,279
i don't know with omikron if how long

1461
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:47,679
this will last and frankly i don't know

1462
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,760
if we will need a new vaccine taylormade

1463
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:50,879
to omicron based on everything we know

1464
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,119
so far

1465
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,559
we are monitoring and to know way more

1466
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:56,640
in the weeks to come

1467
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,079
if there is a need for a new vaccine we

1468
00:51:56,639 --> 00:51:59,679
will have it

1469
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,318
and if there is a need for mass

1470
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:04,480
production of this new vaccine

1471
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:06,639
i can also feel very comfortable that we

1472
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,480
will not lose any of our capacity that

1473
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:09,358
we have developed right now we are

1474
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,480
running

1475
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:14,159
at one billion almost approximately

1476
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:15,599
doses per quarter

1477
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:17,519
four per year

1478
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:19,359
and if we have to switch

1479
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,199
and have half of that in the new half of

1480
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:23,598
that in the old we will do still four

1481
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,598
billion dollars so i think the world

1482
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:28,000
should feel very very

1483
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:30,400
comfortable but if there is a need we

1484
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,639
will be ahead of the virus yeah he did

1485
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,119
uh he delivered or produced three

1486
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:37,279
billion this year vaccines and you're on

1487
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,079
track to do four billion next year yeah

1488
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:42,160
i mean if we had uh

1489
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,519
uh a lot more time we would talk about

1490
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:45,920
how the heck you achieved that kind of

1491
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:48,480
scale it's truly incredible

1492
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:50,159
let me ask the policy question

1493
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:51,920
what are your feelings about vaccine

1494
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,759
mandates

1495
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,720
in terms of

1496
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,040
do you think the most effective way to

1497
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:01,199
vaccinate the population is to acquire

1498
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:02,719
it or

1499
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:05,039
do

1500
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,279
you go with the american way and give

1501
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:08,558
people the freedom to choose

1502
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:10,880
i think it is

1503
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:13,200
a very difficult

1504
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,440
topic in a very difficult decision who

1505
00:53:13,199 --> 00:53:17,519
whoever needs to make it and clearly

1506
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,200
it's not me it is the public health

1507
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,440
officials of every country that they

1508
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:23,439
have to make this decision i have to

1509
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,559
make the decision for files

1510
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,559
employees

1511
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:27,599
and i had to

1512
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,960
to

1513
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,800
balance

1514
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,800
the fear of those

1515
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,200
that they work that they want to feel

1516
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:36,640
that the others are vaccinated and the

1517
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:39,598
fear of those that they don't want to

1518
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:42,078
get the vaccine and eventually i came to

1519
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:44,160
the decision that we will mandate

1520
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:46,000
advice we are flexible we are giving

1521
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:47,838
exceptions of course for health maybe

1522
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:49,199
some religions

1523
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:52,078
but

1524
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:54,799
we decided to to mandate it now

1525
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:57,440
at pfizer we when we did this decision

1526
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,760
we were at 90 vaccination rates when we

1527
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,119
said we are going to mandate it

1528
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,680
and that

1529
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,880
took it up to 96.

1530
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:06,318
it works

1531
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,960
right

1532
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:11,679
this 10 percent was never going to move

1533
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,440
i felt because no matter what you have a

1534
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:14,480
small number of people that really are

1535
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,559
scared

1536
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,358
and they don't feel comfortable to do it

1537
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,319
okay

1538
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:22,159
it worked in our case we took it to 96

1539
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:24,239
i'm happy for those people

1540
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:25,358
a lot we're not disease and some will

1541
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:27,118
not die

1542
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:30,239
of of the of those people but it's not

1543
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,559
to me to say because the debate

1544
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:34,479
uh it's serious debate

1545
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,400
and there are a lot of pros and cons if

1546
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:40,719
you need to push people if you need to

1547
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:42,798
give them the freedom uh and uh

1548
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:45,279
it's comes with a territory if you are

1549
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:47,199
elected to run a country

1550
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:48,640
you should be ready to make difficult

1551
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:50,000
decisions and no matter what decision

1552
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:51,279
you make there will be fake stories

1553
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,199
written about you as we talked about

1554
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,040
arrows you will not be able to please

1555
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:57,838
everyone yes

1556
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,599
uh well let me just say that i think

1557
00:54:57,838 --> 00:55:01,440
again coming from the soviet union i

1558
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:04,880
think at the public level at the federal

1559
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,559
level mandates is um

1560
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,720
it's a really bad idea

1561
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,000
even even if it's good for the health of

1562
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:11,759
the populace

1563
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,119
um there's something about preserving

1564
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,920
the freedom is really powerful about

1565
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,559
this country in like doing the hard work

1566
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:21,358
of convincing people to get vaccinated

1567
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,599
to choose to get vaccinated if they want

1568
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:25,598
but still have the freedom not to that's

1569
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:28,318
a really powerful freedom

1570
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:31,039
to me it's super lazy to mandate

1571
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:34,838
people should understand the science

1572
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,838
and want to get vaccinated

1573
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:41,358
do you think children need to get

1574
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,280
vaccinated

1575
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:44,480
i do i do think that they need to get

1576
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,280
vaccinated

1577
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:48,798
so

1578
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:50,720
age ranges 5 to 16

1579
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:51,699
there's a lot of parents

1580
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:53,279
that um

1581
00:55:51,699 --> 00:55:54,960
[Music]

1582
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:56,000
that fear for the well-being of their

1583
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,079
children

1584
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,199
can you empathize with those parents can

1585
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,440
you

1586
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:02,558
steal man their arguments against the

1587
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,000
vaccine

1588
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,240
for their children

1589
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,000
you know because people know who i am i

1590
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:08,959
had the opportunity

1591
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,400
to

1592
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,760
to

1593
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,798
interact with parents before that was

1594
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:18,880
let's say

1595
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:20,559
approved and there were so many way more

1596
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:22,240
that

1597
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,440
i had a lot of empathy because they were

1598
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:24,798
afraid

1599
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:26,639
for their kids because they didn't have

1600
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:28,239
a vaccine

1601
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,039
and they were the ones that were

1602
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:32,959
speaking at that time bring me vaccine

1603
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:35,279
when are you going to bring me vaccine i

1604
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,358
really fear i feel that this is unfair

1605
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:40,079
but i'm protected my husband is

1606
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:42,798
protected my old son is protected and my

1607
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,519
little sweetheart because he's below the

1608
00:56:42,798 --> 00:56:47,759
age is not protected

1609
00:56:45,519 --> 00:56:48,719
now that we have the vaccines i'm sure

1610
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,000
that

1611
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:51,919
those that they are afraid of the

1612
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,280
vaccine not of the disease which are

1613
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,159
smaller number

1614
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:57,839
admittedly also they will have

1615
00:56:56,159 --> 00:57:00,000
if they are afraid of them i'm sure they

1616
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:01,599
were afraid even more about their kids

1617
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,960
because they love

1618
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,000
i would say more than they love

1619
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,039
themselves

1620
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,719
so it's going to be this situation and

1621
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:10,239
again the same

1622
00:57:08,719 --> 00:57:12,558
how can we do

1623
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,919
to demonstrate to convince people to win

1624
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,359
the minds and the hearts of the people

1625
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:16,639
that this is the right thing to do what

1626
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:19,440
do you think about that calculation

1627
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:22,159
because the risk for kids is very low

1628
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:23,679
kids do die kids do go to the hospital

1629
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:25,598
from covid yes

1630
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:29,838
but the rate is very low

1631
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:32,000
the rate is lower but kids they do die

1632
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:34,639
and how can you say that i'm not going

1633
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,880
to i'm not going to protect a kid for

1634
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:39,039
something that it is likely to happen

1635
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:41,599
and it is not only that what happens in

1636
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:44,719
the school when they stop the education

1637
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,559
process because a kid got the disease

1638
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:49,439
and they don't have vaccines so that

1639
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:52,480
they can control it is such a big

1640
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,358
disruption and such a big risk

1641
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,719
for

1642
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:57,199
for the health

1643
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:01,598
of of the of the

1644
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:05,679
kids that it shouldn't be a debate look

1645
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,680
how many kids are having polio right now

1646
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,719
well

1647
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,280
fewer number than those that they're

1648
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:14,000
having covered in in the hospital

1649
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,960
but everybody's getting the vaccine

1650
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,920
it's um well polio was deadlier for kids

1651
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,838
but it's not now so why some a kid to do

1652
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,159
it

1653
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:26,000
now because needs to be protected well

1654
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:28,239
the unique thing about the covet vaccine

1655
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,639
is a new type of technology too so

1656
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:30,719
there's an extra concern

1657
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,358
[Music]

1658
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:35,199
choosing to vaccinate a child

1659
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:37,598
you're making a choice that can

1660
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:39,358
potentially hurt them

1661
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,519
that's the way parents that are hesitant

1662
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:43,759
about the vaccine think

1663
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:46,960
i think choosing to vaccinate

1664
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,799
children makes a choice

1665
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,400
so that something could not potentially

1666
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:53,920
hurt them which is the disease that's

1667
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,880
why we are doing vaccinations since ever

1668
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,400
i

1669
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,000
know that

1670
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,400
there are people that they are concerned

1671
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:02,880
for themselves and for their kids

1672
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,680
what i know it is

1673
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,880
that i'm a scientist and i'm a parent

1674
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:09,519
and

1675
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,358
i am telling you that vaccines is a very

1676
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:14,239
good thing for kids and thank god we

1677
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:14,239
were able to develop

1678
00:59:14,719 --> 00:59:17,838
so we've talked quite a bit about the

1679
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:20,000
vaccine but there's an incredible new

1680
00:59:17,838 --> 00:59:22,558
technology that pfizer is developing

1681
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,079
with the paxlovid the antiviral for

1682
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,240
covid

1683
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:28,480
where does that stand

1684
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:31,519
how does that work

1685
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:33,280
um and how are you able to develop

1686
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,440
in four months

1687
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:37,280
like you said and all of that in just a

1688
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,679
few minutes

1689
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:41,839
first of all what this is about this is

1690
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:44,318
a real game changer

1691
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:46,480
this is a course of treatment that you

1692
00:59:44,318 --> 00:59:48,159
get only if you get the disease you get

1693
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,719
covered

1694
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:53,920
then what happens is that you will take

1695
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:56,480
for five days pills day and night

1696
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:58,240
and twice a day for five days

1697
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:00,798
and instead of ten people from those

1698
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:02,318
that dies is to go to hospital only one

1699
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:04,960
will go

1700
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:07,199
this is an end

1701
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,960
with all the caveats that the numbers

1702
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:12,078
are small no one died it was a hundred

1703
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:13,358
percent efficacy on deaths of course i'm

1704
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,280
sure that

1705
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:17,358
in real world when the numbers are

1706
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:20,240
getting very high we may have

1707
01:00:17,358 --> 01:00:22,159
99 instead of 100 but

1708
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:24,159
these are spectacular

1709
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:25,759
results for something that you can take

1710
01:00:24,159 --> 01:00:28,318
home and stay home

1711
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:30,400
the biggest problem right now in europe

1712
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:32,159
in the u.s when we have surges every

1713
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:33,358
time that we have a search

1714
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,798
of

1715
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:39,679
of covet it is that the icus are full

1716
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:40,719
the hospitals are paralyzed they have to

1717
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:42,558
postpone

1718
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:44,959
electric surgeries they have to postpone

1719
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:47,200
other operations because they don't have

1720
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,720
the capacity because of that keeping

1721
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:52,139
people out

1722
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:53,598
of the hospitals home keeping people

1723
01:00:52,139 --> 01:00:55,679
[Music]

1724
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:59,039
without dying

1725
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:01,838
it is something i didn't have before

1726
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:03,679
and this is a significant significant

1727
01:01:01,838 --> 01:01:05,199
game changer

1728
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:08,960
i have to ask

1729
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:11,838
a controversial difficult question

1730
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,240
what are your thoughts about ivermectin

1731
01:01:11,838 --> 01:01:15,920
has it sufficiently been studied has

1732
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:17,598
faisal considered it

1733
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,838
in its like i said incredible

1734
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:22,079
development of the antiviral

1735
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:22,798
um as like as a comparator that kind of

1736
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:25,359
thing

1737
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:26,639
just investigated in general the reason

1738
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:29,519
i bring it up

1739
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:31,440
because i've read quite a few criticisms

1740
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:34,318
of people there's been some comparisons

1741
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,079
of pax love with ivermectin and i think

1742
01:01:34,318 --> 01:01:38,480
people should look up

1743
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,400
there is dr john campbell that describes

1744
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:41,838
that comparison and makes that claim and

1745
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,400
there's quite a lot of people that

1746
01:01:41,838 --> 01:01:46,159
debunk or argue against that

1747
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:47,280
you can do your own research

1748
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:48,798
but

1749
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:52,480
there's a lot of people that kind of see

1750
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:55,038
this free drug without patents on it and

1751
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:57,119
say this could be the savior so can you

1752
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,799
just speak to that comparison and it's

1753
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:01,838
not the first time if you remember there

1754
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:03,599
were other compounds that were claimed

1755
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:05,838
that they are

1756
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:06,559
the

1757
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:09,679
the

1758
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:11,280
solution and to cover it and uh

1759
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:12,399
clearly they were proven that they are

1760
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,359
not

1761
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:14,559
there are compounds that there are

1762
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:15,358
solutions and composites that they're

1763
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:17,440
not

1764
01:02:15,358 --> 01:02:19,038
i as a scientist

1765
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,200
and i discuss with our scientists they

1766
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,920
don't see any

1767
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:25,838
reason why a medicine like ever

1768
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:28,559
marketing which is a parasitic site to

1769
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:30,639
be able to act on covet

1770
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,319
and so they don't think that

1771
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:33,759
there's any connection and they haven't

1772
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:35,920
seen any

1773
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,240
paper that describes someone that used

1774
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,000
it that had any results i'm sure that

1775
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:41,759
there will be some people that will

1776
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,798
claim because people are claiming

1777
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,599
anything

1778
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,639
but

1779
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,480
i don't think that there was any paper

1780
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:50,558
in any peer review

1781
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:53,519
magazine and a reliable scientific

1782
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:55,440
magazine to to support this claim so we

1783
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,880
are focusing on

1784
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,480
saving people's lives we are not

1785
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,640
focusing on

1786
01:02:58,480 --> 01:03:00,639
on

1787
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:07,199
craziness well the to push back there is

1788
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:08,879
quite a lot of papers but the studies

1789
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:10,399
are small so that so there's no

1790
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,880
conclusive evidence in this i haven't

1791
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:15,920
seen any that it is reliable right i

1792
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:18,559
don't know where are these small or big

1793
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:21,280
reliable i haven't seen any right well

1794
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:23,119
some of the big ones have been retracted

1795
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,480
which means they weren't

1796
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:27,760
legitimate yes yeah so uh

1797
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:29,440
you know so this is definitely something

1798
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:30,559
that people need to look and the people

1799
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,760
that kind of

1800
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,200
question

1801
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,440
all the effectiveness i've ever met and

1802
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:37,199
definitely um something to think about

1803
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,159
and i think it's the reason that

1804
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:42,399
pakistan was chloroquinol before yes

1805
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:45,440
for god's sake that's why how many

1806
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:47,760
people died because of that

1807
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:49,760
yeah this is the the this is this is the

1808
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,760
dangerous thing this is the sad thing

1809
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:53,280
yeah

1810
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,680
slovak has been studying thousands of

1811
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:57,359
people and will be under the scrutiny

1812
01:03:55,679 --> 01:04:00,078
not only of uh

1813
01:03:57,358 --> 01:04:01,759
regulators but as we will go into the

1814
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,519
implementation as it happened in many

1815
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,440
countries they will monitor to see

1816
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:07,599
what's happening with let's say that

1817
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,920
whatever with one cities out there

1818
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:11,359
within a few weeks they will know all

1819
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,760
hospitals if it works or not because

1820
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:15,598
they will see the statistics

1821
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:19,200
we've gone through

1822
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,960
uh one of the more difficult periods

1823
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,439
in recent human history over the past

1824
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:26,240
two years like as a society what gives

1825
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:29,280
you what gives you hope about the future

1826
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:32,000
for our human civilization

1827
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:34,000
you look into the next few years i think

1828
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,719
the human ingenuity

1829
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,039
i think although there is

1830
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:41,038
the world always is progressing

1831
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,640
although there are a lot of things that

1832
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:45,760
need to be fixed

1833
01:04:42,639 --> 01:04:48,400
in the society of 2020.

1834
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,680
the site of 2020 is better

1835
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,079
at large

1836
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:54,879
than things 50 years back

1837
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:56,318
100 years back in all different aspects

1838
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,079
from poverty

1839
01:04:56,318 --> 01:04:59,199
for human rights

1840
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:01,920
from

1841
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:06,399
from science from quality of life from

1842
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:06,400
any aspect i am positive that

1843
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:12,000
humans can create and always create a

1844
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,160
better future and we'll continue doing

1845
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,159
so

1846
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,639
you have helped save the lives of

1847
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:20,880
millions of people help improve the

1848
01:05:18,639 --> 01:05:24,000
quality of their lives but you yourself

1849
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,920
are just one biological organism

1850
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:28,000
with an expiration date

1851
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,480
do you ponder your mortality

1852
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,719
do you uh think about your death are you

1853
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,119
afraid of death

1854
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:37,038
that's a very interesting question i

1855
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,720
i was discussing with a lot of people

1856
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,920
that i was fearless of death i couldn't

1857
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:41,759
care less

1858
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:44,159
when i was young

1859
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:47,599
the first thing the first time

1860
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:49,838
that i started feeling that i want to be

1861
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,920
around was when i had kids

1862
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:53,440
and then i started feeling that

1863
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,358
oh gosh is it

1864
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,000
i hope i will be around to see their

1865
01:05:55,358 --> 01:06:00,480
wedding i hope they will be around to

1866
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,639
see their their children so

1867
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,240
if there is something that scares me the

1868
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:06,159
possibility i will not be part of their

1869
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:08,798
lives anymore and i would not be

1870
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:10,480
watching i hope there is life upstairs

1871
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,519
so i will be able to watch them from

1872
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,519
there

1873
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:19,119
from upstairs get a nice overview

1874
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:20,960
let me ask the big ridiculous question

1875
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,798
and you only have two minutes

1876
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,559
or less to answer it

1877
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,159
what is the meaning of life what's the

1878
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:27,920
meaning of this whole thing you said

1879
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:28,798
ingenuity is the thing that gives you

1880
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,798
hope

1881
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,079
we seem to be all busy trying to help

1882
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:34,318
each other trying to build a better

1883
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:37,200
world why are we doing that

1884
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:39,920
i would repeat something that

1885
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:42,639
steve jobs has said death is

1886
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:45,680
life's biggest invention

1887
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:47,519
it eliminates the old and gives place to

1888
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:49,598
the new

1889
01:06:47,519 --> 01:06:51,519
life is all about

1890
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,160
moving forward

1891
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,280
life is all about

1892
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:56,719
creating

1893
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,680
new things

1894
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,879
maybe

1895
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:02,798
everyone is a contributor but no one is

1896
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:05,039
the owner

1897
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:06,159
and always creating something new

1898
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:07,599
always

1899
01:07:06,159 --> 01:07:10,318
adding something beautiful into the

1900
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:11,519
world maybe a little bit of love

1901
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:13,199
