00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:59,679
away with the first daylight of reality

27
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:01,679
so uh mark norman let me first ask you

28
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:02,878
about love uh

29
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:04,400
what are your thoughts about love you

30
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,198
talk about your relationships quite a

31
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,600
bit

32
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:09,438
do you think love can last

33
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,280
i do

34
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:12,399
but i think it's work everybody wants

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,759
love to be this

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,920
pre-packaged perfect euphoric thing but

37
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,478
it you gotta

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,159
it's like a good body you know we're all

39
00:01:20,478 --> 00:01:24,239
born with a good body but you gotta keep

40
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,759
it in shape and it's the same with a

41
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:28,079
loving relationship

42
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,079
i think you uh nobody wants to do the

43
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,078
work that's the problem

44
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,319
you talked about i think you told a

45
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,759
story about being unfaithful to a

46
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:36,559
previous girlfriend or something like

47
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,519
that

48
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,680
i think the story goes that

49
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:43,200
you were like drifting apart who are you

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,960
talking to bert crusher maybe or

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
something like that yeah

52
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:48,640
high school sweethearts dated for like

53
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,159
12 years and then

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,759
so that wasn't love anymore that was

55
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,920
more like relation that was like it was

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,920
comfort it was routine and uh we just

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,359
slipped into that kind of married life

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,840
autopilot

59
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,680
world and uh

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,320
i tried to break up i think and it

61
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,159
didn't take it was one of those things

62
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,359
our lives were just so

63
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,000
baked in

64
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:11,759
and then i think i uh cheated and she

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,439
caught me and it was ugly and then we

66
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,679
went to therapy to try to work it out

67
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,598
but it's it's much like a car that gets

68
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,640
into a wreck the door just never closed

69
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:20,959
the same

70
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:23,359
you know what i mean yeah so what are

71
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,598
your thoughts about then um commitment

72
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,599
like outside of love marriage

73
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,479
i think it's an antiquated idea i think

74
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,839
it's kind of silly and unrealistic

75
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,479
and i think we're coming out of that as

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,239
we get all polyamorous and non-binary

77
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,119
and queefy and all this stuff i think

78
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,200
we're

79
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,280
slowly moving away from that but uh i

80
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,919
think a lot of the ladies

81
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,199
more majority women like marriage like

82
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,679
the idea of it

83
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,238
like i'm i'm i'm a fiance now or

84
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,040
whatever you call it i'm engaged and i

85
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,439
mean she is just

86
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:57,840
going hog wild she's loving it she's got

87
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,639
the dress thing pick a venue flow and

88
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,400
she's

89
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:01,919
she's deep in whereas i feel guilty

90
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,840

164
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:40,959

166
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:44,079

00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,560
nature a little bit for sure you go wow

188
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,318
annoying am i pissing this guy off but

189
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,638
what a way to live just

190
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,000
i want the bike i'm taking it [ __ ] his

191
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,879
feelings

192
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,120
for me that quickly turned into um

193
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:37,279
realizing that that's just a temporary

194
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,120
phase that those folks are in like they

195
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,758
there's a they have a capacity to be

196
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,918
good sure for some reason

197
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:47,120
for me that was a motivation to see can

198
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:49,359
we discover can can we incentivize

199
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,439
them to find like a better path in life

200
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,360
like i i wasn't like all like

201
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:55,038
i don't know gandhi about it you know of

202
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
course i was pissed and all those kinds

203
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:59,120
of things but

204
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,919
i don't know it seemed

205
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,519
like

206
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,519
just the kind of thing

207
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:05,839
you might do when you're younger yeah

208
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:07,598
hope what is adult

209
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,679
crime obviously

210
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,000
yeah i know but yeah exactly and then it

211
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
solidifies and then you're beyond saving

212
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,639
at some point but it's like there's

213
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,680
always

214
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,598
there's always an opportunity to uh

215
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,519
to make a better uh

216
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,598
life for yourself to to become a better

217
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,839
version of yourself yeah and i remember

218
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,079
coming home crying with no bike and my

219
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,079
mom she's my parents are like

220
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,680
liberal to a fault yeah you know where

221
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,519
they were like oh well they need it

222
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,598
they're poor kids in the neighborhood

223
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:37,839
you're like all right but i i also like

224
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,199
i have a bicycle that uh i ride around

225
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:40,719
you know and i also like to live in an

226
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,879
area that's not just

227
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,400
you know riddled with uh theft and

228
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,839
vandalism but

229
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,519
they were like oh they need it and then

230
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,439
it was it was a moot point we just moved

231
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,279
on so i remember very young being like

232
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,160
all right i gotta figure my [ __ ] out

233
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,878
okay

234
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
so

235
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,160
you said you were beat up quite a bit

236
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,918
like bullying and stuff pushed around i

237
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,759
was never hospitalized or anything but

238
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,079
you know you get a black guy here and

239
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,759
there and a bloody nose stuff like that

240
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,519
and it was just the outnumbered thing

241
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,800
the violence didn't really

242
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,478
bother me because you're just kids

243
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,560
you're boys yeah but it was the

244
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:15,918
predatory let's get him you know we can

245
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,918
take him down

246
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:22,000
he's you know he's an easy target that's

247
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,000
what kills you yeah the mental part

248
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,038
yeah you know until you actually said i

249
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,199
didn't realize i've been in what do you

250
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,038
call them scuffles

251
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,200
and uh there's just one that stands out

252
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,479
to me where yeah let's hear it fatty

253
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,560
bring it on

254
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,320
and you do jujitsu and all that stuff

255
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,639
right yeah you can see the guns through

256
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,719
the suit you're like john wick all right

257
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:43,918
uh all right well i used to have now

258
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,519
you're gonna start making fun of me i

259
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,120
used to have long hair for for like a

260
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,440
couple years i was in a band playing

261
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,759
music and stuff like that and there was

262
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,680
um like most of the fights i've been in

263
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,958
were basically one-on-one maybe a little

264
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,399
bit like

265
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:58,879
a little

266
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,519
extra stuff but not outnumbered and this

267
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:03,600
one particular time

268
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:04,879
i've learned a lot of lessons but one of

269
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,399
them was i

270
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,120
there's the fight started between me and

271
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:12,240
this other person and then

272
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,839
uh his buddies i guess were there uh-oh

273
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,600
and they as opposed to like breaking up

274
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,120
or letting it happen

275
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,360
um one of them grabbed my hair

276
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,759
it's the first time anybody grabbed like

277
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,200
use my hair in a fight which i've

278
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,879
since then realized that that's actually

279
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
a really powerful grip and a powerful

280
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,600
weapon oh very vulnerable of you and

281
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,800
then my uh head got pulled back and they

282
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,040
pulled me down to the guard like i

283
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,599
couldn't do anything so i remember being

284
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,079
exceptionally frustrated yeah like that

285
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,240
was the feeling like i can't do anything

286
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,680
here i'm like trapped

287
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,120
and then they they were just like

288
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,919
kicking me and hitting me and stuff like

289
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,879
that and the outnumbered part of it

290
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,479
um

291
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,278
because i always kind of remember the

292
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,839
trapped part because i just hated from a

293
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:58,080
fighting grappling perspective

294
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,560
how like like the feeling was this isn't

295
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,440
fair yes that's what it is it's a deep

296
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,078
deep unfairness yeah that you just can't

297
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,720
you can't win the mob wins yeah the mob

298
00:10:06,078 --> 00:10:10,319
wins scary stuff and but it makes a mix

299
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,839
of man out of it a weird way that builds

300
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,120
character you realize life isn't fair

301
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,959
early and you

302
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,799
you go on from there yeah so there's

303
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:18,479
something there and look at you today

304
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:20,000
they're probably uh you know eaten out

305
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,720
of a dumpster at a krispy kreme and

306
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,120
you're here got eight podcasts yeah

307
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,440
you're doing great talking to the giant

308
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,360
titans of the industry no i i do

309
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,440
remember returning home that night

310
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,680
i mean that you said you were crying

311
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,880
that's really formative like oh yeah

312
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,039
that's the point in which you get to

313
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,399
decide what do i make of this moment i

314
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,639
mean especially when you're younger

315
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,720
maybe it's not presented to you that way

316
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:44,480
but like some of the greatest people in

317
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,360
history

318
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,360
were

319
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,639
bullied in these kinds of ways and they

320
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,480
made something of themselves in this

321
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,799
moment like bully by life in some kind

322
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,879
of way it's like an opportunity for

323
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:57,199
growth it's um

324
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,278
it's weird but like hardship even in

325
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,120
small doses is like an opportunity for

326
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,639
growth totally i mean look at richard

327
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,000
pryor they say he's labeled as the best

328
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,000
community of all time grew up in a

329
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,958
whorehouse watch his mom get plowed by

330
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,000
these guys in in the middle of

331
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,439
indiana i want to say and uh just who

332
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,278
had a harder life he would suck dick for

333
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,720
drugs all this stuff growing up beat up

334
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:20,159
and uh

335
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,639
then the weird thing is oops sorry

336
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,319
that's my birth control alarm and then

337
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:26,399
the uh the whole world is like trying to

338
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,560
get rid of bullying but we still do

339
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,879
bullying but now it's accepted bullying

340
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,359
it's very strange so you're uh your

341
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:36,639
proponent of uh beating kids up is that

342
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,639
yes and sex with them all right

343
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,799
but no uh

344
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,559
i just think it's part of life and it's

345
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,319
horrible it is it's like rain you gotta

346
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,719
have it look a rainy day is a bummer you

347
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,120
know but you need it and uh i think it's

348
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,480
similar to that

349
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,519
what was your relationship like with

350
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,440
your uh

351
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,120
your mom your dad well what are some

352
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,360
memorable moments with them what did you

353
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,519
learn from them good parents

354
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,680
the giving thoughtful

355
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,240
uh

356
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:07,120
a little out to lunch you know they were

357
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,039
workaholics so there was it was hard to

358
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,039
get a lot out of them and my dad was

359
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,000
kind of an angry dad i think he just had

360
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,919
like a

361
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,078
weird childhood and he's just trying to

362
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,919
make it he's trying to provide but it's

363
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,519
hard and we live in this horrible

364
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,439
neighborhood and we're getting robbed

365
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,519
all the time

366
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,120
um so life was kind of coming down on

367
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,679
him all the time so then he'll take it

368
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,240
out on you or whoever he would snap

369
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,599
but great parents they cared they put us

370
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,879
first

371
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,240
um but there wasn't a lot of

372
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,519
how do you see you know you ever go to a

373
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,440
friend's house as a kid and there's like

374
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,679
a picture of a ski trip and you're like

375
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,480
ski trip what the hell is that about you

376
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,879

377
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,879
it was a lot of that and

378
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,679
smart very smart people but i don't know

379
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:51,360
how well they were at uh socializing so

380
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,519
you never like bonded with them like on

381
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,919
a deep human level like some bonnie but

382
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:58,560
it rarely deep yeah it was just you know

383
00:12:55,919 --> 00:13:01,599
almost co-worker hey cold out

384
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:03,119
huh what it's cold out huh oh yeah like

385
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,519
that kind of stuff yeah yeah yeah yeah i

386
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,959
gotcha get there a little bit but it

387
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,360
my parents and i hope they never saw

388
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,958
this but they would do a thing where my

389
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,278
dad especially would do a thing where he

390
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,119
would uh he knew how to cut you down

391
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,720
right to the bone and so after a while

392
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,879
you're like i'm not gonna interact with

393
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,519
this guy because he he can get you so

394
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,360
well one time we were at a uh like a

395
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,440
thanksgiving some kind of family of

396
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,039
event and all the cousins are there and

397
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,480
i remember i was holding court i was a

398
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:31,039
young boy

399
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,759
finding my comedic legs in this weird

400
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:37,199
tumultuous sea we call a family and i

401
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:39,439
was killing and um my dad comes up and

402
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,000
goes what are you holding court

403
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,360
and i was like ah and i felt like i was

404
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,120
this big i just

405
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
shrunk down he just nailed it because in

406
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,000
my head i'm like i'm holding court look

407
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,360
at me i got the whole room and he goes

408
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,039
what are you what are you holding cord

409
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,320
here yeah like who the hell do you think

410
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:54,000
you are and i was like

411
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,560
he's right i should be holding guard who

412
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,399
the [ __ ] am i i'm nobody so uh

413
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:59,919
stuff like that was he aware that you

414
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,198
think he wasn't he wasn't i don't think

415
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:04,078
he was but

416
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,159
do you do you give um parents a pass

417
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:08,399
when they're unaware

418
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:09,919
of the destructive like is it better

419
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,919
when they're unaware because it seems

420
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,919
like that's the way that's true that's

421
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:15,519
why the way parents often fail is

422
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,159
they're not

423
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,360
intentionally malevolent

424
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,799
they're just like clueless yeah

425
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,320
it's a bittersweet thing cause you're

426
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,000
like well okay he's not malicious he's

427
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,560
not trying to hurt me

428
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,320
but also

429
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,838
he doesn't know he hurt me i don't know

430
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,519
it's it's tough because if he was trying

431
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,279
to hurt you

432
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,759
i guess that would be worse

433
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:40,399
so you're the fully baked

434
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:42,720
mark norman cake at this point uh what

435
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,198
yeah it's a cheap cake

436
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,959
do you uh fruit salad

437
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:49,359
you know the sense of self-worth you

438
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:49,359
mentioned

439
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,000
i think in your comedy there's a sense

440
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,519
like you hate yourself you think

441
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,278
i didn't know if that came through [ __ ]

442
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,000
i was trying to hide that part

443
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:02,399
god damn it i mean when you like in the

444
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,120
privacy of your own mind

445
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,360
are

446
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,078
you able to love yourself or is it

447
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,519
mostly self-hate oh jeez what happened

448
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,000
to this podcast i didn't know it was on

449
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,519
uh mr or dr phil dr phil i thought we

450
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
were going to talk about engineering and

451
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,560
and climate change and

452
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,399
rockets uh we'll get there okay starts

453
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:22,879
with love goes to rockets all right i

454
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,720
like that i like that's a t-shirt

455
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,679
um

456
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,120
i mean like what's the question sorry

457
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:34,638
do i feel love no no like i love myself

458
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,639
yeah yeah so are you um

459
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,560
like this engine of being self-critical

460
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,240
of just being constantly anxious

461
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,838
about how the world perceives you these

462
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,079
kinds of things

463
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,160
is this something that you just go to

464
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:50,000
for for comedy or is this

465
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,078
who you are as a human being

466
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,639
i think i i don't want to explore it i

467
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,078
think i get around it you know i tap

468
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:58,399
dance around it but i get it out a

469
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,239
little with my act maybe because i i

470
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,360
can't do it i'm not doing it in real

471
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,759
life so i'll

472
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,120
get out this uh no love

473
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,560
not loving myself i don't know who wants

474
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,679
to love himself everybody always said

475
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,958
you got to love yourself and then when

476
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,120
you meet somebody who does love yourself

477
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,879
you're like i [ __ ] hate this guy

478
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,519
don't you hate the guy who's upset i'm

479
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:16,958
great i'm awesome life is good like ah

480
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,278
this guy sucks

481
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:20,479
i'd rather an insecure guy so maybe i

482
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,639
want to stay insecure maybe i don't want

483
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,920
to find this love for myself

484
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,039
well okay so self love like just

485
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:28,879
appreciating

486
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,480
who you are like appreciating the moment

487
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,679
of being grateful doesn't have to

488
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,920
express itself by the guy saying

489
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,758
i'm awesome true it's more just like

490
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,278
humility he's just like walking calmly

491
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,680
to the world and just being grateful to

492
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,679
be alive that kind of thing and just

493
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:45,439
good and like being appreciative of all

494
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,958
the accomplishments he made so far i say

495
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,120
all this because

496
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:52,159
mostly i'm extremely self-critical in

497
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,720
everything i do and so

498
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,039
uh and i kind of enjoy it i think it's a

499
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,959
nice little engine that it makes it fun

500
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,919
it makes life fun because it's like

501
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,399
if you hate everything you do

502
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,119
like you've done in the past that gives

503
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,880
you like all right we can do better yes

504
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,558
but that's the key is making itself

505
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,839
critical always trying to get better i

506
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:13,119
could change this i could tweak this i

507
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:14,958
can improve this

508
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,719
when you just go i hate that i do this i

509
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,600
suck you just shut down so that's the

510
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,679
key is is always being productive with

511
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,438
the uh with the criticism yeah and the

512
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,519
basics of life i'm just like grateful

513
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,720
for it to be alive that's nice to be a

514
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:31,200
couple like couple that with uh two legs

515
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,679
again the hairline the hog the muscles

516
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,840
the the the world you got a good brain

517
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,960
on you i mean you're you're lucky you're

518
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:38,480

they have

531
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,439

look back and go uh can you believe

539
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,558

somebody like slavery

541
00:18:18,558 --> 00:18:22,879

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,640
hilarious what does he say about um

554
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,200
i'd rather have a bottle in front of me

555
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,558
than a frontal lobotomy that was the one

556
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,720
that was the one that sold me i was like

557
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:57,599
this guy's awesome yeah but his music

558
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,759
because he's just a genius musician yeah

559
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,359
anyway he was talking about new york i

560
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:03,279
was walking around this i'm in new york

561
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,038
right now we're in new york right now

562
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,038
it's still a magical city to me a lot of

563
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:10,000
people are quite cynical about it about

564
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,759
the state of things but

565
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,839
well not not like michael males like a

566
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,519
lot of friends of mine they're just a

567
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,480
lot of folks in san francisco and new

568
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,720
york there's something about the

569
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,319
pandemic where people have become

570
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,000
quite cynical about the place they are

571
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:23,439
and they tried to escape

572
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,960
it's interesting i mean they're asking

573
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,440
some difficult questions about what they

574
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,759
are in life they're having like a

575
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,600
self-imposed midlife crisis is it's good

576
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,919
i think for everybody to go through this

577
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,439
process but i think i hope new york

578
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,280
reemerges

579
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,000
it will as the flourishing place for the

580
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,759
weirdos anyway the tom wade said new

581
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,359
york of course

582
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:47,119
is to be in endless surreal situations

583
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:49,439
where a 50 000

584
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,879
gunmetal mercedes pulls up in a puddle

585
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,038
of blood and outsteps a 25 karat blonde

586
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,039
with a two dollar wristwatch

587
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,558
and he goes he keeps going on so like

588
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,720
it's like um

589
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:02,480
that's like bars he's like a rabbit yeah

590
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,759
he's good uh

591
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,038
but basically just the absurdity of it

592
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:12,240
all lots of money lots of weirdos

593
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:14,640
uh degenerates and dreamers and the

594
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,839
whole the whole mix of it do you think

595
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,840
um

596
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:20,079
i think that's an accurate description

597
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,959
of what new york is today like is there

598
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,798
still place for the weirdos and just the

599
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,240
interesting artists

600
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:29,599
the the edgy the comedians the the

601
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,440
creators

602
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,439
the the

603
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,200
the entrepreneurs like

604
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,120
as opposed to like wall street as

605
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,400
opposed to like

606
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,678
rich folk

607
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,440
and then like

608
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,880
hopeless folk yeah i think it's

609
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,200
definitely changed a lot there's a

610
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,960
there's a tiny corner for us weirdo

611
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,360
artists new york used to be where you

612
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,200
went to make it as a painter or whatever

613
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,199
a comedian or a singer and there were

614
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,558
all these dives and [ __ ] boxes and all

615
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,080
these places you could go

616
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,678
and now there's now it's more

617
00:20:56,079 --> 00:21:00,480
pinkberries and

618
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,038
subway sandwiches and chase banks so

619
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,640
it's definitely lost a lot of its uh

620
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,158
creative edge it's just money money

621
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,679
keeps coming in and now you see all

622
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,360
these comedians moved to nashville

623
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:13,280
austin denver whatever so uh

624
00:21:11,359 --> 00:21:15,038
it doesn't have the the power it used to

625
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,440
have of like you gotta be here if you

626
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:18,879
want to make it that's definitely gone

627
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,720
uh so

628
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,720
that hurt the city a lot the city is is

629
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,960
way more soulless

630
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,240
when i moved here in 07 i mean not only

631
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,440
did i get mugged three times in the

632
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,558
first year

633
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,679
but

634
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:31,839
it was

635
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,600
a hub of like it felt like things were

636
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,038
happening here you know it was it was an

637
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:36,639
energy it was electricity and we still

638
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,319
have the electricity but it's also maybe

639
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,520
just because it's time square there's

640
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:43,678
soho there's uh wall street so we got

641
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:45,440
the staples but there is a little bit of

642
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,120
that it's almost like a marriage like

643
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
yeah we're in love but it's not as

644
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,519
passionate as it once was

645
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:52,959
that's how i would equate new york

646
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:55,200
what gives you hope you're pretty

647
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,759
hopeful about it though i'm hopeful just

648
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,480
because i know it's magical and i and i

649
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,319
think

650
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,919
it has to be i mean it's the epicenter

651
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,000
of america like this is where the

652
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,159
immigrants came and this is where

653
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,759
the stock market is and the

654
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,600
entertainment industry a lot of it is

655
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:12,240
here so

656
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,599
i think it's it's gonna happen but it

657
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,519
all something like the bottom has to

658
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:17,678
fall out and then people have to move

659
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,440
back here and all that so something

660
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,798
the corporations are kind of [ __ ] us

661
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,080
they're just buying everything well

662
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:23,839
that's true for everything that's

663
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:25,359
awesome for everything it's true for

664
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,639
austin probably as well people just

665
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,158
buying out land and all that kind of

666
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,280
stuff you always hear a hemingway and

667
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,679
dali and all these guys went to paris

668
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,519
in the 20s or whatever that was

669
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,880
yeah i get it now i'd be like why do

670
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,679
these guys go to paris you know what are

671
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,280
these

672
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,080
artists and now i get it because it's

673
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,839
like it's freer there that's why austin

674
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,279
became like that paris where everybody's

675
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,480
like i gotta get out of la i'm going

676
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,240
there

677
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,159
and uh

678
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,279
maybe but we came back from that you

679
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,039
know the 70s were wild and 90s were cool

680
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,960
so maybe it'll come back might just take

681
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,558
a decade well there's always that's how

682
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,679
stories are told there's always pockets

683
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:00,639
of

684
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,679
like

685
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,000
paris within new york right

686
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,480
there's just an opportunity to

687
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,880
let your weird flourish is there in new

688
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,558
york i'm sure they're i mean

689
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,240
um

690
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,000
it's there you gotta find it before it

691
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,759
was front and center

692
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,400
what's your favorite thing about new

693
00:23:17,759 --> 00:23:22,720
york like what what kind of

694
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,960
things just like i mean how long's this

695
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,159
pod i could go on it's just it's too

696
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,840
much to

697
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,280
to put into one hour we've got other

698
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,240
questions but

699
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,599
i love that one neighborhood is wildly

700
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,440
different than the next i'm in little

701
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,119
italy and then you take four steps now

702
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,440
i'm in chinatown i mean and then the

703
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:41,199
history there and then the stories

704
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,320
and the food and the culture and all

705
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,000
that

706
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,519
and then you go ten feet over here and

707
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,119
now you're in brooklyn and this is

708
00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:48,960
insane there's a whole other world and

709
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:51,599
it's it's almost like a little america

710
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:54,880
in one

711
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:56,639
you know uh city and it's great and uh

712
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,760
just the fact that they pulled it off

713
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,520
like

714
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,038
fifth avenue goes way up and you're like

715
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,278
there's a billionaire's house next to a

716
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,038
hobo and then this is a black guy who's

717
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,038
fighting with a cuban guy and an asian

718
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:08,960
guy's uh trying to get in the middle of

719
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,319
them and the cabbies from uh the middle

720
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,919
east and

721
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:13,678
there's so many beautiful women here and

722
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,440
there's so many brilliant minds here and

723
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,600
and the pace is great it keeps people

724
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,360
moving i mean it just

725
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:20,798
you can't beat it i mean the city will

726
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,798
[ __ ] you in the ass too don't get me

727
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:25,759
wrong you landed jfk and you're like oh

728
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:28,960
god i got mugged my uh my uber driver

729
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:30,879
called me a homo i stepped in and human

730
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,679
[ __ ] where the [ __ ] am i

731
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,840
um so yeah it's it's bad news but that

732
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,759
bad news it's almost like the bullying

733
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,278
it kills you in a weird way but it makes

734
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,038
you stronger and you build more layers

735
00:24:39,278 --> 00:24:43,038
and layers and layers that's why some

736
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:45,200
new guys some hayseed from milwaukee

737
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:47,278

you're not gonna run new york the

745
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,559
treadmill is on so it just makes you run

746
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,919
and it makes you better look it wears on

747
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:07,839
you you probably lose 10 years of your

748
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,640
life living in new york versus

749
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,558
uh you know indianapolis but

750
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,840

mean uh at norton

754
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:25,119
there's a there's a whole like monologue

755
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,278
there about

756
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,759
they're talking about

757
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,519
just he he has like a mix

758
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,440
it's there's like melancholy music i

759
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,440
think or just a melancholy feel to the

760
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,600
whole thing but there's an anger and a

761
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,919
disgust with the city but through the

762
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:42,079
anger and the disgust comes out like a

763
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,080
love for the city same with was taxi

764
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:45,119
driver in new york oh yeah

765
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,278
crazy

766
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,239
yeah so like that there's something

767
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,278
about what is that what is that that uh

768
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,558
grit

769
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:53,679
of the city

770
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:54,558
that

771
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,720
like

772
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:59,200
pushes you down well that's the beauty

773
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,960
of the city is it's this tribal human

774
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,159
nature like the

775
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,640
sex shops and fist fights and racism and

776
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,840
all tension but yet it's the epicenter

777
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,720
of technology and finance and

778
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,000
sophistication on fifth avenue so you

779
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,519
get that

780
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,798
juxtaposition

781
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,720
it's kind of like in boston you go to

782
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:18,960
boston they got mit they got harvard

783
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,679
they got all this [ __ ] and then they got

784
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,759
the fishermen the blue-collar douchebags

785
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:26,159
the irish guys the immigrants you know

786
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:29,519
and you get that mix of like insanely

787
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,960
smart with wicked pissa and these these

788
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,558
two worlds and that's that's a good

789
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,278
thing it's like when a black guy [ __ ]

790
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:38,399
an asian lady that's a good looking kid

791
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:39,679
you get a mix you know we're mixing two

792
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,960
totally different things they're coming

793
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,960
together and it makes it it's like

794
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,798
peanut butter and chocolate

795
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,038
peanut butter and chocolate i've never

796
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:48,798
tried that what peanut butter maybe i

797
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,919
haven't talked about reese's like

798
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,839
reese's

799
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,799
yeah yeah it's the best candy yeah

800
00:26:53,839 --> 00:26:59,278
without the fakeness of la without the

801
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:02,879
without the kind of um

802
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:05,200
with the facade yeah at least tough

803
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:08,080
what's the difference between uh la

804
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,159
comedy new york comedy to you um

805
00:27:08,079 --> 00:27:11,918
i think one place you kind of go to make

806
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,799
it and be discovered

807
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,000
and be loved and one place you go you

808
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,240
can you can get all that in new york too

809
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,960
but i think in new york it's more of a

810
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,038
a school a boot camp of comedy

811
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,200
let's make great comedy let's make

812
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,278
original comedy let's watch the other

813
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,399
guys and gals who are at the show at the

814
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:30,240
clubs and

815
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,479
learn from them and

816
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,120
try to hang out with them and absorb

817
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,919
some of them and in la it's like

818
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:39,678
when am i on i'm next get out of my way

819
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,759
i'm the star here

820
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:43,360
i'm a bigger star than you oh this guy's

821
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:44,960
actually a big star i gotta outwork you

822
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:47,119
know it's just a lot of that instead of

823
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,120
like damn that was funny i gotta be that

824
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,879
funny damn i wish i had a joke and look

825
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,719
i don't want to speak for la comics

826
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,880
because there's you know bill burr

827
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,798
anthony jeselnik this brilliant l.a

828
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,960
comic but they all cut their teeth in

829
00:27:56,798 --> 00:27:59,918
new york just saying then they moved to

830
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,000
l.a

831
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,559
that's a good point ali wong all these

832
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,038
people killer comics but new york

833
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,480
started new york moved to new york

834
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:10,000
there is something about comics that

835
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,480
stay in new york for a long time though

836
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,319
like david towel ah you know about dave

837
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,558
yeah yeah he wants to do this podcast he

838
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,319
does yeah i'm a huge fan of david oh

839
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:19,599
yeah but it's like it almost like he

840
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,038
doesn't

841
00:28:19,599 --> 00:28:22,480
want to make it

842
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:23,679
i don't know i mean you probably know

843
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,240
him but like

844
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:28,240
it feels like you just

845
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,038
maybe it's romanticizing it but you're

846
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,120
like

847
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,919
you almost just love the art of comedy

848
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:35,519
like becoming funnier crafting the jokes

849
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,960
becoming funnier than the other comics

850
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:40,480
like competing with each other kind of

851
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,798
thing not over like money or fame or any

852
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,640
of that just just purely the comedy of

853
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,079
it totally that's dave that's him in a

854
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,520
nudge he's like that guy in the movies

855
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,480
in the 80s action movies where they're

856
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:51,759
like they go up to a a creek in montana

857
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,240
and some guy's living in a cabin and

858
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:56,079
he's sharpening a stick and they go

859
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,759
the russians are coming they're invading

860
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:59,759
we need you you're the best commando and

861
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,359
he's like i gave that up man i'm done

862
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,919
with that lifestyle like well you're the

863
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,038
best we need you and he has to suit up

864
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,399
eventually you know he looks at a

865
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:08,158
picture of his dead wife and he goes

866
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:11,119
[ __ ] it i'm going and then they you know

867
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,520
fight the ruskies but uh he's that guy

868
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:16,639
he just is gifted he's like got a gift

869
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:18,720
from a la and he's the best

870
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,799
yeah a lot of comics give him props it's

871
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,880
always surprising to me i didn't because

872
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,720
surprising to me because

873
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,200
he hasn't really made it

874
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,440
like big he did in the 90s he was huge

875
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,038
he had his own tv show he was yeah yeah

876
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,960
that show that show was awesome but i

877
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,119
mean like as big as i think he deserves

878
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,759
to be so i well that's art the

879
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,599
mainstream [ __ ] is always the worst

880
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,038
it's like mcdonald's versus some hole in

881
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,639
the wall i know i'm [ __ ] on

882
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,200
mcdonald's again but

883
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,120
it's good and you know certain comics we

884
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:51,278
could name are good but

885
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:54,079
the the delicacy is going to be less

886
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:54,880
talked about and less uh household namey

887
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:56,879
than

888
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:58,799
than the mainstream

889
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,039
hacky [ __ ] yeah it's funny because he

890
00:29:58,798 --> 00:30:04,480
hasn't uh i think he was on

891
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:07,519
uh joe rogan's show once maybe yeah once

892
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,240
again and he was with somebody else um

893
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,679
jeff raw yeah he met him with jeff ross

894
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,640

895
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,960
mikes thing with mike's yeah yeah

896
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,799

897
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,880
one funnier yeah

898
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:22,558

to bomb in stand-up comedy like to fail

911
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,759

926
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,960
it's the it's the validation too is the

927
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,278
worst part like because you know

928
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,038
whenever you do comedy and kill you can

929
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,319
be a great comic but even david tell

930
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,119
these brilliant guys they feel like

931
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:32,319
they're getting you feel like you're

932
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:34,158
getting away with something i don't have

933
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:35,519
a day job i'm telling jokes for a living

934
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:36,799
i'm talking about my dick up here and

935
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,640
they're [ __ ] loving me and they call

936
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,440
me a genius and all this i'm talking

937
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,720
about my sack yeah you know and uh and

938
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,320
it's great it makes people happy and

939
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,640
it's funny but

940
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:48,240
uh that bombing when you bomb you go

941
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,000
your first thought is like yeah you're

942
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,359
right at first you're like

943
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,880
[ __ ] you guy what you don't like this

944
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,398
[ __ ] and then you just start going in

945
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,720
you're like yeah maybe it isn't that

946
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:59,199
good maybe they're right i do suck i

947
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,240
knew i sucked i should become a mailman

948
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,880
you know and uh it stinks and it feel

949
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,399
you feel alone and you feel like you

950
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,760
wasted their time and then you're like

951
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:09,759
what was i thinking i could be a

952
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,240
comedian what the [ __ ] who am i you know

953
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,879
eddie murphy what am i doing here so

954
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:16,240
it's a lot of just spiraling out of

955
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,480
horrible thoughts

956
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,599
but i also love that it hurts so bad

957
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,519
bombing [ __ ] hurts because now now

958
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:25,199
everybody doesn't do it i think a lot

959
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,759
more people could do comedy probably and

960
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,080
figure it out but the bombing is so

961
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:31,519
brutal that it keeps uh

962
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,278
one time i went to minneapolis i was

963
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,960
like this is a great city i mean the sun

964
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,000
is shining why isn't the city like

965
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,278
packed and they're like because the

966
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,720
winners are so bad and we love it

967
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:40,319
because it keeps everybody out and i

968
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,600
feel the same about comedy the bombs are

969
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,200
so brutal

970
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,558
i've had bombs where i'm in i'm in bed

971
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,000
i'm just staring at the ceiling like

972
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:49,119
what the [ __ ] was that like you have

973
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,558
ptsd i bombed at an arena once 20 000

974
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:54,839
people i did 30 minutes to silence

975
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:57,599
so it's not just like one joke

976
00:32:54,839 --> 00:33:00,158
fails they start piling on like it's

977
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:01,519
irrecoverable yes and one joke failing

978
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,840
is very common like a lot of audience

979
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,120
don't even notice like that bomb because

980
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,398
you get you know you got so many jokes

981
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,319
in a row you can sandwich a good one

982
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,558
then a bad one then a good one but when

983
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,079
you bomb it's almost like they chose we

984
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:14,398
don't like you

985
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:16,960
nothing you say will redeem yourself

986
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,558
and uh it's hard to get out of it's like

987
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,319
being pulled down by your hair you can't

988
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:21,839
get back i can't win this fight no

989
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:23,439
matter what

990
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,480
can you like get him back by

991
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:26,880
acknowledging

992
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,319
like the alpha in the room that like

993
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,679
that helps but they're still gonna go

994
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:32,480
and that was funny when he made fun of

995
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,720
it but he sucks he's still so he still

996
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,880
sucks that's the worst part you're going

997
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,759
no this is good you guys just don't like

998
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,360
me just because you don't like me

999
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,679
doesn't mean i'm bad

1000
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:44,959
yeah i like going to open mics a lot

1001
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,399
just just listening because

1002
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,440
first of all i think the audience and

1003
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:51,359
open mic at least the ones i've been to

1004
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,038
is uh mostly i guess other comedians

1005
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,199
it's it or like at least people who

1006
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:56,240
don't seem to want to laugh at anything

1007
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,480
and so

1008
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,558
i just love it because it's human nature

1009
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,200
and perseverance that is best that

1010
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,200
here's comedians like clearly

1011
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,759
uh this is mostly in austin they have a

1012
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,358
dream like why would you get up there

1013
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,918
right

1014
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:14,239
like maybe some weird you know

1015
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,759
new year's resolution [ __ ] but for

1016
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:18,000
the most part it's people who want to be

1017
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,679
comedian like a lot of the open mikers

1018
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,119
are people who clearly have done this

1019
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,200
for quite a long time

1020
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,399
like at least a year two maybe five

1021
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,678
years

1022
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:29,118
and

1023
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,760
they're often not very funny

1024
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:33,119
and um

1025
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,639
the just

1026
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,039
bombing in front of

1027
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,119
an audience of like 20 where they're

1028
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:40,239
just sitting there

1029
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,320
like

1030
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,759
almost like mocking them with their eyes

1031
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,359
or maybe

1032
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,079
and i don't know and they still push

1033
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,000
through they still they still like as if

1034
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,560
they're doing an arena and everybody's

1035
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:54,960
laughing yeah they still they still got

1036
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:56,719
that energy trying almost like to an

1037
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,119
audience

1038
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:01,199
that doesn't exist like an audience of

1039
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,280
their dreams because i guess you have to

1040
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,039
do that to keep the energy of the act

1041
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,800
going and it's just so beautiful to

1042
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,559
watch wow then try it it's uh and also

1043
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,400
the what happens

1044
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:13,759
open mic i don't know five minutes

1045
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,960
whatever they do

1046
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,040
they you know walk off and that walk

1047
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,679
back you know off stage

1048
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:23,759
and like you can't who do they look at

1049
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:25,838
like what do you look at do you make eye

1050
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,680
contact with people do you you look at

1051
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:31,039
your phone you look at your feet you

1052
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:32,960
just zone out you kind of

1053
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,320
kind of go white you know you just hear

1054
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,400
white noise and go out it's it's tough

1055
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,400
but you got it you need a little

1056
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,760
a little delusion to be a comedian to

1057
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,000
get into it it takes a little bit of

1058
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,000
delusion like you think you can do this

1059
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,480
you know you got 10 years ahead of you

1060
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
of hell and you're up for this

1061
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,760
and you know most comics we see a

1062
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,920
horrible crowd and we see our friend

1063
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,440
bomb and we go yeah he's bombing but

1064
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,880
i'll get him i'll get him and then

1065
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,679
you don't get them

1066
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:01,119
but

1067
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,039
that's that's

1068
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,640
human nature too is like i they don't

1069
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,159
like him but they'll like me and you

1070
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:07,759
need a little of that to keep going as a

1071
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,519
comedian but you don't want too much

1072
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,320
delusion because then you're a psycho

1073
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:12,719
but

1074
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,800
you need a little well a psycho could be

1075
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:17,439
good for a comedy that's true too a lot

1076
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:19,119
of psychos i mentioned to you offline um

1077
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,119
that i talked to elon and we talked

1078
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,039
about doing stand-up that he's thinking

1079
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,480
maybe do a few minutes of stand up say

1080
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:28,480
if you need a coach elon i gotcha

1081
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,880
um well maybe you should move to austin

1082
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,079
to coach him full time ah i hope he can

1083
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,599
fly me in

1084
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,440
so

1085
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:38,160
what what advice would you give to

1086
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,240
somebody who um who wants to try to do

1087
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:45,039
five minutes like the early steps

1088
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,719
of uh trying to go to an open mic and

1089
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,719
say something funny well that's the

1090
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,799
irony of comedy is i don't know if it's

1091
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,399
irony but it's like the beginning is the

1092
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,400
hardest part usually the beginning is

1093
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,720
the easy part hey i'm playing this level

1094
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,559
of mario i'd start jump over one koopa

1095
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,039
troopa whatever and then the end is like

1096
00:36:58,559 --> 00:37:02,799
jesus christ i got 30 guys coming at me

1097
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:04,000
comedy is the opposite the beginning is

1098
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,160
like

1099
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,079
it's a gauntlet it's just obstacles and

1100
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:10,000
it's like you said open mics you i watch

1101
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,680
these famous comedians on netflix and

1102
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,440
you go this would all bomb on an open

1103
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,440
mic they're killing in you know radio

1104
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,720
city this would bomb it open mike that's

1105
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,119
the weird part so it's almost you have

1106
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,000
to go through hell just to get

1107
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:23,920
to the

1108
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,358
promised land and uh i would say

1109
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,639
rehearse the [ __ ] out of it because

1110
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:27,679
you're gonna get frazzled up there

1111
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,598
everybody thinks oh this is good

1112
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:31,440
material but you also forget about the

1113
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,559
other part of delivering it having

1114
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,119
confidence

1115
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:37,119
being likable having timing having a

1116
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,280
cadence figuring out who you are figure

1117
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,200
out what the audience thinks you are or

1118
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,800
how they perceive you because you can go

1119
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,719
up there and say all this but they go

1120
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,160
why's the guy he's clearly gay why is he

1121
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,358
acting like he's not gay you know that's

1122
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:49,519
all now they're not listening to the

1123
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,400
joke so like you got to know how you

1124
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:54,719
look and uh it's just repetition

1125
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:56,160
repetition and bombing is not failure

1126
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,399
that's what you got to remember i mean

1127
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:00,000
look if you if you do a a killer hour

1128
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,760
and then you take it to netflix and bomb

1129
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,639
you [ __ ] up but

1130
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,280
bombing is not failure it's just data

1131
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,039
it's going oh okay i gotta re retool

1132
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,359
that that didn't work something's wrong

1133
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,679
there they i missed a word there so you

1134
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:15,119
gotta treat the uh the act almost like

1135
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:18,960
uh

1136
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,720
like uh like ingredients in a

1137
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,720
cooking and a dish you know like oh that

1138
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:24,480
i put too many eggs in take an egg out

1139
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,399
you got to treat it like that and look

1140
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,400
when you pull a bad cake out of an oven

1141
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,800
you go i [ __ ] up but it doesn't hurt

1142
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,639
your feelings but when you bomb and [ __ ]

1143
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,079
up it hurts your feelings so you gotta

1144
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,799
factor that in too your feeling's gonna

1145
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,039
be hurt and just almost be a robot and

1146
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,800
just keep going towards that open mic

1147
00:38:39,039 --> 00:38:42,320
you know how scary an open mic is

1148
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,720
bombing sucks but bombing in front of

1149
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,440
other comedians is way worse because

1150
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:49,279
they know what just happened and they

1151
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,039
could have saved you and they didn't

1152
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,560
so it's way worse

1153
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:55,119
and that they're going to be your

1154
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,279
quote-unquote friends

1155
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,880
for this journey yeah no these are evil

1156
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,040
people

1157
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,720
twisted [ __ ] up

1158
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:05,119
work people

1159
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,879
can you tell like in those early days

1160
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:09,200
let's just talk about that like at the

1161
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,160
open mic level that a joke is going to

1162
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:14,639
be good on paper like i'll give you my

1163
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,719
experience because uh

1164
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:21,679
um maybe you can be my coach in this

1165
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,679
particular moment so uh larry nasser

1166
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,160
that's fun huh

1167
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,199
joking everybody i hope nobody thinks

1168
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,480
seriously

1169
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:31,919
uh there's i now have an amazing team of

1170
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,240
folks who help me with editing and

1171
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,440
they're now currently sweating

1172
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,959
you gotta leave that one yeah that was

1173
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,510
quick yeah that's pretty good i'll eat

1174
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,159
that one that was good

1175
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:42,560
[Laughter]

1176
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:44,639
all right so

1177
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,239
uh you know uh going in front of an

1178
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,078
audience just even to give a lecture

1179
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:49,838
terrifies me uh

1180
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,119
which which i've done

1181
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,559
but uh open mic i mean that to me

1182
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,519
perhaps that's why i like going to open

1183
00:39:54,559 --> 00:40:00,078
mics and listening is cause i just

1184
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,119
it terrifies me so much that idea yeah

1185
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,960
of

1186
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,079
going up there and bombing i mean it's

1187
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,400
scary and to do even like one minute to

1188
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:11,200
be honest is scary in five minutes

1189
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,960
i'm also watching enough open mics to

1190
00:40:11,199 --> 00:40:15,358
realize that five minutes is a long time

1191
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,000
i mean it depends on your comedy

1192
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:20,400
but if you're doing fast

1193
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,039
stuff five minutes is a really long time

1194
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,119
oh it's eternity um i guess it was a

1195
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,960
long story

1196
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:28,559
two is a long time because if the

1197
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,039
story's not work you're building up to

1198
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,960
something if the story is gonna fail you

1199
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:35,279
just spent all that time telling the

1200
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,960
story that completely went flat

1201
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,560
completely got nothing i guess if you

1202
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,639
have a series of jokes you can at least

1203
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:42,159
try to recover and like do the mitch

1204
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,480
hedberg thing where like all right i'll

1205
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:47,679
cross that off yeah yeah

1206
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,159
uh well i'm able to like i've tried to

1207
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:52,480
write a few things and i'm able to tell

1208
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,239
that it's really bad

1209
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,838
well that's better than most

1210
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:58,318
most people's egos kick and they go no

1211
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,559
this is good no see i'm able to

1212
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:02,079
introspect that like it seems funny i

1213
00:41:00,559 --> 00:41:03,358
mean i guess the thing i'm looking for

1214
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:04,240
is original

1215
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:06,559
like

1216
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,799
there's easy stuff

1217
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,199
that you think is funny but to me

1218
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,318
originality is the thing you should be

1219
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:15,919
looking for because then because then

1220
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,159
that's what's actually

1221
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:21,680
becomes funny like

1222
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:25,440
or rather if it's original

1223
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:27,919
even if it bombs that feels like more a

1224
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:30,159
beautiful art creation that you did like

1225
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,920
at least you swung for it like you did

1226
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:34,078
something unique because like even with

1227
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,240
open mic your first five minutes there's

1228
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,000
so many just go to enough open mics

1229
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:40,639
you'll hear like all the there's like a

1230
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,880
list of jokes that you just go to first

1231
00:41:40,639 --> 00:41:44,559
of all you can make fun of the fact that

1232
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,880
you're at open mic that you're like

1233
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,719
doing this the first time and so on you

1234
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,640
could do a lot of stuff where you make

1235
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,559
fun of your appearance in some way yeah

1236
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:53,358
and so on but like yeah you could do

1237
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:54,480
that

1238
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:56,480
you know

1239
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,318
that takes actually that's way harder

1240
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:01,440
than people realize to do it in an

1241
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:04,000
original way yes to present

1242
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,559
who you are as a person

1243
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,480
very quickly enough to then

1244
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,440
put that person down in front of

1245
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,719
everybody else so you have to reveal the

1246
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,519
audiences like that because they go he

1247
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:17,279
knows what we're thinking yeah exactly

1248
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:21,119
but do it again in an original way and

1249
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,119
so like when i'm trying to write stuff

1250
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,720
not that i've tried long it's like 30

1251
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:27,760
minutes but as

1252
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:29,919
enough to see like oh [ __ ] the to write

1253
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,240
something original is really difficult

1254
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,159
it is what do you you got a bit anything

1255
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:35,919
no you didn't write any one line or

1256
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,679
anything for this no well just in

1257
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,159
general ever in your life ever written a

1258
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,598
joke oh yeah yeah yeah yeah oh okay no

1259
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:43,679
but i don't have anything in my mind

1260
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:46,559
popped up so the

1261
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:48,960
the the jokes that i've written

1262
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:52,559
have more like for some reason my mind

1263
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,079
goes to like dark places so you know

1264
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,559
like

1265
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,560
and not actually dark in the mark norman

1266
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,838
dark because you go

1267
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:02,400
really dark

1268
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,759
to where it's like almost absurd yeah my

1269
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,039
natural inclination is to go to like

1270
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,160
a dark

1271
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:13,759
historical like place like hitler and

1272
00:43:10,159 --> 00:43:15,759
stalin yeah and almost

1273
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,000
so go to that place

1274
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,160
and then

1275
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,119
talk about something absurd

1276
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,799
there

1277
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:24,800
so like don't go like uh

1278
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:28,960
like all the way i don't know i don't

1279
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,439
want to give examples because it would

1280
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,358
be clipped but the

1281
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,200
but the mark norma style look it up he

1282
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,078
has a special on his youtube

1283
00:43:35,199 --> 00:43:38,480
uh

1284
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,318
that kind i i want to almost explore the

1285
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:41,440
dark aspects of human nature more kind

1286
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:43,519
of

1287
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:45,599
uh connected to actual historical

1288
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:47,838
figures that's the

1289
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,079
that's the inclination like i don't know

1290
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:52,318
nature's metal the the instagram channel

1291
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:53,359
that that explores like the darkness of

1292
00:43:52,318 --> 00:43:55,279
nature

1293
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,039
like something there

1294
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,920
see that's good that you already know

1295
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,119
that

1296
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,880
you've kind of gotten to the core of

1297
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,358
your comedy already and that that's

1298
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,039
interesting that's a step ahead

1299
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,199
yeah i can hear i mean with most things

1300
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:10,400
i do in life i can like hear the music

1301
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:12,399
from a distance like in myself like okay

1302
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,559
if you have anything this is the

1303
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,400
direction it'll be yeah without actually

1304
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,000
knowing exactly all the steps and that's

1305
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,838
the nice motivation to be like all right

1306
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,599
well if you do this for a long time

1307
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:23,920
maybe you'll have a chance to get there

1308
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,079
right but you have to i that that's

1309
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,680
where the it's a feature to be super

1310
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,240
self-critical i think yes but then

1311
00:44:27,679 --> 00:44:33,039
that's why it's [ __ ] terrifying to

1312
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:34,719
walk up to the stage stand there

1313
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:36,000
and probably forget everything yeah

1314
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:37,759
that's the other part nobody thinks

1315
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,920
about just goes right out of your head

1316
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:42,319
you go fight or flight it's ugly my

1317
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:44,318
first years were horrific bombing

1318
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:46,559
horrific stammering horrific not

1319
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,079
remembering the punch line like you got

1320
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,599
maybe you got a setup going and they're

1321
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,000
kind of on board and you're like ah

1322
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,880
how's that camera camera how it goes and

1323
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,519
you just

1324
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,880
hate yourself it's it's a nightmare but

1325
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:58,239
you've already kind of

1326
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,838
maybe if you haven't done stand-up or

1327
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,039
whatever but you kind of know your voice

1328
00:44:59,838 --> 00:45:02,880
and that's

1329
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:04,960
yeah that's pretty advanced so you're

1330
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,519
not trying to be somebody else i guess

1331
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,920
yeah just for having done like podcasts

1332
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,079
and lecturing and so on that helps you

1333
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,920
i've embarrassed i already done some of

1334
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,680
the work of the stand-ups do which is

1335
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,599
embarrass yourself in front of others

1336
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:21,039
for long periods of time yes yeah so

1337
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,359
i've done that without actually

1338
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:25,679
developing the funny right right right

1339
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:28,000
but maybe the funny just is not that

1340
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:30,159
difficult to develop

1341
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,079
um no it's super difficult of course but

1342
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:33,519
i mean maybe the essential work of a

1343
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:35,599
stand-up comedian is just the

1344
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,519
embarrassment of like finding who you

1345
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,119
are yeah that's a part of it for sure

1346
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,639
you know in the beginning you're like

1347
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:42,240
water bottle what's funny about water

1348
00:45:40,639 --> 00:45:43,920
bottle i'm a funny guy i can make this

1349
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:46,239
money but that ain't that's not it you

1350
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,240
know it's it's your [ __ ] your [ __ ] like

1351
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,479
your dark stuff for me

1352
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:51,919
i tend to gravitate towards dark but in

1353
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,199
a weird way where

1354
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,599
you know people say like hey don't

1355
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,838
objectify women but then they go caitlyn

1356
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,039
jenner's beautiful and you're like well

1357
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,279
wait

1358
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,199
i know something's off here why can you

1359
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,079
objectify her

1360
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:08,318
but not the supermodel so what's going

1361
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:10,720
on there and i like to play with that

1362
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:12,960
so i have this joke where i say uh

1363
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:14,559
caitlyn jenner

1364
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,838
oh women go caitlyn jenner's beautiful

1365
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,679
beautiful woman i go well you look like

1366
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,358
her and they go [ __ ] you

1367
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,679
and you're like there's a lot of truth

1368
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:22,880
there yeah but i like exploring that

1369
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:24,399
kind of

1370
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,318
oh you're trying to get one over on me

1371
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,000
or you're lying to yourself or what are

1372
00:46:26,318 --> 00:46:30,079
we doing here and i like i like that

1373
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,599
kind of comedy

1374
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,119
i don't see color well i'm black no

1375
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:34,960
you're not ah

1376
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:37,280
you know that's fun because you're

1377
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,519
you're lying

1378
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,160
uh yeah okay so

1379
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,759
like big time comedians such as yourself

1380
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:47,199
don't like to think of yourself in this

1381
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:49,680
way but here we go yeah this is like

1382
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:50,559
where you overfill philosophize comedy

1383
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,199
but

1384
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,119
yeah definitely it seems like

1385
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:56,639
comedians

1386
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,000
don't say important nothing worse than a

1387
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:59,679
comedian who thinks they're important

1388
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,519
yeah so i was going there i was trying

1389
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:02,799
to find as i was trying to say these

1390
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,719
words i read

1391
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,839
realize how cliche it is and how

1392
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:09,759
uninteresting it is so i'm going to just

1393
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:10,880
but there is something uh i'm worried

1394
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,319
this whole thing is uninteresting i'm

1395
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,400
like who cares about comedy and there's

1396
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:16,800
like six comics on the planet but nobody

1397
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,079
cares okay this is just i trust you in

1398
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,720
the in the pilot seat you know what

1399
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:22,960
you're doing you got you got listeners

1400
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:26,399
they've tuned out long ago

1401
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:27,599
dan carlin on here huh is he around yeah

1402
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,358
we're just going back and forth on

1403
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,599
twitter just now because i'm a huge fan

1404
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:34,078
he was on here before he'll be back

1405
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,760
i've been actually really

1406
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:38,720
uh trying to volunteer myself

1407
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:40,720
aggressively with dan carlin for

1408
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:43,039
for like a russian episode where i could

1409
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:44,959
speak russian i there's there's certain

1410
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:45,920
documents same i talked with jocko about

1411
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,318
this too

1412
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,760
certain things

1413
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:51,838
i mean i just love the challenge of

1414
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:53,680
bringing russian documents that i can

1415
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:54,719
read in russian and they can translate

1416
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:57,598
and can

1417
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,279
try to capture the uh the depth

1418
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,000
of the writing

1419
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:03,680
in um in the russian language and

1420
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:05,838
communicate to the american audience so

1421
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:08,399
much is lost in translation like there's

1422
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:10,159
so much pain and poetry in the russian

1423
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,559
language it's just connected to the

1424
00:48:10,159 --> 00:48:14,318
culture every language not every

1425
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,000
language but

1426
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:18,880
many languages are

1427
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,639
uniquely able to capture the culture of

1428
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,000
the people i mean in some way there's a

1429
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,039
representation of the culture of the

1430
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,639
people

1431
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,480
and so russian is definitely that it

1432
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:28,078
like represents the full history and

1433
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,679
culture of the 20th century with all the

1434
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,599
atrocities all the

1435
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:33,440
all the broken promises all those kinds

1436
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,119
of things norm says uh russian

1437
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:36,639
literature is

1438
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,880
it's the most tapped into human

1439
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:42,078
existence than anything else

1440
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:46,000
uh norm mcdonald yeah big big russian

1441
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:47,280
literature guy dostoyevsky all that [ __ ]

1442
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,800
it's funny that there is a gap with

1443
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,960
comedians too there's a culture of

1444
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,039
russian comedy uh like stand-up

1445
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,358
comedians that are told

1446
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,838
yeah yeah i don't know these russians

1447
00:48:55,358 --> 00:49:00,239
i mean uh i don't know today and oh i

1448
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:02,480
mean more from the 80s and 90s and

1449
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:03,838
there's a yakov

1450
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,519
that's all i know

1451
00:49:03,838 --> 00:49:06,799
that's not so there's like of course

1452
00:49:05,519 --> 00:49:09,039
that's that's

1453
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:13,200
i've never seen that offended no no it's

1454
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:13,199
not if and there's a different uh

1455
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:16,799
there's there's a there's like the

1456
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,480
kinnisons and the

1457
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,519
there's the edgy is that russian

1458
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,838
what do you mean wait i thought you said

1459
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:26,000
there was russian comics yeah russian i

1460
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:27,599
mean i'm comparing that i'm giving you

1461
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,239
that i'm giving you like a style of

1462
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,880
darkness uh like that's the kind the

1463
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,159
people that kind of challenge

1464
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,559
uh

1465
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:40,078
they give again this is to how important

1466
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:42,480
comedians are is they give a voice to

1467
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:45,760
people where in the soviet union you

1468
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,838
really can't like express your

1469
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:50,240
opposition to the government and so

1470
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:52,078
comedians are exceptionally

1471
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:52,799
important there

1472
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,720
for

1473
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,400
just just i don't know channeling the

1474
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:57,759
anger even when sometimes it's not the

1475
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,880
actual opposition to the government

1476
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:02,880
they're just channeling the anger the

1477
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,079
frustration with the absurdity of life

1478
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,760
like

1479
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:08,160
you know when there's a shortage of food

1480
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,559
shortage of jobs the the

1481
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:13,440
the absurdity of the bureaucracy like

1482
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,400
the a top-heavy government

1483
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:17,119
just

1484
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,480
all of that can only sometimes be

1485
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,720
expressed with like dark absurd humor

1486
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,318
and that actually why there's a culture

1487
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:26,318
of that kind of humor

1488
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:29,519
you know you gather on the table with

1489
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:31,759
vodka yeah and all you can do is just

1490
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,880
talk [ __ ] yep and just

1491
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:36,800
be offensive say horrible [ __ ] ball bust

1492
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:38,240

empathize the way you do maybe we're

1498
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,839
different

1499
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,519

1503
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,359
kerouac said

00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,000
right you know

1523
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,719
obviously norm but uh chris rock was

1524
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:40,239
huge for me chris old like 90s chris

1525
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,519
rock was like

1526
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:43,039
i didn't know you could do jokes like

1527
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:45,280
that i always loved george carlin and

1528
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,759
groucho marx and bill murray there's so

1529
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:49,760
many different types of comedy but uh

1530
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,440
when i saw the bigger and blacker bring

1531
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:53,839
the pain i was like

1532
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:55,280
oh my god this like it hit me

1533
00:51:53,838 --> 00:51:57,279
so that was big and then norm's just

1534
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:59,119
like the funniest guy on the planet so

1535
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,359
him him being the smartest guy in the

1536
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:02,640
room but acting dumb was great

1537
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:04,799
so uh

1538
00:52:02,639 --> 00:52:06,000
yeah chris rock has that way of cutting

1539
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,318
to the

1540
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,920
the [ __ ] which i i mentioned earlier

1541
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,159
i like that cutting through the [ __ ]

1542
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,079
kind of style of comedy because you kind

1543
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,920
of go oh i'm not crazy that's what i

1544
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,839
thought too i was too scared to say but

1545
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,358
i thought that and he's saying in a room

1546
00:52:17,838 --> 00:52:21,119
of people are laughing

1547
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:22,799
maybe i'm not an idiot

1548
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,760
so that helped me

1549
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,760
so it's

1550
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:27,119
observational but not

1551
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,359
jerry science

1552
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,920
observational it's like look going to

1553
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:33,199
the darker thing yeah like like wasn't

1554
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,519
great but

1555
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:37,199
i like him too but seeing it doing it

1556
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:40,719
about stuff like

1557
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:43,118
in your life society yeah race gender

1558
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:46,159
government yes politics all that kind of

1559
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,920
stuff exactly exactly sex human emotions

1560
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:50,159
jealousy whatever it is that that's the

1561
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:53,358
good stuff

1562
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:55,440
how'd you feel when norm passed away ah

1563
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:57,039
that was a bummer because uh he was you

1564
00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:00,559
know what 61

1565
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:03,358
and i just didn't see it coming and i

1566
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:06,160
just i've watched so many hours of his

1567
00:53:03,358 --> 00:53:06,880
stuff and i i've met him and he he's

1568
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:08,639
like

1569
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,318
he was like this comedic bar like hey we

1570
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:12,239
got norm you know there's so much [ __ ]

1571
00:53:10,318 --> 00:53:14,800
comedy then you see norm and you're like

1572
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:17,919
this is next level this is savant type

1573
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:19,039
[ __ ] and then to lose him is like ah

1574
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,599
norm had

1575
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:23,920
20 more years at least of just content

1576
00:53:21,599 --> 00:53:25,760
and content and thoughts and his point

1577
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:27,440
of view and that's we'll never get that

1578
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,200
that sucks

1579
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:32,000
yeah there is something about artists

1580
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,919
like jimi hendrix dying yeah too early

1581
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,239
it's like you wonder

1582
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,960
what was next yeah what was next but

1583
00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:41,118
then part of it is like

1584
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,240
um you know it all ends for all of us

1585
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,400
and it's like walking away early

1586
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:49,199
is um

1587
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,400
it's kind of admirable it's almost like

1588
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:54,239
i did a pretty good job yeah i'm uh i'm

1589
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,480
i'm good with that and especially the

1590
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,519
way he did which is not telling anybody

1591
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,199
i know

1592
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:00,719
nine years his best friends didn't even

1594
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:04,558

you know cancelled and yelled at in

1597
00:54:06,318 --> 00:54:09,599
trouble and he could have pulled that

1598
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:11,838
cancer card and he never did i mean the

1599
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,280
integrity on this [ __ ] did you

1600
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:15,039
get a chance to interact with him like

1601
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,599

00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,480
not elf

1639
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:36,399

1642
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:44,639
it's like a little uh said uh uh tolkien

1643
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,119
character imp yeah my name is european

1644
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,039
mythological being similar to a fairy or

1645
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:52,160
are you calling me a fairy

1646
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:53,599
frequently no okay similar to a fairy or

1647
00:55:52,159 --> 00:55:55,679
a demon

1648
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:58,160
i feel like that's a big leap big leap

1649
00:55:55,679 --> 00:56:00,318
yeah that's not a great uh info bio

1650
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:02,239
there frequently described in folklore

1651
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:04,079
and superstition the word may perhaps

1652
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:05,759
derive from the term

1653
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:08,880
imp spell with the y

1654
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,839
used to denote a young grafted tree

1655
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,280
oh

1656
00:56:09,838 --> 00:56:13,358
it's a little mischievous you got a

1657
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,000
twinkle you're the serious buttoned up

1658
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,759
guy but this is a twinkle as a twinkle

1659
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,280
wow and the audience can see the twinkle

1660
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,160
and that's why you resonate i think

1661
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:27,359
i'm sorry deep analysis by mark norman

1662
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:28,798
psychological analysis okay but then

1663
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:30,558
back to the crafting of the joke you

1664
00:56:28,798 --> 00:56:32,079
said chris rock and norma mcdonald like

1665
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,319
what for you

1666
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:36,400
um how do you know when the joke is like

1667
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:39,039
done is are there some jokes or you're

1668
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,240
like are proud of like wow that

1669
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:44,079
that's uh that's well done yeah yeah the

1670
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,039
joke is done it's a tough question

1671
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,798
because there's so many different kinds

1672
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:48,719
of jokes that's what we call a chunk

1673
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,679
which is a big idea with a bunch of

1674
00:56:48,719 --> 00:56:53,439
jokes in the middle of it and then a big

1675
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:56,239
crescendo at the end or there's a

1676
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,119
one-liner or there's a tag of a joke

1677
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:01,679
that's also a joke so

1678
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,200
the jokes come in different uh like i

1679
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,358
have a joke where i say i met my girl in

1680
00:57:03,199 --> 00:57:06,558
that jewish app what's that jewish app

1681
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:07,838
called uh

1682
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:09,920
paypal

1683
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:11,199
nice

1684
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,159
that's the hell that's the reaction you

1685
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:16,639
want from the crowd but

1686
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:17,679
it's a fun turn because you say your

1687
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:19,358
thing and then i hit you with a

1688
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:21,759
misdirect and that's what a joke is a

1689
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:23,358
joke is basically me saying something

1690
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,680
that makes sense but you didn't see it

1691
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:27,679
coming yeah and that's a perfect example

1692
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:30,000
of that so uh that joke took forever to

1693
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,199
figure out by the way you know and you

1694
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,559
have to go through different services

1695
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,798
like paypal okay

1696
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:36,319
what's funniest exactly and i figured

1697
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:38,880
paypal is funny because it has the word

1698
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:42,079
pay in it yeah you know venmo it's also

1699
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,160
not really a good work venmo paypal it

1700
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,760
just hits better yeah paypal is funnier

1701
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:46,960
somehow it's funnier and that's the

1702
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,799
beauty of com there's a weird little

1703
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,280
magic into it you can get technical all

1704
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:53,679
day and formulaic but there's still that

1705
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:55,680
little bit of uh fairy dust that you

1706
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:58,078
don't know why this is funnier

1707
00:57:55,679 --> 00:58:00,239
or imp dust imp dust

1708
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,920
yes the why

1709
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,239
okay so you know what joke is done when

1710
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,680
it kills and if this is a roundness to a

1711
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:08,479
joke when you feel like this is buttoned

1712
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:09,919
up this is done here yeah is simplicity

1713
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,318
the right word there

1714
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:13,920
yeah is it like you're chopping stuff

1715
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:15,838
away are you adding stuff like what does

1716
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:16,720
it feel like simplicity is always the

1717
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:18,318
best

1718
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:19,838
angle i mean you can get real high

1719
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:23,199
concept with a joke and still make it

1720
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:25,358
work but the simpler the better i saw uh

1721
00:58:23,199 --> 00:58:28,078
dave chappelle on stage once and chris

1722
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:30,480
rock and dimitri martin were in the back

1723
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,680
watching in awe and dave schweller i

1724
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,838
can't remember the joke but he said

1725
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:36,078
something about sex or women

1726
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:38,400
and demetri martin goes that's a little

1727
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,480
easy and chris rock goes that's why it's

1728
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,240
good and i remember hearing that as some

1729
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,760
young comic like ah

1730
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:46,078
i'm getting this like you know comedy

1731
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,599
lesson right here from these two titans

1732
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,160
and so that was fun

1733
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,920
simple is key so the easy's okay that's

1734
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:54,480
such a weird uh i

1735
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:56,720
i think i remember um

1736
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:59,039
reading or hearing eminem say something

1737
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:00,239
about maybe the song some [ __ ] one of

1738
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:01,920
the songs

1739
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:02,959
he's like i knew it was going to be good

1740
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,838
because

1741
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,920
it got like really repetitive and

1742
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:09,679
annoying very quickly

1743
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,680
i mean that's the the sort of the music

1744
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:13,919
equivalent of um

1745
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:14,960
it's too easy like if it's like super

1746
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,280
catchy

1747
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:20,000
as a musician you might get

1748
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,079
very quickly bored of it right or like

1749
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,280
as you're creating it now it's too it's

1750
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,200
too easy

1751
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:27,680
it's like there needs to be some more

1752
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:29,519
complexity to it but i like complexity

1753
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,078
but the best guys who

1754
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:33,440
are the ones who make complex [ __ ] look

1755
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:35,200
simple

1756
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:37,358
like you ever heard that uh

1757
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:38,239
ben franklin story where he's talking to

1758
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:40,558
his friend his friends like i'm gonna

1759
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:41,358
start a hat store so he puts a sign out

1760
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,960
says

1761
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:46,798

1762
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,639
at it goes uh well you don't need the

1763
00:59:46,798 --> 00:59:49,679
twelve dollars because you know all they

1764
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:51,039
need to know is that you got hats for

1765
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:52,798

1766
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:54,318
twelve dollars makes a new sign hats for

00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,400
sale and he goes you know you don't

1768
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:58,639
really need for sale because it's a

1769
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,838
business people can put that together so

1770
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:01,598
he just goes all right he makes a new

1771
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:03,039
sign it says hats and then ben

1772
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,640
franklin's like

1773
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,960
you know you don't really need the word

1774
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:08,159
hat you can just put a picture of a hat

1775
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,358
and he made a new sound which is a

1776
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:11,039
picture of a hat and like help the

1777
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:13,199
business or something that's like some

1778
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:14,960
old wives tale or whatever but i think

1779
01:00:13,199 --> 01:00:16,318
about that all the time when i'm writing

1780
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:20,000
i thought this was going to like there

1781
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:21,838
was no sign it went like super like

1782
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:23,039
that could work too

1783
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:23,838
uh

1784
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:26,480
what

1785
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:28,159

1789
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,119
is

1790
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:38,719
all right i can't tell like emotion

1791
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:41,200
you're tough not to read cold inside

1792
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,798
i mean just the quickness you have

1793
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:45,279
obviously you're also a great stand-up

1794
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:48,000
comedian what's your favorite medium

1795
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:50,640
to shine in so you have a podcast

1796
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,519
yourself an excellent podcast

1797
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:54,879
um

1798
01:00:51,519 --> 01:00:56,798
you're often a podcast guest yeah

1799
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:57,920
which is always fun to listen to how

1800
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:00,559
you're going to deal with the different

1801
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,240
people you're great on rogan oh thank

1802
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:04,720
you um

1803
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:06,639
what what do you enjoy most podcasts are

1804
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:07,759
great because you can you can stretch

1805
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:09,519
out a little more you can breathe a

1806
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:11,760
little you know with a stand-up set i

1807
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:13,838
like to be like boom boom boom boom boom

1808
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:15,760
but podcasts are great because

1809
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:17,039
it's conversational so you can be it's

1810
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,440
almost like you're being funny with your

1811
01:01:17,039 --> 01:01:22,318
friends yeah whereas the stage is like a

1812
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:25,119
this is a piece this is a presentation

1813
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:27,199
uh but i think the the podcast is great

1814
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,880
but you don't get the reaction unless

1815
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:30,719
the host is laughing you can't hear the

1816
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,240
guy in his car in new jersey driving to

1817
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:33,279
work going ah

1818
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:34,719
every now and then i'll read a comment

1819
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,400
like i spit out my coffee when you said

1820
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:37,838
this and i'm like

1821
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,760
but it's not immediate you want the

1822
01:01:37,838 --> 01:01:42,480
immediate so stand up will always be

1823
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:44,799
number one but there's no better feeling

1824
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,798
than killing in a room of people who

1825
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,639
don't know who you are strangers you're

1826
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:50,798
in the middle of nowhere you left your

1827
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:52,879
wife at home you left your kids you left

1828
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:55,920
your house you're in the middle of bum

1829
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:58,640
[ __ ] dickville and murdering for these

1830
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:01,119
hillbilly nobody whatever it is

1831
01:01:58,639 --> 01:02:03,358
and they're slinging their beers and

1832
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:05,920
cheering you on and they carry out and

1833
01:02:03,358 --> 01:02:07,440
you [ __ ] some fat lady and you leave and

1834
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:09,838
you get back to your hotel and you go

1835
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:12,480
holy [ __ ] what was that no one will ever

1836
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:14,400
know about it just lost in the ether

1837
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,280
that's the best feeling

1838
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,039
yeah

1839
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,200
killing an obscurity as bill burr would

1840
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,240
say

1841
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:23,439
yeah this is one of the things that

1842
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:24,959
sucks about giving lectures

1843
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:27,280
like

1844
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,400
at universities or giving lectures in

1845
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:32,480
general is when you look at

1846
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:33,760
the audience you know several hundred

1847
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:35,599
students

1848
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:36,799
they're all have a bored look on their

1849
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:38,880
face

1850
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:41,119
like even like my my face now probably

1851
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,880
looks bored but i'm actually excited to

1852
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:45,280
be talking to you but there's something

1853
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,720
about just uh

1854
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,960
there's something about a comedy called

1855
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:51,038
maybe this the contingent of laughter

1856
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,639
but like it gives people the freedom to

1857
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:54,319
just laugh to like

1858
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:56,879
to remove that facade of like you don't

1859
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,880
have to you don't have to pretend

1860
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:01,519
like you don't care like if you care you

1861
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:04,079
can show it and yeah have fun with it

1862
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,798
probably liquor is helpful too yeah it

1863
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:08,000
helps for sure but there is a especially

1864
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,559
and that's why comedy i think is so

1865
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:13,440
popular right now because

1866
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:15,200
hr is up our ass we're scared of old

1867
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:17,358
tweets that might come back to haunt us

1868
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,879
what did i say on that interview uh even

1869
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,838
people at offices are like i put

1870
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:23,680
something on facebook in

1871
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:25,759
1999 that was about fat tits that i

1872
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:27,440
liked should i get rid of that

1873
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:28,720
even people say like there's no cancel

1874
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,798
whatever

1875
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:32,558
there is something in the air right now

1876
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:35,038
and that wasn't there before yeah it's

1877
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:36,798
the video i i'm a karen i got caught at

1878
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,079
trader joe whatever it is this people

1879
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:39,599
rat on each other now everybody's

1880
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,119
tattletailing because they want the

1881
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:44,480
clicks it's a horrible

1882
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:46,880
society we've crafted but

1883
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,639
stand-up comedy gets you to come out and

1884
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,318
now people do it at stand-up shows too

1885
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:52,400
sadly but it gets you to come out and

1886
01:03:50,318 --> 01:03:54,079
let that inhibition down like because

1887
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,160
we're all human we've all had the [ __ ]

1888
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,760
up thoughts like man that guy's fat as

1889
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:58,960
[ __ ] you don't mean you hate the guy

1890
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,720
that mean you hate fat people then

1891
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,079
you're fat shaming but you can't say

1892
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:03,759
that at the office you can't go pop

1893
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:07,200
you're fat as [ __ ] you'll get fired for

1894
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:09,200
body shaming but at the club you go that

1895
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:10,719
guy's fat as [ __ ] the crowd goes he is

1896
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,000
bad as [ __ ]

1897
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:14,159
and it's this weird cathartic thing

1898
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:15,358
because all we do is tamp [ __ ] down it's

1899
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:17,199
kind of like you ever meet a girl who's

1900
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,358
like all prim and proper in the bedroom

1901
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:21,838
she's like put a lamp up my ass ah you

1902
01:04:19,358 --> 01:04:23,598
know whatever it is it's cause

1903
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:24,798
we gotta get it out we're all repressed

1904
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:26,400
in some way

1905
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:27,420
so i guess what you're saying is uh

1906
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,440
comedy's important

1907
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,798
[Laughter]

1908
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,159
yes

1909
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:36,000
call back all right well played sir yeah

1910
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:37,440
what do you think about austin what do

1911
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,599
you think about the comedy scene austin

1912
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,798
talk about l.a in new york

1913
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,760
what do you think about what joe's

1914
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:46,559
trying to create there so i i i should

1915
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:48,880
say that the reason i moved to austin i

1916
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:50,079
have this dream of uh wouldn't be funny

1917
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:52,480
if i said this dream of becoming a

1918
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:55,039
comedian oh yeah

1919
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,400
an audience at least yeah that's true

1920
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,160
you know i always said you can hear the

1921
01:04:56,400 --> 01:04:59,920
music in the distance i you know i have

1922
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:01,440
this dream around robotics and

1923
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,119
artificial intelligence whether it's a

1924
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:05,200
company whether it's something else that

1925
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:06,559
uh it was just pulling me to do i

1926
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:08,639
actually wanted to move to san francisco

1927
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,720
and then all my friends in san francisco

1928
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:14,239
said no it's the wrong place yeah to to

1929
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:16,078
uh it's no it's at this time the the the

1930
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,879
cynicism there

1931
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:21,359
is just not conducive to like

1932
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,960
taking big leaps into the unknown

1933
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:26,558
excited about the future kind of thing

1934
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:28,480
and and austin was that uh with um for

1935
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:30,400
me in particular with elon musk but also

1936
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:33,199
just the energy that everybody had

1937
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:34,400
including joe the excitement about the

1938
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:36,399
future

1939
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,079
i don't i don't care if austin burns to

1940
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,880
the ground and it actually is a complete

1941
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,000
failure yeah uh being excited about the

1942
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:43,920
future

1943
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,079
seems to be like optimism about the

1944
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,159
future it seems to be the thing

1945
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:50,000
that actually makes that future happen

1946
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:52,159
it makes a great future happen so it's

1947
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:53,599
always cool for me to see

1948
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:56,399
uh like joe

1949
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:59,280
super excited about creating like a

1950
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:01,519
a culture in austin like a

1951
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,599
making it a comedy hub like yeah i don't

1952
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:06,318
want to overstate it but he i mean i

1953
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:08,798
think he really believes it'll be a very

1954
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:10,880
big place for comedy yeah in the united

1955
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,960
states in general in the world and so

1956
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,838
just even believing that that's powerful

1957
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:15,679
like

1958
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:19,119
you start to make it you start to make

1959
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:20,558
it happen that energy uh is there anyway

1960
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:23,200
so but that's for me from just an

1961
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:24,559
outsider watching uh the fun of i should

1962
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:27,279
also mention

1963
01:06:24,559 --> 01:06:29,039
for less of an outsider more insider in

1964
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:30,960
the martial arts world

1965
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,920
partially probably because of joe i'm

1966
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:36,880
not sure like john donahue

1967
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:39,280
gordon ryan the b team all those folks

1968
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,760
those are that might be gibberish to you

1969
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:43,440
but those are like some of the greatest

1970
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,839
grapplers and martial artists of all

1971
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:48,079
time so it's also becoming this hub

1972
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:50,960
of martial arts so the whole the whole

1973
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,720
thing is just beautiful anyway what uh

1974
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:55,039
what are your thoughts about that scene

1975
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:57,598
well there's a lot a lot here a lot of

1976
01:06:55,039 --> 01:07:01,359
things to mention one i think joe

1977
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:03,039
did do that to at a degree you know like

1978
01:07:01,358 --> 01:07:04,960
all these people segora lives there now

1979
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,440
a lot of comics live there he's opening

1980
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,119
clubs other clubs are opening

1981
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,880
i think it's happening that's the other

1982
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,480
thing is people go everybody's moving to

1983
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:13,680
austin austin's the new hub and then

1984
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,199
they look at their watch and they go

1985
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:16,960
five minutes went by nothing changed

1986
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:18,719
it's gonna take

1987
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:20,000
years you know but everybody wants it

1988
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:22,558
now now now

1989
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:24,159
um what awesome there's no

1990
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:25,760
industry there you know there's no

1991
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:27,440
netflix whatever and you're like yeah i

1992
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:29,280
know but it needs a minute you can't

1993
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:32,639
just do this overnight so people forget

1994
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:34,160
that so it could happen huge just give

1995
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:36,400
it some time i mean he's opening a club

1996
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:38,719
i went and saw it it's incredible like

1997
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,200
it's so perfect for comedy it's every

1998
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:42,639
detail it's incredible but uh

1999
01:07:41,199 --> 01:07:45,598
so

2000
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:47,038
it could happen still i do think

2001
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,960
where there's a little biting off more

2002
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:51,760
than they can chew with austin because

2003
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,838
it's not that big so it's gonna spread

2004
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:56,319
out i mean yeah it's not big and the

2005
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:57,358
infrastructure is not quite exactly to

2006
01:07:56,318 --> 01:07:59,599
support it

2007
01:07:57,358 --> 01:08:02,078
but it has a lot of uh you know i'm

2008
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:04,559
comparing for my from the tech side

2009
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:07,200
for uh it has a lot of land to expand

2010
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,798
into so it might become this that helps

2011
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:10,239
like you're basically establishing it's

2012
01:08:08,798 --> 01:08:12,239
kind of like when new york you're

2013
01:08:10,239 --> 01:08:14,078
establishing these whole neighborhoods

2014
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:15,118
yeah and you have the freedom to do that

2015
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:17,679
because

2016
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:19,838
there's a lot of space on all sides yes

2017
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:20,960
okay so that helps so again maybe some

2018
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:22,238
time

2019
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,480
uh

2020
01:08:22,238 --> 01:08:26,399
i do agree with this that new hope

2021
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:28,879
that's kind of built into human beings

2022
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:30,798
of like let's go to america let's go to

2023
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:32,880
utopia we even have it with space let's

2024
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:35,600
go to mars we gotta see what's over

2025
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,119
there and it's just red dusty [ __ ]

2026
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:38,880
but you still gotta go

2027
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:40,559
so i'm with you on that about this new

2028
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:42,798
hope this new land

2029
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,000
uh and i think that is beautiful and i

2030
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:46,479
think there's a lot of haters and

2031
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:48,479
there's a lot of naysayers who hate

2032
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:50,479
change who hate anything new and then i

2033
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:53,439
think you got to go hey that hurts that

2034
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:55,198
sucks but blow me [ __ ] i'm trying

2035
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:56,798
something you're a loser

2036
01:08:55,198 --> 01:08:58,399
stop hating on me

2037
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:00,798
i mean how many people hate elon musk

2038
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:02,639
you know yeah it's hilarious i mean

2039
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:05,198
there's uh some of the criticism on

2040
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,640
austin it would be it's like a fad like

2041
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:08,719
a lot of people are really yeah yeah i

2042
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,880
really people are excited about austin

2043
01:09:08,719 --> 01:09:12,719
and somehow that's like uh it's like

2044
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,920
when green day became famous you no

2045
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,838
longer want to

2046
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,279
be a fan of green day but to me like

2047
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:19,039
this uh

2048
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,839
austin was already a cool town like

2049
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:23,439
every comic five years ago was like oh i

2050
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:26,238
got austin this weekend i can't wait

2051
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:28,639
yeah so it already had a buzz but

2052
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:30,798
some people think maybe the buzz was the

2053
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:32,960
cool part the fact that it was like this

2054
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:35,439
off the beaten path city

2055
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,838
and now i get to visit it and then leave

2056
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:40,639
but i think it could still be this

2057
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:42,158
comedy tech booming place it just will

2058
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:43,039
take some time and people want it right

2059
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:45,119
now

2060
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,000
well on the tech side

2061
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:48,960
it's

2062
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:51,279
uh it's already there it's it's it's

2063
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,600
getting there very fast so i mean elon's

2064
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:56,800
really pushing that with the factory

2065
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:58,960
it's just a huge number of people are

2066
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:01,119
moving there with jobs like you're

2067
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,960
already starting and then the

2068
01:10:01,119 --> 01:10:05,279
opportunities to launch new companies is

2069
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,679
just incredible i guess it's not right

2070
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:09,920
now it's like within months within a

2071
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,520
year that kind of thing but like it's an

2072
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:12,640
opportunity to just

2073
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,040
start to

2074
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,880
build [ __ ] in a new place and it's cool

2075
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:19,279
it's kind of like you know going to mars

2076
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,119
it's like you get to start over yeah and

2077
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:22,639
i like the hope aspect i think that's

2078
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:24,319
huge for people

2079
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:26,239
and uh

2080
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:27,840
i'm all for it i hope it works out i

2081
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:30,718
don't know if it will but i don't know

2082
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:33,119
anything about economies and city scans

2083
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:34,640
planning and all that [ __ ] so

2084
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:35,679
it might be too early to say but i hope

2085
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,119
it works

2086
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,319
are you still talking about austin or

2087
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:42,479
mars austin mars is uh

2088
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:44,319
there's nothing there there's no vagina

2089
01:10:42,479 --> 01:10:46,799
there there's no food there there's no

2090
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:49,119
water there i don't know it seems i get

2091
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,000
space travel i think it's important but

2092
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:52,399
i

2093
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,198
i don't know mars is really gonna

2094
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:55,198
move the needle

2095
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,560
so what are your thoughts about uh elon

2096
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:03,359
musk and spacex and launching rockets

2097
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,960
into space i think it's all good because

2098
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:06,238
you could say hey we could just feed

2099
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:08,239
everybody and i was like yeah that's

2100
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:10,000
true by the way these guys give a ton of

2101
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:11,599
money to like philanthropy [ __ ] that

2102
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,119
nobody cares about

2103
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,719
by the way you know it's weird like he

2104
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:17,599
can feed the

2105
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:19,359
nigeria and with pocket change of his

2106
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,960
and you're like well maybe he has

2107
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:22,479
you know like i heard bill gates gave

2108
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,560
back so much money he saved six million

2109
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:27,119
lives yeah but that's a reverse

2110
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:29,280
holocaust by the way that's pretty good

2111
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:30,800
what have you done you're a barista

2112
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:33,119
so uh

2113
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:35,039
you know i just think uh

2114
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:36,079
i think space travel is good because you

2115
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,238
learn

2116
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:39,600
about the place you're living in from

2117
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,599
going to space

2118
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:42,480
it kind of helps you learn about this

2119
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,679
more

2120
01:11:42,479 --> 01:11:45,678
you could say what's the point of going

2121
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:48,480
to this other there but it it does help

2122
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:50,640
i think yeah doing difficult things in

2123
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,959
the engineering space seems to be a way

2124
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:55,119
to develop like as a

2125
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:56,960
as almost like an accident as a side

2126
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:58,880
effect of doing a really difficult thing

2127
01:11:56,960 --> 01:12:01,279
in a team of brilliant people you

2128
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,880
develop things like the internet and you

2129
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,479
could argue that the internet maybe is

2130
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:06,960
not so good for society no i'm just

2131
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:08,238
kidding that's good and bad yeah but

2132
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,399
it's like a pull-up you're trying to get

2133
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:12,479
your bicep going but hey before you know

2134
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:13,679
you got decent forearms but you weren't

2135
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:16,000
working on the forearms you wanted to

2136
01:12:13,679 --> 01:12:18,399
buy but you got the four and i think

2137
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,719
that's kind of what space travel is

2138
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:23,119
i like how this like pivoted into uh to

2139
01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:25,279
a out routine advice wow we're trying to

2140
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:27,198
get uh an analogy going here all right

2141
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:28,079
it worked pretty well i'll take it all

2142
01:12:27,198 --> 01:12:30,238
right

2143
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:32,399
what are your thoughts about

2144
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:35,839
since i'm a robotics person i'd be

2145
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:38,158
curious to see like what um

2146
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:40,239
you think about the space at all about

2147
01:12:38,158 --> 01:12:42,158
first of all autonomous vehicles with uh

2148
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:44,238
tesla autopilot and

2149
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:45,759
uh waymo

2150
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:47,359
self-driving car i'm not sure if you're

2151
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,840
familiar with all the autonomous

2152
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:52,319
vehicles and so on so those are robots

2153
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,800
on wheels and then there's also legged

2154
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:56,319
robots so next time you're in austin you

2155
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:58,480
get to meet some of the legged robots

2156
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,479
i've

2157
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:03,440
been working on

2158
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:06,479
and i find those kind of um

2159
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:08,879
a fascinating way to explore

2160
01:13:06,479 --> 01:13:12,799
the nature of intelligence in our

2161
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:16,560
computers but also explore our own

2162
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:19,840
intelligence and also explore our own um

2163
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:23,120
like what makes us connect to other

2164
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:25,360
living beings whether it's dogs cats or

2165
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:26,158
other humans like there's some magic

2166
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,319
there

2167
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:30,559
that's beyond just intelligence and i

2168
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:32,639
like when i have the robot dog there's

2169
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:34,000
some aspect to it

2170
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:36,000
that

2171
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,000
i don't know brings me joy in a way that

2172
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,319
a dog does in a way that a good friend

2173
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:42,279
does yeah that's interesting and i'm not

2174
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:44,399
sure if that's some kind of

2175
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:47,519
anthropomorphism like where i'm

2176
01:13:44,399 --> 01:13:49,599
projecting right my hopes for this what

2177
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:51,360
this thing is but maybe a little of that

2178
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,440
but it's kind of built in i mean it's

2179
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:54,880
just a source of joy maybe it it's

2180
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:57,759
connected to the fact that there's just

2181
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:59,679
like a loneliness within all of us

2182
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,199
within me and it's just nice to have

2183
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:03,199
other

2184
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:05,119
things in your life

2185
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:07,279
that move that recognize you that kind

2186
01:14:05,119 --> 01:14:09,119
of thing i mean i suppose it's nice to

2187
01:14:07,279 --> 01:14:11,119
even just have a plant

2188
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:12,479
yeah it is plant goes a long way you see

2189
01:14:11,119 --> 01:14:13,760
a guy with plants in the department it

2190
01:14:12,479 --> 01:14:15,119
changes the apartment because they're

2191
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,960
alive you got to water them you got to

2192
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:18,800
put sun on them so yeah i think there's

2193
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,880
something there and i think you can see

2194
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,119
people's reactions when you show them

2195
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,199
advanced technology like these dog

2196
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:27,760
robots or these robots that dance and

2197
01:14:25,198 --> 01:14:29,599
[ __ ] people are like what the [ __ ] like

2198
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:32,640
it hits home in some way whether it's

2199
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:35,120
fear or or you want to [ __ ] them clearly

2200
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,480
whatever it is but it does connect with

2201
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:39,519
you in some way

2202
01:14:36,479 --> 01:14:40,799
so uh i'm with you and i think this is

2203
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,080
why i don't think robots will take over

2204
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,279
you always say that robot they're making

2205
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:45,760
them too advanced they're going to wipe

2206
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:48,960
us out blah blah blah

2207
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:50,719
if robots get human emotions

2208
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,079
that is scary because they could they

2209
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:53,359
could get mad at us and kill us and

2210
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:54,479
they're stronger they don't need sleep

2211
01:14:53,359 --> 01:14:55,439
they don't need food they don't need

2212
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:56,718
water

2213
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:58,479
they don't get jealous they don't you

2214
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,800
know but if they have

2215
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:02,479
emotions then i think we can dominate

2216
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,719
them because who's that emotion who

2217
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:06,639
knows emotions better than us we've got

2218
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:09,198
thousands of years of evolutionary

2219
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,880
emotional [ __ ] we can go hey robot i

2220
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:13,678
heard you uh your wife [ __ ] that black

2221
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,119
and decker huh they're gonna crumble

2222
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:17,679
we can bully them

2223
01:15:15,119 --> 01:15:19,840
emotionally manipulate robots yes that's

2224
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,279
when we'll win

2225
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:22,239
right now they could kill us they could

2226
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:23,759
just

2227
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:25,759
we'd all die then we shoot them back

2228
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:27,920
bing bing bing bing that's no good but

2229
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,760
if they do get emotions then we can

2230
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:31,520
go hey you look like hell what is that a

2231
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,039
rusty bolt hey you're dropping some oil

2232
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,120
there you know you lose her i think we

2233
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:37,198
can win if we if they do get emotions

2234
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:39,359
this goes back to your father being able

2235
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:41,439
to undercut you with a single word

2236
01:15:39,359 --> 01:15:43,119
you're right yeah so we're the creators

2237
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,599
of the robots and then the robots will

2238
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:47,920
just you you would say the the exact

2239
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,000
thing yeah where the robot would be like

2240
01:15:47,920 --> 01:15:52,079
that son of a [ __ ] and then he goes

2241
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:54,479
back to his hole and just sits there

2242
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:57,279
miserable right yeah hardware looks more

2243
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:58,559
like software to me you can't get it up

2244
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:00,158
yadda yadda

2245
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,920
yeah but i'm not worried about robots

2246
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:04,960
and i think self what do you think about

2247
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,719
the self-driving cars is that just

2248
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:09,359
wiping out the horse and buggy isn't

2249
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,880
that just progression of technology

2250
01:16:09,359 --> 01:16:13,519
yeah so i don't know if you've driven in

2251
01:16:10,880 --> 01:16:16,079
a tesla for example i have i've i wrote

2252
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:18,080
in the uh the passage

2253
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:19,519
yeah there's several stages in that i

2254
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:20,800
think it's the problems way harder than

2255
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,960
people realize

2256
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,520
and for quite a while it'll just make

2257
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,520
driving more pleasant it'll make it less

2258
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:29,440
stressful it'll take over some of the

2259
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:30,719
boring bits for you

2260
01:16:29,439 --> 01:16:32,158
and make it easier like there's

2261
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:33,198
something that happens actually when the

2262
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:36,399
car

2263
01:16:33,198 --> 01:16:38,799
is driving for you in the following way

2264
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:40,079
like it's it's staying in the lane it's

2265
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:42,320
keeping distance to the car in front of

2266
01:16:40,079 --> 01:16:44,479
you maybe it's changing lanes

2267
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:46,559
it allows you to relax a little bit like

2268
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:48,319
yes you become

2269
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,920
you still have to be alert but you

2270
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:51,920
become like a passenger and you get to

2271
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,480
like take in the world i mean somehow

2272
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,158
that's more relaxing without making you

2273
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:57,198
necessarily

2274
01:16:56,158 --> 01:16:59,920
like

2275
01:16:57,198 --> 01:17:01,039
bored more it's energized anymore so i

2276
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,480
just think it makes the driving

2277
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:04,719
experience more pleasant

2278
01:17:02,479 --> 01:17:06,319
but when you actually fully automate

2279
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:08,960
cars when you can just completely tune

2280
01:17:06,319 --> 01:17:11,679
out start reading a book or go to sleep

2281
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,960
that might change

2282
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:15,440
society

2283
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,840
like in ways we don't even understand

2284
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:20,000
because you'll have

2285
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,520
i mean the the

2286
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,198
they'll probably change the nature of

2287
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,600
roads because the cars because now you

2288
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:28,399
can be super productive

2289
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:30,400
and so it no longer quite matters to you

2290
01:17:28,399 --> 01:17:31,920
as much how long it takes to get from

2291
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:34,238
point a to point b

2292
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:37,119
because you're not wasting that time

2293
01:17:34,238 --> 01:17:38,879
you're just continue working yeah it's

2294
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,000
like public transit that comes to you

2295
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:40,880
exactly

2296
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,039
and

2297
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,560
so they there will be maybe less roads

2298
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,800
and bigger roads and it'll just change

2299
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,560
the nature of how we get from point a to

2300
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:50,880
point b i think you're right but that

2301
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:53,360
then couple that also with the fact that

2302
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:55,920
we seem to be more and more comfortable

2303
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:57,599
existing in the digital world yeah

2304
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,440
so like maybe we won't want to go

2305
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:01,280
outside more and more we'll just

2306
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:03,599
interact with each other virtually and i

2307
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:05,279
don't mean zoom meetings i mean just

2308
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,920
in other ways

2309
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,519
that's uh that's

2310
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:11,600
that's more fulfilling than a zoom

2311
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,360
meeting there's but then maybe not

2312
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:15,440
because like there's something deeply

2313
01:18:13,359 --> 01:18:17,439
uncompelling about

2314
01:18:15,439 --> 01:18:19,759
about zoom meetings like podcasts that

2315
01:18:17,439 --> 01:18:21,439
are remote

2316
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,360
unless they're super information dense

2317
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,279
at least to me as a podcast fan kind of

2318
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:27,439
suck they suck there's no connect it

2319
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,800
goes back to the dog thing with the zoom

2320
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:30,559
there's no connection

2321
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,840
yeah and we're not you know i i don't

2322
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:34,000
understand why they're we're not even

2323
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,440
making eye contact no it's but it's just

2324
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,119
something there it's in the room there's

2325
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:39,039
pheromones and that's like

2326
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:41,359
out of our understanding probably it's

2327
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:42,719
just some kind of weird biological

2328
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:45,679
you know you ever have cheerios in a

2329
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:47,439
bowl the cheerios tend to

2330
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:49,039
they tend to go together you see a

2331
01:18:47,439 --> 01:18:50,399
cluster of cheerios they're never really

2332
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:51,359
hanging out on the other side and that's

2333
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:53,519
kind of how

2334
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:55,119
people are in the industry real life i

2335
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,280
wonder what the physics of that is so

2336
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:59,279
they they come together and they stick

2337
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:00,639
especially with molecules yeah i don't

2338
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:01,599
know i camera what it was but it was

2339
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,840
fascinating and i think that's how

2340
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:07,440
people are and i think you try to write

2341
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:08,560
a tv show or or craft a movie with your

2342
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:09,599
team

2343
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:12,320
zoom

2344
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:14,880
not nothing there it's like phone sex

2345
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:16,880
versus penetration

2346
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:18,640
one day you'll learn that i i know

2347
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:20,239
nothing of either the i look forward

2348
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,239
because i think there's the phone sex

2349
01:19:20,238 --> 01:19:23,759
netflix documentary

2350
01:19:22,238 --> 01:19:26,479
there's a show or something like that

2351
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,800
that uh is really populated i want to go

2352
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:30,959
watch at least i can learn about that

2353
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:33,840
okay i could send you some links

2354
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,719
like really on the internet yeah yeah

2355
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:36,319
yeah

2356
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:38,640
but yeah self-driving car i think it's

2357
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:40,238
just inevitable it's coming and these

2358
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,000
truckers are gonna have to figure

2359
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:44,399
something out

2360
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:47,279
yeah i mean that's that's an understood

2361
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:49,359
industry actually because there's not uh

2362
01:19:47,279 --> 01:19:50,960
there's a lot of trucking jobs oh yeah

2363
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:52,559
and people don't want to well people

2364
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:54,719
don't actually take them anymore because

2365
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:57,120
it's such a difficult job so

2366
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:59,198
it won't have or a lot of people believe

2367
01:19:57,119 --> 01:20:01,439
it won't have as big of a negative

2368
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:02,960
impact as folks anticipate oh good

2369
01:20:01,439 --> 01:20:05,839
there'll be other automation i think

2370
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,119
they'll have a huge impact yeah for sure

2371
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:08,800
i mean you already see it in mcdonald's

2372
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:10,639
you go to the people why do you want to

2373
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,279
get yelled at by the uh heavyset woman

2374
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,719
of color you know for making a bad order

2375
01:20:13,279 --> 01:20:16,238
when you can just you know hit the

2376
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:18,399
screen

2377
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:20,559
but those interactions i think

2378
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:22,238
are human i mean that's part of life so

2379
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,840
it is scary taking away everything how

2380
01:20:22,238 --> 01:20:26,079
long till we're not [ __ ]

2381
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,760
that's coming too yeah then there's

2382
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:30,079
gonna have two two types of people are

2383
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:32,480
you uh uh [ __ ] in real life are you a

2384
01:20:30,079 --> 01:20:34,559
digital [ __ ] person i'm a digital i like

2385
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:37,039
real [ __ ] sorry we can't date that's

2386
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:40,320
coming well there's also the the

2387
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:42,238
reproduction side of sex which is like

2388
01:20:40,319 --> 01:20:44,079
with genetic engineering

2389
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:44,839
you'll be able to specify a little bit

2390
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,279
of

2391
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:49,279
details i talked to uh jamie martial

2392
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:51,198
about that like where you can

2393
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:52,719
um

2394
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:54,960
specify like

2395
01:20:52,719 --> 01:20:57,119
what you know uh

2396
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,560
it'll start with like i want my child

2397
01:20:57,119 --> 01:21:01,039
not to have

2398
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:02,080
like a high likelihood of diabetes or

2399
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:03,920
something like that

2400
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:05,600
and then you get to specify like

2401
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:07,840
intelligence you just get to specify

2402
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,960
those kinds of parameters until

2403
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,400
you're like

2404
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:11,920
basically trying to create a perfect

2405
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:14,479
human and you lose some of the magic of

2406
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:16,639
the flaws that make us who we are yes

2407
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:18,238
and you know i

2408
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,679
i'm pretty sure in the full lineup of

2409
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:21,678
humans

2410
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:24,319
like the so

2411
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:27,119
let me uh give you some information

2412
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:30,479
i'm sure break it down i'm sure i'm sure

2413
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:31,760
you researched uh this thoroughly but

2414
01:21:30,479 --> 01:21:34,238
uh a

2415
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,520
a male of the human species of the homo

2416
01:21:34,238 --> 01:21:38,799
sapien

2417
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:41,520
uh produces 500 billion

2418
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:43,679
sperm cells in a lifetime

2419
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,400
so that's all

2420
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:48,399
uh some more than others

2421
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:50,879
that's all

2422
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:52,638
uniquely genetically unique humans that

2423
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:55,440
you could produce so even across those

2424
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:57,679
500 billion you can select

2425
01:21:55,439 --> 01:22:00,000
and so i mean like abort some

2426
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:02,239
or no you can choose which of them you

2427
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,158
want i mean just imagine all the genetic

2428
01:22:02,238 --> 01:22:06,799
possibilities that are there like all

2429
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:07,920
the possible like you won

2430
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,840
the race

2431
01:22:07,920 --> 01:22:11,679
yes

2432
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:13,760
uh shocking this is yeah this is the

2433
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:17,440
ball the 500 billion you have to imagine

2434
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:19,840
what the competition was oh just tards

2435
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:22,000
all day long handicap

2436
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:24,719
well so it's not actually the the

2437
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:26,639
fastest sperm or like it it's i think a

2438
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:28,319
lot of his timing and luck

2439
01:22:26,639 --> 01:22:30,159
uh what it seems like there's actual

2440
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:32,319
papers on this and i've actually been

2441
01:22:30,158 --> 01:22:34,479
reading them i hope so so it's not just

2442
01:22:32,319 --> 01:22:36,238
like the fastest sperm to the egg okay

2443
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:39,279
there's a timing thing

2444
01:22:36,238 --> 01:22:41,119
so you were just lucky all right i i

2445
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:42,880
believe that so it's interesting to

2446
01:22:41,119 --> 01:22:45,599
think about like once you're able to

2447
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:45,600
specify

2448
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:49,199
some parameters of what your child is

2449
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:53,520
like

2450
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:54,799
how that changes the nature of um

2451
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:57,040
even just like

2452
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,719
the intimacy of two humans getting

2453
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:00,319
together

2454
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:03,359
and making

2455
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:04,559
creating together a child yeah i mean it

2456
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:06,079
changes it

2457
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:09,120
it's almost like uh i don't know it

2458
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:10,719
becomes like a factory

2459
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:13,119
line of some kind

2460
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,399
if you don't meet naturally yeah if you

2461
01:23:13,119 --> 01:23:16,319
don't mean natural

2462
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:18,559
and then you don't and you get you get

2463
01:23:16,319 --> 01:23:20,799
to optimize your child

2464
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,960
then it's yeah then it's something like

2465
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,000
you have to consider utilitarian type of

2466
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,760
things like

2467
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,679
what's good for society and it'll

2468
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,679
probably be regulation about what kind

2469
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:32,000
of children you can have or not like

2470
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:34,239
your child cannot have an iq below this

2471
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,399
or above us or something

2472
01:23:34,238 --> 01:23:38,000
your child cannot we already kind of do

2473
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:40,799
that we know

2474
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:43,279
vip clubs like hey you're kind of ugly

2475
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:45,279
or women go hey he's not tall enough we

2476
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:46,399
kind of do it a little yeah especially

2477
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:48,000
sexually

2478
01:23:46,399 --> 01:23:49,759
yeah we do can't get on the roller

2479
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,560
coaster if you're this short whatever it

2480
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:55,119
is you know we do it in some capacity

2481
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,960
but here this would be like

2482
01:23:55,119 --> 01:23:59,198
fully transparent

2483
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:01,840
and to a degree that uh it's hard to

2484
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:04,399
imagine like the way we currently do it

2485
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:06,239
you can at least get around it yes you

2486
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:08,158
can at least like trick your way onto

2487
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:10,559
the roller coaster even if you're short

2488
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:14,079
right or the fat guy can get rich so he

2489
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,080
can get laid you know there's other ways

2490
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:18,880
at the risk of asking the totally wrong

2491
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:21,679
person this question uh what advice

2492
01:24:18,880 --> 01:24:23,760
would you give to young people today

2493
01:24:21,679 --> 01:24:26,639
in high school and college about how to

2494
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:28,880
um have a successful career

2495
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:32,239
or career that they're proud of or maybe

2496
01:24:28,880 --> 01:24:34,159
have a life that they're proud of ooh

2497
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:35,678
well first of all you got to be

2498
01:24:34,158 --> 01:24:37,759
you got to want a life you're proud of

2499
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:39,199
not everybody has any integrity

2500
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,400
people just a lot of people just want

2501
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:42,319
short money

2502
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:44,479
i want to feel good

2503
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:46,479
look good right now

2504
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:49,119
i want to do molly boom i'll feel good

2505
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:51,039
you know but you should

2506
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:52,960
space it out you should it's almost like

2507
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:54,479
saving money so you can use it later

2508
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,639
nobody wants to save money what do they

2509
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:58,959
say like 11 of america actually has

2510
01:24:56,639 --> 01:25:01,440
money saved a thousand dollars or some

2511
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,679
[ __ ] it's wildly low

2512
01:25:01,439 --> 01:25:04,719
everybody wants it now now

2513
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:06,079
what do you call it immediate

2514
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,279
gratification

2515
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:08,559
i think

2516
01:25:07,279 --> 01:25:11,039
the key to

2517
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,400
happiness and satisfaction is working

2518
01:25:11,039 --> 01:25:15,039
for something

2519
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,719
even if it's uh it's like a baby if you

2520
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:18,719
could have a baby in five minutes if a

2521
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:21,920
woman you gotta you [ __ ] in her and

2522
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:22,960
she had a baby five minutes boom newborn

2523
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:24,639
healthy

2524
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,600
i think he'd be more likely to throw it

2525
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:27,520
away

2526
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,760
if you can make it that quick it's the

2527
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:32,400
fact that you spent nine months back

2528
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:34,560
breaking the labor the lactating the

2529
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:35,920
ripped placenta and the hymen or

2530
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,600
whatever the [ __ ]

2531
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:39,600
that's what makes you love it and i

2532
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,840
think it's the same with comedy or or

2533
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,920
making money or whatever look at these

2534
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:46,159
kids who like child stars they all

2535
01:25:43,920 --> 01:25:48,079
become heroin addicts at like 22 because

2536
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:49,839
they've just their sensors are burned

2537
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:51,198
out they're pleasure sensors you didn't

2538
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:53,679
have to earn it

2539
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:56,158
i think earning it is a big part of life

2540
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:58,480
and uh always try to do better try to do

2541
01:25:56,158 --> 01:26:01,279
more try to learn new things hey i'm

2542
01:25:58,479 --> 01:26:03,678
bored i life sucks like play the piano

2543
01:26:01,279 --> 01:26:06,000
then you chooch but you you won't do it

2544
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:08,399
because it takes effort and failure and

2545
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:10,158
all that but that's the good part yeah

2546
01:26:08,399 --> 01:26:12,719
and i know it's hard to see

2547
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:14,960
so i think that's uh that's a good

2548
01:26:12,719 --> 01:26:16,880
good key to life is work hard it's

2549
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:18,480
something you care about and then

2550
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:21,199
love the result

2551
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:23,439
the hard work the journey is actually

2552
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:24,638
way more important than just getting

2553
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:26,638
something everybody wants to go on

2554
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:28,400
amazon i got a package then you feel

2555
01:26:26,639 --> 01:26:29,760
good for 10 seconds and

2556
01:26:28,399 --> 01:26:31,599
all right let's go on amazon again and

2557
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,199
then you're just it's just a dumb cycle

2558
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,360
of you being

2559
01:26:33,198 --> 01:26:36,799
disgusting and gluttonous

2560
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:38,319
so work for it

2561
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:40,719
everybody wants to take steroids and

2562
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:43,039
just poop i'm buff why'd you point at me

2563
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:46,319
well i'm just rushing or what

2564
01:26:43,039 --> 01:26:47,840
i saw the the icarus yeah but no i'm not

2565
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:50,719
saying you're on roids i'm just you'd be

2566
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:51,600
way bigger but uh i'm just saying you

2567
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:53,840
know

2568
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:56,560
work for something and then i would also

2569
01:26:53,840 --> 01:26:58,880
young people eat [ __ ] early

2570
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:01,360
eat [ __ ] early i know a guy who kind of

2571
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:03,359
got cancelled or whatever and he had an

2572
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:04,799
out early but he tried to get by and he

2573
01:27:03,359 --> 01:27:07,359
tried to ride it

2574
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,279
and it all came crumbling down but if he

2575
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:10,479
had eaten it early like yeah i [ __ ] up

2576
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:12,238
i did that

2577
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:14,158
whatever it was

2578
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:16,479
he would have he would have just kind of

2579
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:18,000
been been [ __ ] on for a month and then

2580
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:20,238
it would have gone away but now it's his

2581
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,000
whole identity and that sucks so eat

2582
01:27:20,238 --> 01:27:25,198
[ __ ] early and i know it's hard to see

2583
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:28,000
what i mean early i'm in the present but

2584
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:29,839
look ahead look back this time will pass

2585
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,359
i mean look at high school high school

2586
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,920
was the biggest thing in our lives oh my

2587
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:35,920
god this exam susie q hates me the

2588
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,199
football player beat me up i'll never

2589
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,480
recover now you don't even think about

2590
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:40,879
high school it's just a blip in your

2591
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:42,638
dumb life you know and that's what this

2592
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:43,840
is now this will just be a blip so

2593
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:47,520
remember that

2594
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:49,440
and work towards something and uh

2595
01:27:47,520 --> 01:27:50,800
work hard and

2596
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:52,799
care about the result if the result

2597
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,320
isn't good try it again and failure is

2598
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:55,520
not always bad failure we look at

2599
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:58,639
failure is this

2600
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:00,880
end-all be-all my life's over i failed

2601
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:03,199
but failure is really just learning

2602
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:05,279
so that's something so in summary

2603
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:07,599
eat [ __ ] early and

2604
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:08,880
eat [ __ ] often yes

2605
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,039

01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:20,560
and it's classic and it's stick shift

2640
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,319
and it's

2641
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:26,400
grizzly and gritty and rusty and it's a

2642
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:28,880
bucket of bolts but i love driving it

2643
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:31,198
bucket of bulls yeah tom waits they're

2644
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:33,520
poets have you uh have you taken like a

2645
01:29:31,198 --> 01:29:36,479
long trip anywhere like road trip in

2646
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:38,719
your life or with this bmw not with it

2647
01:29:36,479 --> 01:29:41,919
it's pretty new but i will it's it's a

2648
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:44,480
new 90s yeah yeah it's new to me

2649
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,760
and it just it it it goes in the face of

2650
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:47,039
everything we're doing now everything is

2651
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:49,119
digital everything is automated

2652
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:51,439
everything is hands off everything is

2653
01:29:49,119 --> 01:29:53,760
delivered and this is the most hands-on

2654
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:55,599
thing in the world and i am dialed in

2655
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,679
man i got the tachometer i keep an eye

2656
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,520
on that oh i made i put the wrong gear

2657
01:29:57,679 --> 01:30:03,199
in [ __ ] oh it's about to stall put some

2658
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:06,239
gas put some clutch and it's all just

2659
01:30:03,198 --> 01:30:08,000
brain power and and staying in focus and

2660
01:30:06,238 --> 01:30:10,559
all that and it's the opposite of

2661
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:12,560
tweeting and texting and uh watching

2662
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,159
porn or whatever so

2663
01:30:12,560 --> 01:30:16,400
i almost needed that in my life so i

2664
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:19,039
bought this card just to have this

2665
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:20,319
little exercise

2666
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:22,238
i hope you don't mind that i'm just

2667
01:30:20,319 --> 01:30:24,000
trying out random questions i wrote on

2668
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:25,919
you that are completely

2669
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,238
they're like completely insane i'm a

2670
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,920
guinea pig jizz in my face bring it on

2671
01:30:28,238 --> 01:30:31,279
baby

2672
01:30:29,920 --> 01:30:33,359
this would be edited down to five

2673
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:34,399
minutes oh if everyone on earth

2674
01:30:33,359 --> 01:30:37,119
disappeared

2675
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:38,559
and it was just you left

2676
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:40,880
what would your

2677
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:43,440
days look like what would you do that's

2678
01:30:40,880 --> 01:30:45,760
tough because i'm already an introvert

2679
01:30:43,439 --> 01:30:47,198
and i try to avoid people mostly like i

2680
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:48,400
like a one-on-one

2681
01:30:47,198 --> 01:30:50,479
but uh

2682
01:30:48,399 --> 01:30:51,198
crowds and all that is tough

2683
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,279
so

2684
01:30:51,198 --> 01:30:54,719
basically unchanged yeah that's what i

2685
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:56,719
was gonna say but then that's the irony

2686
01:30:54,719 --> 01:30:58,480
is i would be so sad to not talk to

2687
01:30:56,719 --> 01:31:00,719
anybody so it's this weird

2688
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:02,559
uh bittersweet thing but

2689
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:03,840
i don't know what i would do man i guess

2690
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:06,560
it's kind of like when you're hungover

2691
01:31:03,840 --> 01:31:09,760
you just go into the primal survival

2692
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:13,440
mode i gotta get food i need water i'm

2693
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:15,360
horny jerk off you know you just go

2694
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:17,759
you're not like playing the piano or or

2695
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:19,920
painting or at the gym

2696
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:23,920
so i think i would just go into urges

2697
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:26,239
man primal urges find food store food

2698
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,920
am i safe make weapons

2699
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:30,238
build a shelter that i can't get

2700
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:32,319
attacked in i would go all survival mode

2701
01:31:30,238 --> 01:31:34,959
and then once i maybe realized if i was

2702
01:31:32,319 --> 01:31:37,039
safe or not there's no wild roaming dogs

2703
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,840
i would start exploring

2704
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:42,880
and uh you know maybe somehow get a

2705
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:45,119
vehicle and i would try to expand and

2706
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:47,199
that would be it and maybe i'd journal

2707
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:49,760
exploring to what to

2708
01:31:47,198 --> 01:31:51,678
to try to find new experiences new new

2709
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:54,079
life if there's other maybe there is

2710
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:56,880
another guy out there oh so always

2711
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:58,319
there's a possibility yeah hope

2712
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,079
and then maybe there's a better place i

2713
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:01,840
could live let's find that and then

2714
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:04,319
moving on maybe there's more food over

2715
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:06,079
here so yeah the hope would drive me

2716
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:08,319
but it would be bleak and sad and

2717
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:10,399
horrible also so what you're saying is

2718
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:13,599
you really want other people to be there

2719
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:14,879
so you can hide from them yes yes well

2720
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,039
said

2721
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:20,000
all right what uh what's an item on your

2722
01:32:17,039 --> 01:32:21,840
bucket list that you haven't done yet

2723
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,760
think about something

2724
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:25,440
you'd be very upset if you died and you

2725
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:27,760
haven't done well i'm terrified of

2726
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:29,839
having kids you know just because i'm a

2727
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:32,560
child myself and i'm i'm

2728
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:34,319
selfish and lazy in a way so kids are

2729
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:35,840
like this is your whole life now this is

2730
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:37,920
it you gotta not let this thing die you

2731
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,600
gotta love it you gotta raise it

2732
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:41,279
so kids scare the [ __ ] out of me but i

2733
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,600
also feel like if i don't have them i'll

2734
01:32:41,279 --> 01:32:45,519
i'll i'll regret it

2735
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,840
well you've seen so many people

2736
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:50,960
like you who are fundamentally changed

2737
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:53,199
by kids yeah like it's a source

2738
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:54,880
it's it's a source of like a deep source

2739
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:57,198
of happiness even though you didn't

2740
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,359
anticipate it yeah

2741
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:02,319
so you like you penciled it into your

2742
01:32:59,359 --> 01:33:05,198
bucket yes yes you're it might be on

2743
01:33:02,319 --> 01:33:08,079

i want to have kids i kind of uh

2747
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:16,319
i don't like choice so

2748
01:33:14,719 --> 01:33:18,480
in the following way like

2749
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:20,158
i appreciate the value of scarcity and

2750
01:33:18,479 --> 01:33:22,238
the power of scarcity like i don't like

2751
01:33:20,158 --> 01:33:23,839
the the modern dating culture it's not

2752
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:24,638
some religious thing whatever i just

2753
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:26,719
like

2754
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:28,480
one girl for a long time

2755
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,560
uh or at least swinging for that always

2756
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:32,559
like swinging for the fences and to be

2757
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,920
swinging right now i mean you're there's

2758
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:35,520
a different use of the word swinging

2759
01:33:33,920 --> 01:33:37,440

2760
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,440

what are you most afraid of

2773
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:02,880
i guess i'll done live life

2774
01:34:02,000 --> 01:34:05,600
uh

2775
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,480
i'm a i'm i was a big fan growing up of

2776
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,719
like

2777
01:34:06,479 --> 01:34:10,479
wild guys you know like these teddy

2778
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,079
roosevelts who would go out and hunt

2779
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:12,879
lions and

2780
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:14,960
uh

2781
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,359
like bar fighting guys i was obsessed

2782
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:18,399
with hunter s thompson types

2783
01:34:17,359 --> 01:34:21,759
and look

2784
01:34:18,399 --> 01:34:24,638
this is what i love about uh guys like

2785
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:26,480
who's a good example like hemingway

2786
01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:28,159
hemingway was the manliest guy he had

2787
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:30,000
the rifle and the elephant gun and the

2788
01:34:28,158 --> 01:34:31,519
whiskey and the writing and the women

2789
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,359
and the fistfights

2790
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,800
but people forget that the other side of

2791
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:36,639
that coin is i'm sure he was in a lot of

2792
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:38,239
hotel rooms weeping i'm sure he was

2793
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:39,679
lonely as [ __ ] i'm sure he had some

2794
01:34:38,238 --> 01:34:40,959
wicked hangovers i mean he killed

2795
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,880
himself for christ's sake so obviously

2796
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:45,359
he was dealing with something

2797
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:47,679
so the key to me is having this

2798
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:50,319
adventurous life living to the fullest

2799
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:53,600
doing crazy [ __ ] scaring yourself but

2800
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:55,519
also not killing yourself like also not

2801
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,280
hating because i used to party a lot

2802
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:00,080
hard i used to

2803
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:02,479
bang a lot of gals and this is the flip

2804
01:35:00,079 --> 01:35:04,880
side is like this girl hates you now or

2805
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:06,479
you got herpes or you're hungover or

2806
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:07,760
your mom is like where where are you you

2807
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:09,118
never call me anymore and you're like oh

2808
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:10,960
my mom i

2809
01:35:09,118 --> 01:35:12,719
let let ties go with my mom i gotta

2810
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:14,719
connect so this horrible there's a

2811
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:16,719
horrible side of the party animal the

2812
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:18,239
keith richards we don't see

2813
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:20,800
is not pretty

2814
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:22,879
i mean he's already weird-looking but

2815
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:25,119
he's partying he's smoking he's living

2816
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:27,118
but there's another side of that coin

2817
01:35:25,118 --> 01:35:29,519
and i think the key to life is

2818
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:31,439
living that [ __ ] crazy awesome badass

2819
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:33,520
life and also

2820
01:35:31,439 --> 01:35:35,839
having some

2821
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:38,239
you know meaning and and a little bit of

2822
01:35:35,840 --> 01:35:40,319
uh what's the word

2823
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:42,238
not just not killing yourself not going

2824
01:35:40,319 --> 01:35:44,719
sad not being depressed right there's a

2825
01:35:42,238 --> 01:35:47,359
medium there a sweet spot

2826
01:35:44,719 --> 01:35:48,639
does that make sense yeah yeah so taking

2827
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:50,639
big

2828
01:35:48,639 --> 01:35:53,118
leaps and uh

2829
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:54,639
hemingway grabbing life by the balls but

2830
01:35:53,118 --> 01:35:56,960
at the same time not crushing the balls

2831
01:35:54,639 --> 01:35:59,440
then yeah metaphor work it off perfect

2832
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:02,158
like evil knievel we all know him what a

2833
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:04,319
badass fearless oh man what a cool dude

2834
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:05,920
he's got balls of steel but he also

2835
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:08,639
lived like the back half of his life in

2836
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:10,560
a [ __ ] uh you know barca lounger

2837
01:36:08,639 --> 01:36:12,319
where his legs were made of steel and he

2838
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:14,800
couldn't see straight and his dick

2839
01:36:12,319 --> 01:36:16,238
didn't work so

2840
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:18,239
you know what i mean you got to have a

2841
01:36:16,238 --> 01:36:20,879
balance but you still want the balance

2842
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:21,919
i'm willing to take a little bit of [ __ ]

2843
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:23,359
for

2844
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:25,520
a little bit of fun

2845
01:36:23,359 --> 01:36:27,198
but you don't want to go too hard

2846
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,880
because you got to still risk it i mean

2847
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:30,399
hunter s thompson

2848
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:34,239
it didn't end well

2849
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:36,319
yeah that's quite a ride quite a ride

2850
01:36:34,238 --> 01:36:39,759
what small act of kindness were you once

2851
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:42,319
shown that you will never forget

2852
01:36:39,760 --> 01:36:43,920

2861
01:36:56,960 --> 01:37:01,279
high school who were kind enough to hand

2862
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:02,800
job me that was nice which i really

2863
01:37:01,279 --> 01:37:04,719
appreciate i don't think women know how

you just gave me a hand job yeah i would

2868
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,840

people mention like a math teacher

2871
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,840
middle school that that would inspire

2872
01:37:17,359 --> 01:37:22,158
them to get into science you you it's

2873
01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:23,520

2911
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:48,079
my neighborhood saw the kids [ __ ]

2912
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:50,000
with the bike you know five street tuffs

2913
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:51,679
and uh he goes all right

01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:53,118
you want to come out or should i just do

2915
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:54,880

2916
01:38:53,118 --> 01:38:56,000
terrified what are you crazy

2917
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,639
and he

2918
01:38:56,000 --> 01:39:00,479
got out of the van in full you know

2919
01:38:58,639 --> 01:39:02,719
heels and wig and he went up to these

2920
01:39:00,479 --> 01:39:04,718
guys and they went off oh my god look at

2921
01:39:02,719 --> 01:39:07,118
this [ __ ] guy homo [ __ ] all this

2922
01:39:04,719 --> 01:39:08,960
[ __ ] you know it's the 90s and he just

2923
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:10,079
stared at him

2924
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:11,359
long enough to where they were kind of

2925
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:12,479
like all right well i guess we're gonna

2926
01:39:11,359 --> 01:39:14,719
fight you now

2927
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:16,158
and he goes uh that's not your bike

2928
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:17,920
and they go what are you gonna do about

2929
01:39:16,158 --> 01:39:19,839
it and he puts his hand on the middle of

2930
01:39:17,920 --> 01:39:21,520
the bike and they didn't do anything and

2931
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:23,119
he just picked it up and said that's

2932
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:25,360
what i thought put the bike over

2933
01:39:23,118 --> 01:39:28,079
shoulder slid the van door open threw

2934
01:39:25,359 --> 01:39:30,399
the bike in and we drove off

2935
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:31,840
somebody stuck up for you yeah and you

2936
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:33,920
know i mean he could have got i mean

2937
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:36,800
they have tools they could have [ __ ]

2938
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:39,920
tuned him up two seconds

2939
01:39:36,800 --> 01:39:42,320
that actually like takes courage oh yeah

2940
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:44,639
real courage and then that

2941
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:46,319
the the the reason you do an act like

2942
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:48,560
that is that

2943
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:50,319
makes a kid like you feel like

2944
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:52,560
there's somebody on your side that's

2945
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:56,079
powerful someone on your side is big

2946
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:57,760
it's big that goes a long way

2947
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:59,519
especially when they have uh the risk of

2948
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:01,840
getting their ass kicked or their job

2949
01:39:59,520 --> 01:40:04,000
taken away or whatever it is

2950
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:06,560
now we're gonna get uh

2951
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:09,560
philosophical maybe a little bit

2952
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,560
emotional

2953
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:14,239
would you rather lose all your old

2954
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:16,560
memories or never be able to make new

2955
01:40:14,238 --> 01:40:16,559
ones

2956
01:40:18,639 --> 01:40:22,719
it's a tough one but i'd go easy answer

2957
01:40:20,960 --> 01:40:24,239
make new ones

2958
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:25,920
but don't you think all the shitty

2959
01:40:24,238 --> 01:40:27,759
things that happened to you

2960
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:29,359
oh so my hard drive is wiped clean it's

2961
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,760
not

2962
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:33,039
is it memories or is it how every memory

2963
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,159
affected me

2964
01:40:33,039 --> 01:40:35,920
too

2965
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:38,079
i mean this is a very how do they go

2966
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:40,000
hand in hand i i think

2967
01:40:38,079 --> 01:40:42,158
the reality about memories is you replay

2968
01:40:40,000 --> 01:40:44,319
them often you go back to them even when

2969
01:40:42,158 --> 01:40:46,960
you're not aware of it you really go you

2970
01:40:44,319 --> 01:40:48,559
go back often like that um and they

2971
01:40:46,960 --> 01:40:50,399
change you change them too yeah you

2972
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:52,800
change them to suit

2973
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:54,719
your understanding of the world yes

2974
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:57,360
and so

2975
01:40:54,719 --> 01:40:59,118
uh the the dark view you have

2976
01:40:57,359 --> 01:41:01,279
both the hope and the cynicism you have

2977
01:40:59,118 --> 01:41:02,880
about the world is so deeply grounded in

2978
01:41:01,279 --> 01:41:05,279
the um

2979
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:08,400
in the memories that you're basically i

2980
01:41:05,279 --> 01:41:11,759
would say if you erase all memories

2981
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:13,839
i think you're really starting over

2982
01:41:11,760 --> 01:41:14,800
with maybe the wisdom of how the world

2983
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,000
works

2984
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,320
but not

2985
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,479
your so much your personality is gone

2986
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:21,840
you would really

2987
01:41:20,479 --> 01:41:23,198
um

2988
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,560
it'd be interesting how your comedy

2989
01:41:23,198 --> 01:41:27,359
would change maybe you would have a good

2990
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:31,199
sense of timing you have a good

2991
01:41:27,359 --> 01:41:33,039
sense of like the writing process maybe

2992
01:41:31,198 --> 01:41:34,399
but like

2993
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:35,840
now you're making some good points but

2994
01:41:34,399 --> 01:41:39,279
let me ask you this let's say i go to

2995
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:42,239
lake cuomo with my girlfriend

2996
01:41:39,279 --> 01:41:43,840
now like i wipe the memory or i keep my

2997
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:46,718
old memories let's say i go to you know

2998
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:48,480
the tuscany with the lady yeah

2999
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:50,480
i just won't remember that yeah but you

3000
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:52,000
get to experience it in the moment okay

3001
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:54,638
you'll get to enjoy it can i look at a

3002
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,639
photo of it

3003
01:41:55,118 --> 01:42:01,118
yes but what the hell is this exactly oh

3004
01:41:58,840 --> 01:42:02,560
fascinating it's exactly the rules are

3005
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:04,158
pretty simple yeah i think everyone

3006
01:42:02,560 --> 01:42:06,480
knows how the rules go

3007
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:08,559
see but you you would uh yeah so what uh

3008
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:10,319
well i was gonna say start new ones but

3009
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,679
then i realized i wouldn't be who i was

3010
01:42:10,319 --> 01:42:14,079
without them yeah that's what you're

3011
01:42:11,679 --> 01:42:15,920
saying so i guess i'd keep them because

3012
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:18,960
i am 38 so i've

3013
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:20,319
gotten a good chunk out of life yeah and

3014
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:23,679
let's be honest how many years do you

3015
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:25,840
have left i know right i got aids

3016
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:27,520
is it better to have loved okay this

3017
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:29,840
question is ridiculous is it better to

3018
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:32,239
have loved and lost or to have never

3019
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:34,400
loved at all the the it sounds cliche

3020
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:36,559
but yeah there's a question

3021
01:42:34,399 --> 01:42:38,559
definitely better to loss

3022
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,560
so you enjoy the ups and downs yeah

3023
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:43,840
that's what that's life

3024
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:45,760
for sun and rain baby

3025
01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:47,440
i kind of like both the whole thing the

3026
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,159
the loss

3027
01:42:47,439 --> 01:42:52,638
every time you lose something it really

3028
01:42:50,158 --> 01:42:56,158
makes you distinctly realize

3029
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:58,239
how much you valued it yes like am i

3030
01:42:56,158 --> 01:43:01,198
when i'm sad

3031
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:04,000
like when i'm feeling alone

3032
01:43:01,198 --> 01:43:05,599
and i'm sitting there alone at home

3033
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:06,560
and i wish i could hang out with

3034
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,239
somebody

3035
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:11,520
that's like a

3036
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:14,000
realization how awesome people are yeah

3037
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:15,360
so it's like the missing the

3038
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:16,560
yeah uh

3039
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:18,158
we don't have a lot of that in life

3040
01:43:16,560 --> 01:43:20,320
anymore because we can have anything we

3041
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:21,920
want immediately so the missing has gone

3042
01:43:20,319 --> 01:43:25,198
away which again

3043
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:26,960
drives down the joy of having it

3044
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:28,879
so i i

3045
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:31,039
think you're right you need both

3046
01:43:28,880 --> 01:43:33,679
uh so like you said you have a condition

3047
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:34,960
that a terminal condition not much many

3048
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:37,440
years left do you think about your

3049
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:37,439
mortality

3050
01:43:37,600 --> 01:43:42,400
all day every day are you afraid

3051
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:44,238
not afraid because it's inevitable so

3052
01:43:42,399 --> 01:43:46,399
it's more like

3053
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:47,759
how are we going to handle this

3054
01:43:46,399 --> 01:43:50,319
it's like the winner is coming let's

3055
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:52,320
stock up on some [ __ ] nuts but the

3056
01:43:50,319 --> 01:43:53,920
existential nature of it like the fact

3057
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:56,079
that this ride ends like what the hell

3058
01:43:53,920 --> 01:43:58,480
are you doing any of this for like is it

3059
01:43:56,079 --> 01:44:00,158
your satisfaction happiness

3060
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:02,399
short term but like the

3061
01:44:00,158 --> 01:44:04,479
there is a presumption there

3062
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:06,399
that it kind of goes on forever i think

3063
01:44:04,479 --> 01:44:08,079
if you truly think about the fact that

3064
01:44:06,399 --> 01:44:10,638
it ends

3065
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:11,840
um your brain almost shuts shut down

3066
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:13,600
yeah there's some kind of like

3067
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:15,760
protective like uh

3068
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:18,079
switch that just goes off i mean that's

3069
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:20,159
why the stoics

3070
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:22,158
you know encourage people to meditate on

3071
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:24,638
death because it somehow

3072
01:44:22,158 --> 01:44:25,439
reorganizes your priorities it helps you

3073
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:27,760
like

3074
01:44:25,439 --> 01:44:30,399
holy [ __ ] this ends make the most of the

3075
01:44:27,760 --> 01:44:32,840
day yes it's just a nice thing but still

3076
01:44:30,399 --> 01:44:35,118
you can't quite comprehend the thing

3077
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:37,600
ends uh little things too you know

3078
01:44:35,118 --> 01:44:39,279
people go like oh we got a layover

and like the like you said in modern day

3097
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:16,400
actually the boredom is a gift like

3098
01:45:14,319 --> 01:45:18,319
the when you're waiting for something

3099
01:45:16,399 --> 01:45:20,960
that's that's that's a gift

3100
01:45:18,319 --> 01:45:22,399
you get to be with your thoughts yeah

3101
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:24,239
those those are the same thoughts you'll

3102
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:26,799
have when you're on your deathbed

3103
01:45:24,238 --> 01:45:28,718
there won't be a

3104
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:31,039
uh you won't be scrolling tick tock on

3105
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:33,039
your deathbed i hope not jesus you'd be

3106
01:45:31,039 --> 01:45:34,639
a lot more actually maybe you would be

3107
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:37,198
what if that existed because it would be

3108
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:38,560
a good uh like content creators would be

3109
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:40,399
like oh i'm dying this would be good

3110
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:42,639
content

3111
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:45,439
yeah i want to be able to film the exact

3112
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:48,079
moment it goes like last words i wonder

3113
01:45:45,439 --> 01:45:50,799
what my last year will be yeah good way

3114
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:52,800
to like end the the account with a bang

3115
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:54,320
yep i like that well you know you ever

3116
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:57,119
seen that meme or the old guy in bed he

3117
01:45:54,319 --> 01:45:58,399
goes i wish i had tweeted more you know

3118
01:45:57,118 --> 01:46:00,719
and then he dies

3119
01:45:58,399 --> 01:46:04,158
it's so true it could be the future uh

3120
01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:04,158
what do you think is the meaning of life

3121
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:07,679
i don't think there is one

3122
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:09,600
everybody always throws that out there

3123
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:11,359
there isn't a meaning i think we're here

3124
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:13,280
we're lucky to be here i think there's

3125
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:14,799
no afterlife there's no heaven that's

3126
01:46:13,279 --> 01:46:17,759
that's all [ __ ] we tell ourselves to

3127
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:19,760
feel better and i think you gotta just

3128
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:20,960
it's like saying what is the meaning of

3129
01:46:19,760 --> 01:46:21,760
this

3130
01:46:20,960 --> 01:46:23,118
uh

3131
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:25,039
food i made

3132
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:27,359
well it's just you enjoy the food you

3133
01:46:25,039 --> 01:46:30,000
try to get the most out of it you

3134
01:46:27,359 --> 01:46:30,799
you built the food you've prepared it

3135
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:31,600
so

3136
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:33,279
just

3137
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:35,119
get what you can out of it

3138
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:37,039
don't die

3139
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:38,399
and try to make it last as long as

3140
01:46:37,039 --> 01:46:40,319
possible

3141
01:46:38,399 --> 01:46:42,399
yeah but you look at earth it's like

3142
01:46:40,319 --> 01:46:45,599
four billion years old

3143
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:48,158
and uh life started early on like like

3144
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:50,480
simple cell bacterial life like a one

3145
01:46:48,158 --> 01:46:52,960
billion years in and then it started

3146
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:55,279
like having lots of

3147
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:57,198
uh aggressive interaction eventually

3148
01:46:55,279 --> 01:46:59,439
there's predator and prey and then sex

3149
01:46:57,198 --> 01:47:02,559
lots of sex lots of sex oh yeah lots of

3150
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:04,079
violence oh yeah uh and then you know

3151
01:47:02,560 --> 01:47:06,320
through natural selection there's just a

3152
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:09,679
whole evolutionary process of

3153
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:11,279
of animals that have loved and lost and

3154
01:47:09,679 --> 01:47:13,199
murdered and gotten murdered and all

3155
01:47:11,279 --> 01:47:14,880
that kind of stuff and it's somehow led

3156
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:16,000
to human civilization and we're super

3157
01:47:14,880 --> 01:47:17,600
busy

3158
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:20,158
trying to create things and creating

3159
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:23,039
beautiful art creating beautiful comedy

3160
01:47:20,158 --> 01:47:25,279
yeah um just always creating something

3161
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:27,359
new it feels like it's tending down or

3162
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:28,479
something like it's it's a little not

3163
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:30,158
dying

3164
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:32,559
if you die tomorrow you still have all

3165
01:47:30,158 --> 01:47:33,679
these hours of pods so it's kind of you

3166
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:35,520
think you're cheating death in a

3167
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:38,319
subconscious way i think

3168
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:39,600
right you know who ernest becker is and

3169
01:47:38,319 --> 01:47:41,920
i've heard the name

3170
01:47:39,600 --> 01:47:43,520
um it's a book called denial of death

3171
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:46,079
this idea that

3172
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:48,320
that uh if you don't acknowledge

3173
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:50,639
what's on my shelf

3174
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:52,479
uh girls love it like

3175
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:54,319
uh no i'm just

3176
01:47:52,479 --> 01:47:56,319
i'm saying you want to bring told story

3177
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:58,559
that's the russian literature it's the

3178
01:47:56,319 --> 01:48:00,399
back to norm it's good to bring to uh

3179
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,840
because because uh

3180
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:03,599
no american has read any russian

3181
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:05,119
literature but they all appreciate it if

3182
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:06,400
you bring it and it's not like they're

3183
01:48:05,118 --> 01:48:07,599
going to ask you any legitimate

3184
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:08,960
questions because they haven't read it

3185
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:12,079
yeah so you can always pretend like

3186
01:48:08,960 --> 01:48:14,158
you've read it so it's a little dense

3187
01:48:12,079 --> 01:48:17,198
can we get a shortened version

3188
01:48:14,158 --> 01:48:18,879
cliff notes yes or make a movie with uh

3189
01:48:17,198 --> 01:48:21,279
you know ben stiller that i that i can

3190
01:48:18,880 --> 01:48:23,600
just go oh this is based on

3191
01:48:21,279 --> 01:48:26,319
what is it uh life and death no what's

3192
01:48:23,600 --> 01:48:28,880
the war and peace one piece yeah yeah

3193
01:48:26,319 --> 01:48:30,238
yeah so ernest becker's theory and

3194
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:33,118
there's this whole terror management

3195
01:48:30,238 --> 01:48:35,919
theory that basically says that like

3196
01:48:33,118 --> 01:48:37,118
our terror of death our fear of death is

3197
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:39,679
one of the

3198
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:41,519
central creative forces of the human

3199
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:44,000
condition it's the reason we're trying

3200
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:45,520
to yeah cheat death we're trying to

3201
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,520
delude ourselves that somehow we can

3202
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:49,119
become immortal through our art that's

3203
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:50,880
why you've uploaded your special to

3204
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:53,118
youtube because you think

3205
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:54,800

all of human civilization you think

3207
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:58,400

3208
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:00,639
