1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,039
brian keating experimental physicist at

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,240
ussd and author of losing the nobel

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,638
prize and into the impossible

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,960
plus he's a host of the amazing podcast

6
00:00:12,638 --> 00:00:16,879
of the same name called

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,960
into the impossible

8
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:20,960
this is the lex friedman podcast to

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,278
support it please check out our sponsors

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,359
in the description and now here's my

11
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:27,278
conversation with brian

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,760
keating

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,320
as an experimental physicist what do you

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,640
think is the most amazing or maybe the

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,960
coolest measurement device

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,439
you've ever worked with or humans have

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,120
ever built maybe for now let's

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:45,359
exclude the background imaging of cosmic

19
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:46,718
galactic polarization instruments yeah

20
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,320
i'm slightly biased towards that

21
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,160
particular instrument but talk about

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,439
that in a little bit yeah but certainly

23
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,679
the telescope to me is is a lever that

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,920
has literally moved the earth uh

25
00:00:55,679 --> 00:00:59,920
throughout history so the og telescope

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,320
og telescope yeah the one invented not

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,640
by galileo as most people think but by

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,840
this guy hans lipperche in uh in the

29
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,680
netherlands

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,719
and you know it was kind of interesting

31
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,640
because

32
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:15,359
in the 1600s 14 1500 1600s it was the

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,359
beginning of movable type and so people

34
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:19,359
for the first time in history

35
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,680
had a standard by which they could

36
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,959
appraise their eyesight so looking at a

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,960
printed word now we just take it for

38
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,319
granted 12 point font whatever and

39
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,759
that's what the eye charts are based on

40
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,359
they're just fixed height but back then

41
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,840
there were no there's no way to adjust

42
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:33,759
your eyesight if you didn't have uh you

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,960
know perfect vision and there was no way

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,519
to even tell if you had perfect vision

45
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,798
or not until the gutenberg bible and

46
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,319
movable type

47
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,759
and at that time people realized hey

48
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:43,359
wait i can't read this you know my

49
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,280
priest or my my friend over here he can

50
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,280
read it she can read it i can't read it

51
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,599
what's going on and that's when you know

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,359
these people in in venice and in the

53
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:53,359
netherlands saw that they could take

54
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,040
this kind of you know glass material and

55
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,319
hold it up and maybe put another piece

56
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,359
of glass material and it would make it

57
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:58,639
clearer

58
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,560
and what was so interesting is that

59
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,519
nobody thought to take that exact same

60
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,960
device you know two lenses and go like

61
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,039
let me go like this and look at that

62
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,439
bright thing in the sky over there uh

63
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,120
until galileo so galileo didn't invent

64
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:12,639
it but he

65
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,878
did something kind of amazing he

66
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,958
improved on it by a factor of 10. so he

67
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,799
10xed it which is almost as good as

68
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,159
going from zero to one is going from you

69
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,040
know one to ten

70
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:24,000
and

71
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:26,159
when he did that he really

72
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,318
transformed both how we

73
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,479
look at the universe and think about it

74
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,878
but also who we are as a as a species

75
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:35,759
because we're using tools not to get

76
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:38,560
food faster or to you know preserve you

77
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:41,120
know uh our our legacy for the for

78
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,640
future generations but actually to and

79
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,599
increase the benefit of to the human

80
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,839
mind

81
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,598
somebody mentioned this idea that uh

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,719
if humans weren't able to see the stars

83
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:52,799
maybe there was some some kind of

84
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,479
makeup of the atmosphere which

85
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,400
for the early humans made it impossible

86
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,079
to see the stars that we would never

87
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,158
develop human civilization or at least

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,480
raising the question of how important is

89
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:04,959
it to look up to the sky and wonder

90
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:07,439
what's out there as opposed to

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,680
um maybe this is an over romanticized

92
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:11,519
notion but like looking at the ground it

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,920
feels like a little bit too much focused

94
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,280
on survival not being eaten by a bear

95
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,799
slash lion

96
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,878
if you look up to the stars you start to

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,480
wonder what is my place in the universe

98
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,399
you think i think that's uh modern

99
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:25,518
humans romantic it's a little romantic

100
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,039
um because they also took the tribe

101
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,319
they took the same two lenses and they

102
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,079
looked inward right they looked at

103
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,039
bacteria they looked at you know hairs

104
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,519
and in other words they made the

105
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:36,000
microscope and we're still doing that

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,239
and so you know to have a telescope is

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,120
it serves a dual purpose it's it's not

108
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,840
only

109
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,519
a way of looking out it's looking in but

110
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,719
it's also looking back in time in other

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,319
words you can see a microscope you don't

112
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:47,840
say oh i'm seeing this thing as it was

113
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:50,079
you know one nanosecond ago light

114
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,439
travels one foot per nanosecond uh i'm

115
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,480
seeing it no you don't think about it

116
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,318
like that but when you see something

117
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,158
that's happening you know on jupiter the

118
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,679
moon andromeda galaxy you're seeing

119
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,158
things you know back when lucy was

120
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,799
walking around the serengeti plains and

121
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,719
for that i think that took then the

122
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,200
knowledge of you know relativity and

123
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:09,438
time travel and and so forth they took

124
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,438
that before we could really say oh we we

125
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:13,280
really unlocked some cheat codes in the

126
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,280
human brain so i think that might be a

127
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,879
little too much but but nevertheless i

128
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,560
mean what's better than having a time

129
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,238
machine you know it's like we can look

130
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,560
back in time we see things as they were

131
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,319
not as they are and that allows us to do

132
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,680
many things including speculate about

133
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:26,478
that but one of the coolest things i

134
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,160
don't know if you're familiar with

135
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:29,599
someone i'm a radio astronomer i don't

136
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
actually look through telescopes very

137
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,840
often except uh you know on rare

138
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,679
occasions when i when i take one out uh

139
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,959
to show the kids but

140
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,319
um but a radio telescope is even more

141
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,359
sort of visceral i mean it's much less

142
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,800
cool because you look at it you're like

143
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,479
all right looks cool it's kind of weird

144
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,879
shape thing looks like it belongs in

145
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,120
sci-fi it's going to blast you know

146
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,639
the death star or whatever but when you

147
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,600
when you realize that when you point a

148
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,439
radio telescope at a distant object if

149
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,439
that object fills up what's called the

150
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,439
beam which is basically the

151
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:02,240
field of view of a radio telescope is

152
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:04,160
called this beam if you fill up the beam

153
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,240
and you put a resistor just a simple

154
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,960
absorbing piece of material at the focus

155
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,038
of the radio telescope that resistor

156
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,879
will come to the exact same temperature

157
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:14,399
as the object that's looking at

158
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,159
which is pretty amazing it means you're

159
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,079
actually remotely measuring you're

160
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,039
taking the temperature of jupiter or

161
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,519
whatever in in effect and so it's it's

162
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,038
it's allowing you to basically teleport

163
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,240
and there's no other science that you

164
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,000
can really do that right if you're an

165
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,400
archaeologist you can let me get into my

166
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,160
you know my time machine and go back and

167
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,000
see what was lucy really like you know

168
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,919
it's not possible so this the same thing

169
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,439
happens this is where i learned about

170
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,359
this from march of the penguins when the

171
00:05:37,439 --> 00:05:41,038
penguins huddle together

172
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,160
they uh you know the the body

173
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:43,599
temperature

174
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,199
arrives to the same place so you're

175
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,960
you're doing this remotely that's like

176
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,400
the march of the penguins but remote we

177
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,399
do it from antarctica too so there are

178
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,799
some penguins around when we do it

179
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,359
okay excellent you uh mentioned time

180
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,960
machine i think in your book losing the

181
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,479
nobel prize

182
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,318
you talk about

183
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:02,079
time machines so let me ask you the

184
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,960
question of uh

185
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,120
uh

186
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:08,560
take us back in time what happened at

187
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,079
the beginning of our universe ah okay

188
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,319
usually people preface this by saying i

189
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,519
have a simple question so uh you know is

190
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,840
this so you know what happened before

191
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,240
the universe began what happened

192
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:19,918
teaching me about comedy

193
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,079
i have a simple question for you let's

194
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,198
take two i have a simple question what

195
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:25,599
happened at the beginning of our

196
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,080
universe there you go all right good so

197
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,639
when we think about what what happened

198
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,359
it's more correct it's more logical it's

199
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,160
more uh practical to go back in time

200
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,720
starting from today so if you go back

201
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,560
uh

202
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,840
13.874 billion years from today that's

203
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
some day right i mean you could

204
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:46,318
translate into some day right so on that

205
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,319
day something happened uh earlier than

206
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,759
than you know than the the moment

207
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,720
exactly now let's say we're talking

208
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
around

209
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,560
one o'clock

210
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,399
so at some point during that day uh the

211
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,720
universe started to become a fusion

212
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,560
reactor it started to fuse light

213
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
elements and isotopes into heavier

214
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,038
elements and isotopes of those heavier

215
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,959
elements

216
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,719
um after that period of time you know

217
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,560
going forward back closer to today less

218
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,000
you know 10 minutes earlier 10 minutes

219
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,000
earlier

220
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,120
later rather coming towards us today we

221
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,038
know more and more about what the

222
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,959
universe was like and in fact all the

223
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,120
hydrogen you know it's a very good

224
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:20,719
approximation in the water molecules in

225
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,639
this bottle almost all of them were

226
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,520
produced during that first 20 minute

227
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,680
period

228
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:26,639
so i would say you know the actual

229
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
fusion

230
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,478
and production of the lightest elements

231
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,319
on the periodic table

232
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,478
occurred in a time period shorter than

233
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,400
the tv show the big bang theory well

234
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,159
done sir

235
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,079
you know most of those light elements

236
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,680
besides hydrogen aren't really used in

237
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,680
your you know in your encounter right we

238
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,519
don't encounter helium that often unless

239
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,000
you go to a lot of birthday parties or

240
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,839
pilot a blimp um you don't need lithium

241
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,959
hopefully uh you know but but other than

242
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:52,318
that those are the kind of things that

243
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:53,839
were produced during that moment the

244
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,840
question became how do the heavier

245
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,439
things like iron carbon nickel we can

246
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,399
get to that later and i brought some

247
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,478
samples

248
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,159
for us to discuss and how those came

249
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,519
from a very different type of process

250
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,080
called a different type of fusion

251
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:08,399
reactor and a different type of process

252
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,240
explosion as well called a supernova

253
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,399
however if you go back to the beyond

254
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,038
those first three minutes we really have

255
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:17,359
to say almost nothing because we are not

256
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:19,199
capable in other words going backwards

257
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,759
from the first three minutes as famous

258
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
stephen weinberg titled his book

259
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,000
we actually marks a point where

260
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,478
ignorance takes over in other words we

261
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,319
can't speculate on what happened three

262
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:32,399
minutes before the preponderance of

263
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:34,639
hydrogen was formed in our universe we

264
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,559
just don't know enough about that epoch

265
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,639
there are many people most people most

266
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,079
practicing card-carrying cosmologists

267
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:41,918
believe the universe began in what's

268
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,320
called the singularity

269
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,319
and we can certainly talk about that

270
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,040
however singularity is so far removed

271
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,879
from anything we can ever hope to prove

272
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,159
hope to confront or hope to observe as

273
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,759
evidence

274
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,838
and really only occurs in two

275
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,600
instantiations the big bang and the core

276
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,000
of a black hole neither of which is

277
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,920
observable um and so for that reason

278
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,839
there are now flourishing alternatives

279
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:06,479
that say you can actually for the first

280
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:09,040
time ask the question that day you know

281
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,200
tuesday you know in the first

282
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,278
moments of the our universe there was a

283
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,399
tuesday a week before that

284
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:19,120
24 hours time seven days before that

285
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,559
that has a perfectly well understood

286
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,240
meaning in models of cosmology promoted

287
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,399
by some of the more eminent of

288
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,879
cosmologists working today when i was in

289
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,480
grad school over 25 years ago no one

290
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:32,879
really considered anything besides that

291
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,039
big bang that there was a singularity

292
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,399
and people would have to say as i said

293
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,399
we just don't know

294
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,919
um but they would say some future in you

295
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,080
know incarnation of some experiment will

296
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:44,240
tell us the answer but now they're

297
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,320
people that are saying there is an

298
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,879
alternative to the big bang and it's not

299
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,440
really fringe science as it once was

300
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:54,320
50 80 years ago when these models by the

301
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,399
way the first cosmology in history was

302
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,399
not a singular universe the first

303
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,278
cosmology in history goes back to

304
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:04,399
akhenaten ra and and the temples of of

305
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,919
egypt in the third millennium bc and in

306
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,839
that they talked about cyclical

307
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:09,919
universes so i always joke you know that

308
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,920
guy akhenaten's court you know he'd have

309
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,919
a pretty high h index right about now

310
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,479
because people have been using that

311
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,199
cyclical model from penrose to paul

312
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,600
steinhardt and aegis and

313
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,680
right up until this very moment can you

314
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,519
maybe explore the

315
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:28,078
possible alternatives

316
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,639
to uh the big bang theory so there are

317
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:33,039
many alternatives um starting with so

318
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:35,120
the singularity quantum cosmologically

319
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,278
demanding singular

320
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,679
origin of the universe that stands in

321
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:42,879
contrast to these other models in which

322
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,958
time does not have a beginning

323
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,519
many of them feature cycles at least one

324
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,838
cycle possibly infinite number of cycles

325
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,278
um called by sir roger penrose and uh

326
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,839
they all have things in common these

327
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,919
alternatives as does the dominant

328
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,320
paradigm of cosmogenesis which is

329
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:01,039
inflation inflation is sort of can be

330
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,560
thought of as this a spark that ignites

331
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:04,799
the hot big bang that i said we

332
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,879
understood so it's an earlier condition

333
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,958
but it's still not an initial condition

334
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,879
in physics imagine imagine i i show you

335
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,479
a grandfather clock or pendulum swinging

336
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,639
back and forth you look away for a

337
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,079
second you know i can come into the room

338
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:18,319
pendulum swinging back and forth alex

339
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,919
tell me where did it start how how many

340
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
cycles is going to make before the er

341
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:23,599
you can't answer that question without

342
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,360
knowing the initial conditions in a very

343
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,720
simple system like a one dimensional

344
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
simple harmonic oscillator like a

345
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,399
pendulum think about understanding the

346
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,639
whole universe without understanding the

347
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,200
initial conditions it's a tremendous

348
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,360
lacunae gap that we have as scientists

349
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,600
that we may not be able to in the

350
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,759
inflationary cosmology

351
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,680
determine the quantitative physical

352
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,679
properties of the universe prior to

353
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,359
what's called the inflationary epoch so

354
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,919
you're saying for the pendulum in that

355
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,839
epoch we can't because uh you can infer

356
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,039
things about the panel before you show

357
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,519
up to the room

358
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:57,360
in our current epic correct right yeah

359
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,799
so if you look at it right now but if i

360
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,079
said well when will it stop oscillating

361
00:11:58,799 --> 00:12:02,000
so that depends on how much energy it

362
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,519
got initially and you can measure its

363
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,720
dissipation its air resistance you had

364
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,399
infrared camera you can see it's getting

365
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,040
hotter maybe and you could do some

366
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,240
calculations but to know the two things

367
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:11,599
in physics to solve a partial

368
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,120
differential equation are the initial

369
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,240
conditions and the boundary conditions

370
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,839
battery conditions were here on earth

371
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,680
has a gravitational field it's not going

372
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:18,880
to excurse or you know make excursions

373
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,599
you know wildly beyond the length of the

374
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:24,639
pendulum it's not um you know it has

375
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,639
simple properties um so but and this is

376
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,480
like in other words you can't tell me

377
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,320
you know when did the solar system start

378
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,680
orbiting in the way that it does now in

379
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,440
other words when did the moon acquire

380
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:34,319
the exact angular momentum that it has

381
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,240
now

382
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,560
um now that's a pretty pedestrian

383
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,600
example but what i'm telling you is that

384
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:43,919
the inflationary epoch purports and is

385
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,000
successful at providing a lot of

386
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,240
explanations for how the universe

387
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,639
evolved after inflation took place and

388
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,959
ended but it says nothing about how it

389
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,120
itself took place and that's really what

390
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:57,039
you're asking me i mean you don't real

391
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,879
look what you care about like big bad

392
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,799
nucleosynthesis and the elements got

393
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,320
made and these fusion reactors and and

394
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:04,078
the whole universe was a fusion reaction

395
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,720
but like don't you really care about

396
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:09,120
what happened at the beginning of time

397
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,440
at the first moment of time and the

398
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,679
problem is we can't really answer that

399
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,040
in the context of the big bang we can't

400
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:16,638
answer that in the context of these

401
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,078
alternatives so you asked me about some

402
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,919
of the alternatives so one is aeon

403
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:22,078
theory the conformal cyclic cosmology of

404
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:24,240
sir roger penrose another one that's

405
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,799
that's um it was was really popular in

406
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,959
the 60s and 70s until the discovery of

407
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,479
the primary component of my research

408
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:32,319
field the cosmic microwave background

409
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,879
radiation or cmb the three kelvin

410
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,680
all-pervasive signal that astronomers

411
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:39,759
detected in 1965 that kind of spelled

412
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,838
the death knell in some sense to the

413
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,919
what was called the quasi-steady-state

414
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,639
universe

415
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,198
and

416
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,440
and then there was another

417
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,278
uh a model that kind of came out of that

418
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,040
you hear the word quasi so it's not

419
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:54,958
steady state steady state means always

420
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,799
existed that was a cosmology einstein

421
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,838
believed until hubble showed him

422
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,799
evidence for the expansion of the

423
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:02,720
universe um and most scientists believed

424
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,078
in that for you know millennia basically

425
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,360
the universe was eternal static

426
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:06,958
unchanging

427
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,320
um they couldn't believe that after

428
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,599
hubble so they had to

429
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,440
append onto it concatenate this uh this

430
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,759
new feature that it wasn't steady it was

431
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,440
quasi-steady so the universe was making

432
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:20,240
a certain amount of hydrogen every

433
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,680
century in a given volume of space and

434
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,919
that amount of hydrogen that was

435
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,359
produced was constant but because it was

436
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,039
producing more and more every century as

437
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,959
centuries pile up and the volume piles

438
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:30,799
up the universe could expand and so

439
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,399
that's how they develop slowly very

440
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,639
slowly and it doesn't match

441
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,078
observational evidence so but that is a

442
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,240
an alternative by the way did i say i

443
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,719
think the the the steady state universe

444
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,959
is infinite or finite do you know um

445
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,800
he i i would assume that he thought it

446
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,278
was infinite because there was really

447
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,039
you know if if something had a no

448
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:50,879
beginning in time then it'll be very

449
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:53,278
unlikely we're in like the center of it

450
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,039
or it's bounded or it has in that case a

451
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,559
finite edge to it i wonder what he

452
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,480
thought about infinity because that's

453
00:14:56,559 --> 00:14:59,679
such an uncomfortable is this a silly

454
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,920
joke i'm sure you're familiar with a

455
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,759
silly joke right a silly joke was that

456
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,240
um there are only two things that are

457
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,759
infinite um the universe and human

458
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,240
stupidity and i'm not sure about the

459
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:12,480
universe so well me saying i'm not aware

460
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,399
of the joke is a good example of the

461
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,000
joke it's very meta

462
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,600
okay so uh

463
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,039
all right so sorry you were saying about

464
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,480
quasi

465
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,639
all the alternatives in the quasi-steady

466
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,159
state and and the most kind of promising

467
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,839
although i hate to say that you know

468
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,600
people say like what's your favorite you

469
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,360
know alternative right this is not

470
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,879
investment advice

471
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:35,919
inflation is not transitory it is quasi

472
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,600
permanent um so a very prominent sorry

473
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,838
to interrupt we're talking about cosmic

474
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,440
inflation so calm down cryptocurrency

475
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,600
folks that's right although the first

476
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,519
nobel prize uh and one of the first

477
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,360
nobel prizes in economics was awarded

478
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,039
for inflation not of the cosmological

479
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,480
kind uh so most people don't know that

480
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:52,000
inflation has already won a nobel prize

481
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,120
it's a good topic to work on if you want

482
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,278
a nobel prize doesn't matter the field

483
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,759
exactly it's time translation invariant

484
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,838
so when we look at um the alternative

485
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,440
that's called the bouncing or cyclic

486
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,920
cosmologies these have serious virtues

487
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,920
um according to some

488
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,399
one of the virtues to me just as a human

489
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,958
i'm just speaking uh you know as a human

490
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,759
um one of the founders of the new

491
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:20,159
version of the um of the cyclic

492
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,399
cosmology called called the bouncing

493
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,159
cosmology is paul steinhardt

494
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,759
he's the einstein professor of natural

495
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:26,879
sciences at princeton university you may

496
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,600
have heard of it

497
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,078
and he was one of the originators of

498
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,199
what was called new inflation

499
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,239
in other words he was one of the

500
00:16:33,198 --> 00:16:39,198
founding fathers of inflation who now

501
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,198
not only has no belief or support for

502
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:42,399
inflation he actively claims that

503
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:46,000
inflation

504
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:48,639
is baroque pernicious dangerous

505
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,839
malevolent not to science not just to

506
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,399
cosmology but to society so here's a man

507
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,160
who created a theory that's captivated

508
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:58,320
the world or universe of cosmologists

509
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,519
such as it is not a huge universe but

510
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,160
they're more podcasters than

511
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,759
cosmologists uh some do both but uh but

512
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,599
this this man

513
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,078
created this this theory with

514
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:10,000
collaborators and now he's like i joke

515
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,078
i'm like paul you're denying paternity

516
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
like you're like a deadbeat dad now

517
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:14,959
you're saying like inflation's is is

518
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,439
bogus

519
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,600
oh and but he doesn't just attack see

520
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,798
this is what's very important about

521
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,838
um approaching things as an

522
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,599
experimentalist you got a lot of

523
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:25,240
theorists on and that's wonderful and i

524
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,678
think that's a huge service an

525
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:30,079
experimentalist has to say no

526
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,720
he or she has to be confident to say

527
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:35,199
like i don't care if i prove you right

528
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,038
or i prove your enemy wrong or whatever

529
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,798
we have to be like exterminators and

530
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,798
nobody likes the exterminator until they

531
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:43,440
need one right or the garbage collectors

532
00:17:40,798 --> 00:17:46,000
right but it's vital that we be

533
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,240
completely kind of unpersuaded by the

534
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
beauty and the magnificence and the

535
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:52,240
symmetry and the simplicity of some idea

536
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,319
like inflation is a beautiful idea

537
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,160
but it also has consequences and what

538
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,240
paul claims i don't agree with him fully

539
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,759
on this point is that those consequences

540
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,759
are dangerous because they lead to

541
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:04,000
things like the multiverse which is

542
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,599
outside the purview of science and in

543
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,519
that sense i can

544
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,079
see support for what he does but none of

545
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:12,720
that detracts from my respect for a man

546
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:14,399
um you know imagine like you know elon

547
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,240
comes up with this like really great

548
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,919
idea you know space and then he's like

549
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,519
actually it's not it's not going to work

550
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,960
and you know but like here's this better

551
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,400
idea and he's like spacex is not going

552
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,798
to work but he's now creating an

553
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,559
alternative to it it's it's extremely

554
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,639
hard to do what paul has done doesn't

555
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:30,879
mean he's right doesn't mean i'm gonna

556
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,799
like have more and more attention paid

557
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,440
to it because he's my friend or because

558
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,960
i respect the idea or i respect the man

559
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,798
um and his colleague anna aegis who

560
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,480
works really hard with him

561
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:43,599
but nevertheless this has certain

562
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,079
attractions to it and what um what it

563
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:48,159
does most foremost is that it removes

564
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,599
the quantum gravity aspect from

565
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,200
cosmology

566
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,879
so it takes away

567
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,960
50 percent of the motivation for a

568
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,000
theory of quantum gravity

569
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,160
you've talked a lot about quantum

570
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,319
gravity uh you talk people eminent

571
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,558
people on the show always latent in

572
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:05,200
those conversations is sort of the

573
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:07,599
teleological expectation that there is a

574
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:09,519
theory of everything there is a theory

575
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,119
of quantum gravity but there's there's

576
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,519
no law that says we have to have a

577
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:16,479
theory of quantum gravity so that that

578
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:19,038
kind of uh implicit expectation has to

579
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,240
do ultimately with the inflationary

580
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,879
theory so in cosmic inflation so is that

581
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,919
at the core so okay uh maybe you can

582
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,600
speak to what is uh the negative impacts

583
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,400
on society

584
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:33,839
from

585
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,840
uh believing in in cosmic inflation so

586
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,240
you know one of the more kind of robust

587
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:40,000
predictions of inflation according to

588
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,599
its other two patriarchs you know

589
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,400
considered to be as patriarchs alan guth

590
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,240
at mit and andre linde at stanford um

591
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,880
although he was in the ussr when he came

592
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,519
up with these ideas um uh along with

593
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,320
paul steinhardt was that the universe

594
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:57,038
has to eventually get into a quantum

595
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,319
state uh it has to exist in this hilbert

596
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,160
space and the hebrew space has certain

597
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:01,279
features and those features are quantum

598
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,000
mechanical endowed with quantum

599
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,240
mechanical properties um and then it

600
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,119
becomes very difficult to turn inflation

601
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,359
off

602
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:11,359
so inflation can get started but then

603
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:12,959
it's it's like one of you know spacex

604
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,119
rockets it's hard to turn off a solid

605
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,720
rocket booster right it continues the

606
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:19,439
thrusting energy you need another

607
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:21,120
mechanism to douse the flames of the

608
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,200
inflationary expansion

609
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,439
which means that if inflation kicks off

610
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,640
somewhere it will kick off potentially

611
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,880
everywhere at all times including now

612
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,240
spawning an ever increasing

613
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,320
set of universes some will die stillborn

614
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,798
some will continue and flourish and this

615
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,798
is known as the multiverse paradigm it's

616
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,440
a robust seemingly robust consequence

617
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:44,798
not only of inflationary cosmology but

618
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,480
more and more we're seeing it in string

619
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,558
theory as well so that you know

620
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,640
sometimes two you know branches coming

621
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,798
to the same conclusion is you know taken

622
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,759
as evidence for its reality so one of

623
00:20:52,798 --> 00:20:57,679
the negative consequences is it creates

624
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,480
phenomena that we can't uh that are

625
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,159
outside the reach of experimental

626
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,919
science yeah or is it that the

627
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,760
multiverse somehow

628
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,759
has a philosophical

629
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,640
negative effect on humanity like it

630
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:13,038
makes us um

631
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,640
maybe makes life seem more meaningless

632
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,960
is that is that is that where he's

633
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,360
getting at a little bit or is it not

634
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,679
reaching that far well no i think those

635
00:21:19,359 --> 00:21:23,759
are both kind of perceptive

636
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,519
the answer is a little both because in

637
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,359
one sense it's meant

638
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:29,279
kind of to explain this fine-tuning

639
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,119
problem that we find ourselves in a

640
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:32,798
universe that's particularly fascine

641
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,038
that has features can com you know

642
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,639
consistent with our existence and how

643
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:38,960
could we be otherwise you know the sort

644
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,520
of weak anthropic principle um on the

645
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,640
other hand it a theory that predicts

646
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,720
everything literally everything um can

647
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,159
be said to predict nothing like if i say

648
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,000
lex you know you've been working out you

649
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,360
you look like you know yeah you have

650
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,359
been yeah that's great uh you look like

651
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,759
you're you know about somewhere under 10

652
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:57,759
000 kilograms like all right yeah you're

653
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,519
right but that's horribly imprecise so

654
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:00,879
what good is that that's meaningless i

655
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,599
don't contribute any what's called

656
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,440
surprise or reduction in entropy

657
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:07,199
or you know reduction of your ignorance

658
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,159
about the system you know exactly how

659
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,159
much you weigh

660
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,080
so me telling you that tells you nothing

661
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,840
in this case it's basically saying that

662
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:16,480
we're living in a universe because the

663
00:22:13,839 --> 00:22:19,199
overwhelming odds of our existence

664
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,558
um dictate that we would exist there has

665
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,558
to be at least one place that we exist

666
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:25,279
but the problem is um it's a

667
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,200
manifestation of infinity so humans

668
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,440
and and i'm sure you know this from your

669
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,400
work with with ai and ml and everything

670
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,798
else um that humans

671
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,280
as far as we know really are the only

672
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:39,918
entities capable of contemplating

673
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,839
infinity but we do so very imperfectly

674
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:43,600
right so if i say to you like what's

675
00:22:41,839 --> 00:22:45,279
bigger the number of you know water

676
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:46,959
molecules and and this thing or the

677
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:48,079
number of real numbers or if i say

678
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,519
what's bigger the number of real numbers

679
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,038
are rational numbers they're all

680
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:53,038
different classifications of the amount

681
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:54,558
of infinities that there could be

682
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:55,679
infinity to the infinity power you know

683
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,200
when you have kids someday they'll tell

684
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,280
you i love you infinity you have to come

685
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,679
back i love you infinity plus one right

686
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:04,079
so uh but the human brain can't really

687
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,038
contemplate infinity let me illustrate

688
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:07,678
that

689
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:10,079
they say in the singularity the universe

690
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,519
it had an infinite temperature

691
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:12,720
right so

692
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:14,720
let me ask you a question is there

693
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,798
anything that you can contemplate in the

694
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,519
observe you know einstein's little clip

695
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:22,639
aside that's infinite like a physical

696
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,720
property density pressure temperature um

697
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,559
energy that's infinite

698
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,798
and if you can think of such thing i'd

699
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,480
like to know it but if you can

700
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:31,839
how does it go to infinity minus one you

701
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,720
know the opposite direction i go with my

702
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:34,000
kids

703
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,519
how does it go from like the half of

704
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,759
infinity because that's still infinity

705
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,599
how did it cool down how did it get more

706
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,919
and more tenuous and rarefied so now

707
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:44,399
it's only infinity over two in terms of

708
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,960
past less infinite more infinite

709
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,919
yeah i mean it's uh that's one of the

710
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,200
biggest

711
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:53,200
troubling things to me about infinity is

712
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,120
uh you can't truly hold it inside our

713
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:57,440
minds it's a mathematical construct that

714
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,038
doesn't it feels like intuition fails

715
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,960
and but nevertheless we use it

716
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:03,919
nonchalantly and then

717
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,000
use like physicists they're incredible

718
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:07,919
intuition machines and then they'll play

719
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,679
with this infinity as if

720
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,200
they can play with it and the level of

721
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,240
intuition as opposed to the level of

722
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,000
math

723
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,679
you know yeah maybe something cyclical

724
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:19,359
you can imagine infinity just going

725
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:21,519
around the same um kind of like a mobius

726
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:23,918
strip situation

727
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,319
but then the question then arises how do

728
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,840
you make it more or less infinite uh

729
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:29,599
yeah all of that intuition fails

730
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,359
completely and i mean how do you

731
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:33,439
represent it in a computer right it's

732
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:35,278
either some placeholder for infinity or

733
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,640
it's one divided by a very the smallest

734
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:38,480
you know possible

735
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,919
um you know real number that you can

736
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:42,480
represent in the memory well that's

737
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,240
basically my undergraduate study in

738
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,079
computer science is how to represent a

739
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,079
floating point in a computer i think i

740
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:49,918
took 17 courses on this topic it was

741
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,639
very useful i came to the right place

742
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,080
but um but you know in terms of what a

743
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,559
physicist will mean you're right i mean

744
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,720
physicists will blindly nonchalantly

745
00:24:56,558 --> 00:24:59,918
subtract infinity you know

746
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,960
renormalization and do things to get

747
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:04,960
finite answers and it's it's miraculous

748
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,000
but you know at a certain point you have

749
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,600
to ask well where what are the

750
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,440
consequences for the real world so one

751
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:11,759
of them you ask you know what what's the

752
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,360
problem does it make us more meaningless

753
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,440
they report many of the people that

754
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,639
support it like andre linde in fact

755
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,038
andre linde says you have a bias you lex

756
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,880
me brian you have a bias that you

757
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:24,879
believe in a universe

758
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,278
but shouldn't you believe in a in a

759
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,480
multiverse wha what evidence do you have

760
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:30,400
that there's not

761
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,759
so he turns it around whereas paul

762
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,679
steinhardt will say

763
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:35,839
no if anything can happen then there's

764
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:37,440
no predictive power within the theory

765
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,519
because you can always say well this

766
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,400
value of the inflationary field did not

767
00:25:39,519 --> 00:25:44,480
pred produce sufficient uh gravitational

768
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,240
wave energy for us to detect it with

769
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,440
bicep or simon's observatory or whatever

770
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,120
but that doesn't mean that inflation

771
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,200
didn't happen and that's logically a

772
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:52,639
hundred percent correct but it's like

773
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,440
it's like kind of chewing you know

774
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,400
wonder wonder bread you know uh i

775
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,960
apologize if they're one of your

776
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,080
sponsors but you know

777
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,159
wonder bread slash flex dot com typhoon

778
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:05,759
code cleb right isn't it

779
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,600
it's my favorite russian word it's like

780
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,798
would you like a piece of wood

781
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:13,278
by the way even that uh that word clip

782
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:15,759
which means bread and russian as you say

783
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,599
it like you're jokingly saying it now

784
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,440
it made me hungry because it made me

785
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:20,959
remember how much i loved bread when i

786
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,120
was in the soviet union when you were

787
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:24,480
like hungry that was the sor that was

788
00:26:23,119 --> 00:26:26,479
the things you dreamed about i don't

789
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,200
know you know what's amazing is how many

790
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:31,919
of the soviet scientists contributed to

791
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,360
so much of what we understand today

792
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,559
and they were completely in hiding like

793
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,240
there was no google they couldn't look

794
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,759
up on scholar they had nothing they had

795
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,679
to wait for journals to get approved by

796
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,599
the communist party to get approved and

797
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,278
then and then and only then if they

798
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:45,119
weren't a member of some class i'm sure

799
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:47,119
you know like jewish scientists you had

800
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,839
a passport that said jew on your

801
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,558
passport yeah and zeldovich the famous

802
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:54,480
um yaakov

803
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,038
he was the advisor one of my advisors

804
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,440
alexander palmer of um and

805
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,200
he had to only because he was like at a

806
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,798
nobel level and you know was one of the

807
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,519
fathers of the soviet atomic bomb

808
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:08,000
program could he even get his jewish

809
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,519
student he was jewish too but but only

810
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,359
by virtue of his standing of his

811
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,599
intellectual accomplishments would they

812
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:15,359
give him the dispensation to let his

813
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,439
student you know travel to georgia or

814
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,439
something and it makes what we complain

815
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,840
about and i complain about academia and

816
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,399
it's like oh well what can i talk about

817
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:25,759
we have no idea of how good it is and

818
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:27,678
that they were able to create things

819
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,960
like inflation completely isolated from

820
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:30,480
the west i mean some of these people

821
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,919
wouldn't didn't meet like people like

822
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,200
stephen hawking until you know he was

823
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,880
almost dead

824
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,440
and they just learned this thing through

825
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,440
smuggled in you know it's it's a work of

826
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,038
heroism especially in cosmology there's

827
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,320
so many cosmologists that worked

828
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:44,000
incredibly hard probably because they

829
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:45,519
were working the they could they could

830
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,200
pass off as well we're doing stuff for

831
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,240
the atomic bomb program as well which

832
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,798
they were at the same time there is uh

833
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,798
interesting uh incentives in the soviet

834
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:57,759
system that maybe you can take this

835
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,798
tangent uh for a brief moment

836
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,558
that

837
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,480
because there's a dictatorship

838
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,839
authoritarian regime throughout the the

839
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,599
history of the 20th century for the

840
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,759
soviet union

841
00:28:05,599 --> 00:28:10,639
science was prioritized

842
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,158
and because the state prioritized it

843
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,559
through the propaganda machine to the

844
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,480
news and so on it actually was really

845
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:18,319
cool to be a scientist like you were

846
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,759
highly valued in society maybe that's a

847
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:20,480
better way to say it

848
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:22,640
and

849
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,798
i i would say you're saying like we have

850
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,960
it easy now in that sense

851
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,398
it was kind of um

852
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,399
beneficial to be a scientist in that

853
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:32,879
society because you were seen as a hero

854
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,719
as there's there's yeah there's hero of

855
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,399
the soviet republic and that you know

856
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,399
there's positives

857
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:39,678
to that i mean i'm not saying i would

858
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:42,158
take the

859
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,000
negatives or the positives but it is

860
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,399
interesting to see a world in which

861
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,798
science was highly prized

862
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,158
in um in the capitalist system or maybe

863
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,119
not capitalists let's just say the

864
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,840
american system the celebrities

865
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:58,879
are the the athletes the actors and

866
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,439
actresses maybe

867
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,240
business leaders musicians

868
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,000
uh

869
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,880
and you know the people we elect are

870
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,960
sort of

871
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,278
lawyers and

872
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,079
lawyers

873
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:12,159
so

874
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:14,480
it's interesting to think of a world

875
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,720
where science was highly prized but they

876
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,038
had to do that science

877
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,440
within the constraints of always having

878
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,038
big brother watching it's uh yeah the

879
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,558
same in germany germany had you know

880
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:27,599
highly prized i mean one of the most

881
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:29,278
famous tragic to me cases is fritz haber

882
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,959
who invented the you know hebrew bosch

883
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,558
process that allowed us to i don't know

884
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,480
have you eaten yet you look he looks i

885
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,319
mean i know you fast intermittent fast

886
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,000
every day and you do that you know i

887
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,558
said cleb and you got it's a little

888
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,359
drool but he says i'm lifting and i look

889
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,879
slim this is amazing i'm gonna clip this

890
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:46,639
out and put it on tinder i think that's

891
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,720
a website you gotta go swipe left or

892
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,640
right for that i don't know um but when

893
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,640
you think about like you know what he

894
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,799
did and created the fertilizer process

895
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:56,240
that we all enjoy and we eat from every

896
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,319
day

897
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,000
he was a german nationalist first and

898
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,678
foremost even though he was a jew

899
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,759
and he personally went to witness the

900
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,120
application of ammonia chlorine gas

901
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:08,640
applied during trench warfare in 1916 in

902
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,239
battles in brussels and whatever and he

903
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,399
was they had a whole conjure of nobel

904
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,679
laureates in chemistry and physics

905
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:15,678
you know that would go and witness these

906
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,480
atrocities but that was also they were

907
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,159
they were almost putting science above i

908
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,120
don't want to say human dignity but but

909
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,039
of like

910
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:25,199
who the fact that he would later be

911
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:27,759
suppressed and actually some of his um

912
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,840
relatives would die in auschwitz because

913
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:31,359
of the chemical that he invented also

914
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,879
called zyklon b

915
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:35,119
and so it's just it's just unbelievable

916
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,600
so i i feel like that does have

917
00:30:35,119 --> 00:30:39,918
resonance today in this worship of of

918
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,599
science you know and listen to science

919
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,480
and follow the science which is more

920
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:46,398
like scientism um and there is still a

921
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,839
danger you know i always say

922
00:30:46,398 --> 00:30:49,439
um just because you're an atheist

923
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,199
doesn't mean you don't have a religion

924
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,440
you know just because you you you know

925
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,960
and in my case in my books i i talk a

926
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,960
lot about the nobel prize it's kind of

927
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,640
like a kosher idol it's something that

928
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,880
you can worship you know it doesn't do

929
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,480
any harm and and we want those people

930
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,679
that are so significant in their

931
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,079
intellectual accomplishments because

932
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,080
there is a core of america and the

933
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,839
western world in general that does

934
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:10,879
worship and really look at science

935
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,879
predominantly because it gives us

936
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,240
technology um

937
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,480
but there's something really cool about

938
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,880
that and so for me it's hard to find

939
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,798
that balance point between um between

940
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,159
looking to science for wisdom which i

941
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,200
don't think it has they're two different

942
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,120
words um but but also recognizing how

943
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,240
much good and transformative power may

944
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:32,479
be our only hope comes from science

945
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,200
you open so many doors

946
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:37,278
because you also bring up our

947
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,798
ernest becker

948
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:41,278
in that book

949
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:44,000
so there there's a lot of elements of

950
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:46,880
religiosity to science and to the nobel

951
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,240
prize it's fascinating to explore and we

952
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,519
will

953
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,679
and we still haven't finished the

954
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,000
discussion of the beginning of the

955
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:57,278
of the universe which we'll return to

956
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,000
but now since you opened the book

957
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:01,278
wow pun unintended of uh losing the

958
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,240
nobel prize

959
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:06,798
can you uh tell me the story of bicep

960
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,038
the background imaging of cosmic

961
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:11,759
extra galactic polarization experiment

962
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,759
bicep one and bicep two and then maybe

963
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,158
you can talk about bicep three but the

964
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,640
the thing that you cover in your book

965
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,039
the human story of it yeah what happened

966
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,640
yeah that book is in contradiction in

967
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,480
the second book that's like a memoir

968
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,799
it's it's really a description

969
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,440
of uh of what it's like to feel what it

970
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:32,079
feels like to be a scientist and to come

971
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,080
up with the ignorance uncertainty

972
00:32:32,079 --> 00:32:36,720
impostor syndrome which which i cover in

973
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:39,759
the later book in more detail but um to

974
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,159
really feel like you're doing something

975
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,319
uh and it's all you think about it it is

976
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,760
all-consuming and it's something i

977
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:47,759
couldn't have done now because i have

978
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:50,558
too many other you know wonderful

979
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,319
delightful demands of my time but to go

980
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:54,480
back to that moment when i was first

981
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:57,439
captivated by the night sky who was a 12

982
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,440
year old 13 year old and really

983
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,200
mixed together throughout my scientific

984
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,880
story has always been wanting to

985
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,319
approach the greatest mystery of all

986
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,200
which i think is the existence or

987
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:09,119
non-existence of god so i call myself a

988
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,399
practicing agnostic

989
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,678
i do things

990
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:15,918
that are that religious people do and i

991
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,679
don't do things that atheist people do

992
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:19,038
and i once had this conversation you

993
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,480
know with my first podcast guest

994
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:21,759
actually i shouldn't say oh i was just

995
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,519
just having a conversation with freeman

996
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:26,319
dyson but he was actually my first guest

997
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,000
yeah and i miss him name drop name drop

998
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,639
yes uh i'm sure there's going to be

999
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,359
plenty of comments so in case people

1000
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:35,120
don't know brian keating is the host of

1001
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:36,000
into the impossible podcast where he's

1002
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,119
talked

1003
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,679
to some of the greatest scientists in uh

1004
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,278
history of science physicists especially

1005
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,960
in the history of science

1006
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,240
so when i talked to freeman i said you

1007
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,079
know freeman you're like you call

1008
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,679
yourself an agnostic too can you tell me

1009
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:51,678
something like what what do you do on

1010
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:53,440
saturday on sundays do you go to church

1011
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,440
he's like no i don't go to church

1012
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,679
and i'm like well imagine there was like

1013
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,038
an intelligent alien and he was looking

1014
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,440
down or she would

1015
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,599
see i don't know thing was looking down

1016
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,600
and i saw freeman and on sundays like a

1017
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:06,879
group of people go to church but freeman

1018
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,078
doesn't go to church and then there's

1019
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,240
another group of people that don't go to

1020
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:12,399
church and those are called atheists but

1021
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,678
freeman calls himself an agnostic but he

1022
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:15,759
does the things that the like richard

1023
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,079
dawk he doesn't go to the same church

1024
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,359
that richard dawkins doesn't go to right

1025
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,039
so i said how would you distinguish

1026
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,960
yourself if not practice so i'm a

1027
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:25,279
behaviorist i believe you can change

1028
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,679
your mentality you can you can influence

1029
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,440
your mind view your bodily physical

1030
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,878
actions so when i was a 12 year old i

1031
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,559
got my first telescope i was actually an

1032
00:34:30,878 --> 00:34:34,398
altar boy in the catholic church it's

1033
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:35,679
kind of strange for a jewish kid who

1034
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,078
grew up in new york maybe we'll get into

1035
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,240
that maybe not uh but um i was just

1036
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,039
fascinated by these

1037
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,118
these

1038
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,039
can we get into it for a second okay

1039
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,280
yeah all right let's go

1040
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,838
all right let's go there all right

1041
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,760
let's go to uh baby brian or young

1042
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:54,719
young young brother brian the new sitcom

1043
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:57,200
on cbs uh young brian born to two jewish

1044
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,799
parents uh my father was a professor at

1045
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,319
suny stoney brook he was a mathematician

1046
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,560
eminent mathematician

1047
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,320
and my mother was an eminent mom and a

1048
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:06,480
brilliant um uh

1049
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,519
english major etc

1050
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,960
and they raised that but they were

1051
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,639
secular and they think you know we'd go

1052
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,800
to i always drop we'd go to we'd go to

1053
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:15,118
synagogue you know two times a year on

1054
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,800
christmas and easter no we would go uh

1055
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,280
yeah yom kippur rosh hashanah right

1056
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,800
that's the typical two-day year jews uh

1057
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,359
and you know we'd have uh we'd have

1058
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,680
matzahs once a year on pound passover uh

1059
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,199
and that was about it and um for years i

1060
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,679
was like that until my parents got

1061
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,118
divorced my mother remarried and she

1062
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,879
married an irish catholic man by the

1063
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,320
name of ray keating my father's name is

1064
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,680
james axe um so when she remarried ray

1065
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,160
keating

1066
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,319
i was immediately adopted i'm actually

1067
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:44,639
adopted into the keating family

1068
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:46,800
and he had nine brothers and sisters

1069
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:49,358
and just warm and gregarious they you

1070
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,560
know did christmas and easter

1071
00:35:49,358 --> 00:35:52,719
it was one of the most wonderful

1072
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,960
experiences i had and i do things with

1073
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,279
great gusto whatever i do i want to take

1074
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,280
it all the way so to me that meant

1075
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,200
really learning about christianity in

1076
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,359
this case catholicism so i was baptized

1077
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:04,719
confirmed and i said i want to go all

1078
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:06,639
the way

1079
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:07,519
i became an altar boy in the catholic

1080
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,118
church

1081
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:11,759
you're going to be the best altar boy

1082
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:13,358
there ever was i had like serious skills

1083
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,359
you passed that collection basket i

1084
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,480
could push people and get them to 2x

1085
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,960
their contributions um but in this case

1086
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,440
uh i was 13. i don't know if you

1087
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,519
remember you know when you were 13. but

1088
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,960
if you extrapolate the next level up you

1089
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,039
know it's like you go graduate student

1090
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,358
postdoc professor the next level up from

1091
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,119
you know confirmation altar boy is

1092
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,119
priest and i don't know if you're aware

1093
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:37,760
of this but priests are not entitled to

1094
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,240
have relations with with women and as a

1095
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,000
13 year old boy kind of like future

1096
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:44,399
casting what life's going to be like for

1097
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,079
myself if i continue on my path

1098
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,160
um i found it maybe i the math net up

1099
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,720
that's right there was a there was a

1100
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:55,598
serious gap in uh in that future in that

1101
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:57,358
future um and instead when i should have

1102
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,039
been preparing for my bar mitzvah you

1103
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:00,639
know as most jewish boys would be a 12

1104
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:03,440
13 year old boy i actually got a

1105
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,559
telescope and uh and became infatuated

1106
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,920
with all the things you could see with

1107
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:07,519
it it wasn't bigger than that one over

1108
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,320
there that your hedgehog's looking

1109
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:13,039
through is that a hedgehog that says

1110
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:15,838
it's a hedgehog hedgehog and the fog

1111
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,039
i should mention and we'll go one by one

1112
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:18,799
these things you've given me some

1113
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:20,800
incredible gifts maybe this is a good

1114
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,720
place to ask about

1115
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,560
the telescope that put some clamps on

1116
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:26,239
and let the hedgehogs look

1117
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,838
and uh using now you're officially an

1118
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,919
experimental astrophysicist by the way

1119
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:31,679
why experimentalist versus an engineer

1120
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,039
because you assembled this telescope you

1121
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,960
gave it a mount

1122
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,400
and you connected it to uh to a very

1123
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,400
yeah but there's no experiment going on

1124
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,400
it's just engineering for show okay it's

1125
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,480
very shallow so experimenters taking it

1126
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,559
to the next level and actually achieving

1127
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,599
something here i just built a thing for

1128
00:37:44,559 --> 00:37:46,719
show well that's always a joke people

1129
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,400
say oh you're an experimental

1130
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,480
cosmologist i'm like yeah i build a lot

1131
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,000
of universes oh we actually most of my

1132
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,440
time is putting clamps on things

1133
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:55,519
soldering things you know it's not

1134
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,440
actually doing the stroking of my

1135
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:59,440
non-existent beard contemplating the

1136
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,519
cyclic versus the bouncing cosmological

1137
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,000
model yeah and just like uh most of

1138
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,838
robotics is just using velcro for things

1139
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,559
right yeah it's not like having dancing

1140
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:10,078
dogs and whatever right so telescope yes

1141
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:11,358
this telescope what's the what's the

1142
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,079
story of this little telescope this

1143
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:16,960
telescope's uh a very precious thing in

1144
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,359
some ways a symbol uh of what got me

1145
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,519
into you know what brought me all the

1146
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:24,880
blessings i have my life came from a

1147
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,880
telescope and i always advise parents or

1148
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,559
even people for themselves you right

1149
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,079
here wherever we are

1150
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:31,599
the biggest city on earth manhattan

1151
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,200
where i was growing up as a 12 year old

1152
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,960
outside of manhattan

1153
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:37,118
you can see the exact same craters on

1154
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,920
the moon the same rings of saturn the

1155
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:42,720
same moons of jupiter the same phases of

1156
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,720
v you can see the andromeda galaxy lacks

1157
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:46,480
two and a half million light years away

1158
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:47,919
from earth you can do that with that

1159
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,199
little thing over there one that's a

1160
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,440
little more expensive get one that has a

1161
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,879
mount and and you can attach now your

1162
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,838
smartphone what the hell is that i

1163
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,358
wouldn't have known what that was in

1164
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,279
1984.

1165
00:38:55,358 --> 00:38:59,598
and with that you can do something that

1166
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,000
no other science to my knowledge can

1167
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,559
really replicate maybe biology in some

1168
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,559
sense but you can experience

1169
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,358
the physical sensation

1170
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:11,279
that galileo experienced when he turned

1171
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,920
a telescope like that to jupiter and saw

1172
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,839
these four dots around it or that saturn

1173
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,000
had ears as he called it or that the

1174
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,400
moon was not crystalline polished smooth

1175
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:22,559
and and made of this heavenly substance

1176
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:24,400
the quintessent substance right

1177
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,400
so where else can you be

1178
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,838
viscerally connected with the first

1179
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,440
person ever make that discovery try

1180
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:31,119
doing that with the higgs boson you know

1181
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,559
get yourself an lhc

1182
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,640
and smash together you know high

1183
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:36,239
luminosity you know call a parry cliff

1184
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,319
and say you know i want to rep how did

1185
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,559
you feel he didn't feel anything none of

1186
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,720
them felt anything it took years to come

1187
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:44,639
you can't do it but with this you can

1188
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:46,959
feel the exact same emotions that's

1189
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,838
fascinating it's almost like maybe maybe

1190
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,400
there's uh another one like that is fire

1191
00:39:49,838 --> 00:39:54,320
yeah like when you build a bonfire like

1192
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,039
can you actually get it see if you use a

1193
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:58,640
lighter i think if you actually by

1194
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,719
rubbing sticks together however you do

1195
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:02,239
it without any of the modern tools

1196
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,838
that's probably what that's like yeah

1197
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:04,719
and then you get to experience the magic

1198
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,159
of it

1199
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:10,399
of what like early humans say feel what

1200
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,480
og felt when he did it that first time

1201
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,280
by the way is this a gift this is a gift

1202
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,559
of course

1203
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,640
is this you need a little bit of a swag

1204
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:19,920
upgrade so i got you i will yeah this is

1205
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:21,838
a i'm uh i'm pulling a putin mike asked

1206
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,240
if this is a gift making a very

1207
00:40:21,838 --> 00:40:26,239
uncomfortable feed feeds

1208
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:27,919
not really this is actually my childhood

1209
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,318
tell us come here you know

1210
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,400
but now i'm keeping it that's all right

1211
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:34,239
so looking through this telescope was

1212
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,079
when your love for science was first

1213
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:38,239
born changed my life because not only

1214
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:41,599
was i doing that i was replicating what

1215
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:43,279
galileo did but i was and yeah i'm 100

1216
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,039
not comparing myself to galileo galilei

1217
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,040
okay if there's any confusion out there

1218
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:48,639
but i did replicate exactly what he did

1219
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:50,800
and i was like holy crap this is weird

1220
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,639
let me write it down so it had another

1221
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,920
effect which all good scientists budding

1222
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:54,960
scientists should do and all parents

1223
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,880
should do

1224
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,280
get your kid a book a little notebook

1225
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:01,280
tape a pencil to it write down what you

1226
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,640
see what you hypothesize what you think

1227
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,599
it's going to be not like in the high

1228
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:08,078
school you know like hypothesis thesis

1229
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,480
but just like wow how did i feel better

1230
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,200
yet astronomy is a visual science sketch

1231
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,358
what you see the lagoon nebula the

1232
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:17,838
pleiades seven sisters you can see them

1233
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:19,598
anywhere on earth and when you do that

1234
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:21,119
again you're connecting two different

1235
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:23,359
hemispheres of your brain as i

1236
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:25,039
understand it and you're connecting them

1237
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,440
through your fingertips you literally

1238
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:30,000
have the knowledge in your fingertips in

1239
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:31,760
your connection between what you see

1240
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,639
what you observe and what you write down

1241
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,480
then

1242
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:35,759
you do research right

1243
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:37,358
the goal of science is not to just

1244
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,560
replicate what other people did is do

1245
00:41:37,358 --> 00:41:40,318
something new

1246
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:41,759
and that's why we call it research and

1247
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:45,039
not just like studying you know

1248
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,640
wikipedia and in so doing you start to

1249
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:50,318
train a kid at age 12 or 13 for 50 bucks

1250
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,679
it's unbelievable and now we can do even

1251
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:54,159
better because you got share it on

1252
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,559
instagram or whatever and you can by

1253
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:57,920
doing so have an entree into the world

1254
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,799
of what does it really mean to be a

1255
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,440
scientist and do so viscerally you know

1256
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:05,039
i often say i was taught this by my uh

1257
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,440
english teacher mrs tompkins in ninth

1258
00:42:05,039 --> 00:42:08,559
grade that the word educate it doesn't

1259
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:10,559
mean

1260
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,078
to pour into let me pour in some facts

1261
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,358
into lex and you know it's not like

1262
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,280
machine learning you're just showing

1263
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:16,799
like billions of cats or you know you're

1264
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,040
not like forcing it in you're bringing

1265
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,039
it out it means to pour out of in latin

1266
00:42:19,039 --> 00:42:23,039
educare and

1267
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,480
what more could a teacher want than to

1268
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,838
have something that the kid is just like

1269
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,318
gushing no you're not going to see like

1270
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:30,239
inspire the kid yes inspire yeah shout

1271
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,679
out to mrs tompkins yeah mrs thompkins

1272
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:35,358
she's watching yeah she's a big fan

1273
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:36,799
me she doesn't care but you yeah

1274
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:39,519
excellent

1275
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,119
would take those who love for granted uh

1276
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,280
this is in manhattan this is in

1277
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:45,119
westchester county new york yeah got it

1278
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,200
so okay so but then that's where the

1279
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,160
dream is born yeah

1280
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,559
but

1281
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:53,598
then there is the pragmatic journey of a

1282
00:42:50,559 --> 00:42:55,119
scientist so going to university

1283
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:57,440
graduate school

1284
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,318
post-doc and all the way to where you

1285
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,559
are today what's what's uh uh what's

1286
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,400
that what are some notable moments in

1287
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,078
that journey so i call that the academic

1288
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,160
hunger games you know because it's like

1289
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:10,480
you're competing against like these

1290
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,759
people you know who are just getting

1291
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,519
smarter all the time as you're getting

1292
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,760
smarter all the time they're they want

1293
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,599
to get into a fewer and fewer number of

1294
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,200
slots like there's fewer slots to get

1295
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,720
into college than not in high school

1296
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,639
there's fewer slots in graduate school

1297
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:25,039
there's sure very fewer slots to be a

1298
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:26,639
postdoc and many many maybe

1299
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,519
infinitesimal number you know we just

1300
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:31,598
did a faculty search at uc san diego 400

1301
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:33,838
applicants for one position it's almost

1302
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,680
getting impossible like i almost can't

1303
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:37,039
conceive of doing what these new

1304
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,960
brilliant young people applying to

1305
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,719
become a assistant professor at a state

1306
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:43,119
university that they're doing like it

1307
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:45,039
takes so much courage to do that um so i

1308
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,960
went from you know this kid in new york

1309
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,880
uh thinking i would never be a

1310
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,960
professional astronomer a because i

1311
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,720
didn't know any i'd never seen any i

1312
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,000
didn't even know that they existed and i

1313
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,838
thought who the hell's gonna pay me to

1314
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,838
look at the stars like won't they pay me

1315
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:59,279
to be like an ice cream taster like it's

1316
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:00,719
just not something i could conceive of

1317
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,079
getting paid to do even if i had the

1318
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:03,679
brilliance to do it which i didn't feel

1319
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:05,760
like did

1320
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,879
and then i went to graduate school

1321
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,440
and um and during graduate school i had

1322
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,200
this kind of um on-again off-again

1323
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:14,880
relationship with my father and i knew

1324
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:16,318
that he was a mathematician i he had

1325
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,599
left and gotten remarried himself and

1326
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:19,440
moved across the country i didn't see

1327
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,599
him for 15 years

1328
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,280
and in that time i learned a lot about

1329
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:25,039
him and i learned that he had gotten

1330
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,960
very interested not in pure mathematics

1331
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,599
which he had been a number theorist and

1332
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,760
contributed seminal work on the fantine

1333
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,480
equations which play a role in turing's

1334
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,480
work you may have seen but anyway he had

1335
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,838
become interested turned completely away

1336
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:39,440
from that into the foundations of

1337
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:40,719
quantum mechanics and relativity which

1338
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,079
is physics and by that time i was at

1339
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:43,759
brown university

1340
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:45,680
and i was you know thinking uh maybe

1341
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,280
i'll be condensed matter physicist or

1342
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:49,199
experimentalist i never thought i'd be a

1343
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,240
theorist and i'm not a theorist so it

1344
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:53,679
was pretty prescient and um but it

1345
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,000
always appealed to me like why not do

1346
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,078
what made me happy as a 12 year old like

1347
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,159
we often forget about like those you

1348
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:01,760
know primitive things about us are

1349
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,279
probably the most sustainable durable

1350
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,280
and resilient attributes of our

1351
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,400
character so with my own kids i look

1352
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,079
like what are they interested now when

1353
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,119
they're young and it doesn't mean that's

1354
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:10,640
what they're going to do i mean some of

1355
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,079
them want to play fortnite you know like

1356
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:12,879
professional fortnite play which there

1357
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,800
are

1358
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,160
but you know the odds of that is less

1359
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:17,359
than the odds of being a professor can i

1360
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,559
ask you

1361
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,358
is your father

1362
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:21,358
still with us no

1363
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:27,280
just in a small tangent yeah

1364
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,000
do you miss him do you think about him

1365
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,400
does his mathematical journey

1366
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,199
reverberate through who you are oh yeah

1367
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,200
absolutely i mean it it did in very many

1368
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:40,559
ways and he's been gone for a long time

1369
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:43,118
now thinking back to that time with him

1370
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:45,920
he must have instilled some capacity for

1371
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,280
me to only want to spend my time which

1372
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,559
is a limited quantity i don't think it's

1373
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,880
the most limited quantity maybe we'll

1374
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:51,838
talk about that later but um but to go

1375
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,000
into

1376
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,000
um only the most challenging interesting

1377
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,599
things with the limited time that we

1378
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,599
have while we're alive and for him it

1379
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,838
was the foundations of quantum mechanics

1380
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:03,838
for me it was the foundations of the

1381
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:05,599
universe and how did it come to be and i

1382
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:07,440
felt like well people been trying since

1383
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:09,599
einstein to outdo einstein really have

1384
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,760
made great progress in the foundations

1385
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,680
of quantum mechanics but this is an

1386
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,520
exciting time the kobe satellite had

1387
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:17,759
just released its data that the universe

1388
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:19,119
had this anisotropy pattern stephen

1389
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,440
hawking called it like looking at the

1390
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:22,960
face of god and so forth

1391
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,880
and so it seemed like this is a good

1392
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,880
golden age for what i'm gonna do and

1393
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,119
what i'm most interested in but always

1394
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,559
throughout that i wanted to understand i

1395
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:32,318
didn't want to be a wrench monkey no

1396
00:46:30,559 --> 00:46:34,239
offense to people that just do

1397
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:35,838
experiment and no offense to monkeys no

1398
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,318
offense to monkeys that's right this

1399
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:41,119
little guy sorry man um but thinking

1400
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:43,279
back to what animates me it's not doing

1401
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,960
the engineering as much as it is

1402
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,720
getting the data but there's a lot of

1403
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,920
steps i want to be the guy

1404
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:52,318
um understanding what made the universe

1405
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:53,920
produce the signal that we saw so i

1406
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:56,000
always joke with my theorist friends you

1407
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,599
know call me a closeted theorist you

1408
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,199
know like i want to be you know what

1409
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:00,400
they call a guy who hangs out with

1410
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:02,879
musicians

1411
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,559
a drummer so i want to be like like that

1412
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,760
for physics right like for theoretical

1413
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:07,679
physics i want to be like the guy

1414
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,880
doesn't do new theory but understands

1415
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,358
the theory that the new theorists are

1416
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,480
doing i love that formulation of a

1417
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:14,880
theorist

1418
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:17,199
is understanding

1419
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,000
the source of the signal you're getting

1420
00:47:17,199 --> 00:47:21,519
like signal is primary like the the

1421
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,719
thing you measure

1422
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:28,239
is primary and theory is just

1423
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:30,799
the search of explaining um

1424
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:32,959
how that signal originated but it's all

1425
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:35,200
about the signal i mean i i see the same

1426
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,599
search for the human mind and like

1427
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:40,000
neuroscience in that same kind of way

1428
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:42,480
is it's ultimately about the signal but

1429
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
you kind of hope to understand

1430
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,480
how that signal originated that's

1431
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,039
fascinating that's uh that's such a

1432
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,800
beautiful way to

1433
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:54,400
to explain experimental physics

1434
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,920
because it it ultimately at the end of

1435
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,400
the day is

1436
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,240
all about the signal yeah

1437
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,639
yeah and maybe those two things the the

1438
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,719
neuroscience and like cosmos uh not

1439
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:07,199
getting too romantic but yeah maybe

1440
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:08,959
they're linked in some fundamental way

1441
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:11,199
some fundamental conscious cosmic

1442
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,639
consciousness but um we're gonna get to

1443
00:48:11,199 --> 00:48:14,318
that yeah yeah no we definitely have to

1444
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,000
do that

1445
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,440
but getting back to yet so it's so my

1446
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,199
origins so i always say like and i want

1447
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,318
to try this on you you said you wouldn't

1448
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,439
answer any of my questions but i'm going

1449
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:23,039
to ask you some questions what's the

1450
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,720
most important day on the calendar don't

1451
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:26,239
tell me the date but what to you what is

1452
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,039
your mo what's the most important day to

1453
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:28,799
you

1454
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:30,639
every year do i have to answer or do i

1455
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,920
have to think about it no no answer like

1456
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:33,679
you don't tell me the exact date of the

1457
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,358
count it could be like your mistresses

1458
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,078
you know a birthday or whatever but i

1459
00:48:35,358 --> 00:48:39,358
have so many i lose track

1460
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:42,079
even though i'm single how does that

1461
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,920
even make sense i know okay i'm sorry uh

1462
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,079
so i uh a day

1463
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,440
like like uh like a month and a day yeah

1464
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:50,800
i mean for me it would be december 31st

1465
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:52,880
yeah so i was going to say new year's

1466
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,960
eve new year's day uh some people say

1467
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:57,440
birthday anniversary kids birth they're

1468
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,679
usually signif signifying beginnings and

1469
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,440
ends right january means the portal

1470
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:03,199
between the god was the portal between

1471
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,240
the beginning and the end so you're

1472
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:06,558
looking back maybe because you're

1473
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:07,919
russian like the death side the light

1474
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,160
side looking forward to january the

1475
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,680
beginning right

1476
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,920
so um

1477
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:16,239
everybody's most important day

1478
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,079
is usually some beginning or something

1479
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:19,358
significant for me it was studying the

1480
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,960
most significant thing of all it's like

1481
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:24,480
when did the universe get born as i said

1482
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:26,240
before and i didn't think there again i

1483
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,639
didn't i just there was some mental

1484
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:30,959
obstruction that i didn't realize

1485
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:33,199
that i could get past because i didn't

1486
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,880
think like anybody does it like i knew

1487
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:36,960
astronomers knew these answers like the

1488
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:39,318
universe at that time between 10 and 20

1489
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,240
billion years old now we know it's

1490
00:49:39,318 --> 00:49:44,239
13.872 billion years old it's incredible

1491
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,199
the five digits you know for significant

1492
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:48,919
five what is it again 13.

1493
00:49:46,199 --> 00:49:52,078
13.872 billion years

1494
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,519
872 million so is there a lot of plus or

1495
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,920
minus on that is that what are the

1496
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:57,280
errors for me i'm 50. so it would be the

1497
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,358
equivalent of you looking at me and

1498
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,680
telling me within 12 hours how old i am

1499
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,440
yeah it's a half a percent percent level

1500
00:50:01,679 --> 00:50:04,639
accuracy there's the confidence behind

1501
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,559
that oh yeah i mean there's the

1502
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:07,598
significance yeah no it's extremely well

1503
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,920
measured i mean it's one of the most

1504
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,960
precise things that we have in contrast

1505
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:14,800
to again 25 years ago we didn't know if

1506
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:16,800
the universe was 10 billion or 20

1507
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:18,720
billion years old but there were stars

1508
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,960
in our galaxy that were believed to be

1509
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,558
as they are about 12 billion years old

1510
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,960
or in the universe that were 12 billion

1511
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,559
so that would be like you being um older

1512
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,079
than your father

1513
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:30,240
it was embarrassing can we can we

1514
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,760
actually take a tangent on the tangent

1515
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,078
tension out of tangent

1516
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,359
how old is the universe can you can you

1517
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:39,280
dig in onto this number how do we know

1518
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,358
currently with those i guess you said

1519
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:43,519
five four or five uh

1520
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:45,598
significant uh digits so we can come

1521
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,199
about it from two different ways one uh

1522
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,720
basically they rely on the most

1523
00:50:47,199 --> 00:50:50,480
important number in cosmology which is

1524
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:53,118
called the hubble constant the hubble

1525
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,039
constant is this weird number that has

1526
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,318
the following units it has the units of

1527
00:50:55,039 --> 00:51:00,558
kilometers per second per megaparsec so

1528
00:50:58,318 --> 00:51:01,920
it's a speed per distance which means

1529
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,440
you multiply it by distance and you get

1530
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,800
a speed and what is the speed you're

1531
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,480
measuring well you're measuring the

1532
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,720
speed of a distant galaxy at many

1533
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,159
megaparsecs away so a galaxy at one

1534
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:11,358
megaparsec away this isn't actually

1535
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,440
strictly true because of local

1536
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,598
gravitational effects uh but if you go

1537
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,679
out say one uh megaparsico i would say

1538
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,680
that that galaxy is moving 72 kilometers

1539
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:22,078
per second away from you and every

1540
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,838
galaxy except for the local very most

1541
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,200
local group surrounding us maybe a half

1542
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:28,880
a dozen galaxies out of 50 to sorry

1543
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,199
sorry out of uh

1544
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,920
500 billion galaxies to perhaps a

1545
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,799
trillion galaxies so 12 out of that

1546
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,079
number

1547
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,519
are moving towards us the rest are

1548
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,240
moving away from us

1549
00:51:37,519 --> 00:51:40,480
so

1550
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:42,239
that number if you invert it

1551
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:44,159
if you say well when did those things

1552
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:46,078
last touch each other all those galaxies

1553
00:51:44,159 --> 00:51:47,358
now they're really far apart we know how

1554
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,039
fast they're moving away it's a very

1555
00:51:47,358 --> 00:51:50,719
simple algebra problem to solve when

1556
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:53,199
were they touching that's where you get

1557
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:55,279
that number from so there's the local 12

1558
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,799
and then the rest ignore the 12 yeah and

1559
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,480
then ignore the 12 and then look at the

1560
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,640
others and yeah the then solve the

1561
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,400
algebra problem

1562
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,000
uh how does the

1563
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,920
and stuff in the beginning though the

1564
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,480
mystery of that beginning epic changed

1565
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:11,280
this calculation of very little because

1566
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,719
actually we understand um how there's

1567
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,319
some other ingredients that go into it

1568
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:15,679
namely how much dark energy there is in

1569
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:17,599
the universe how much dark matter there

1570
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:20,159
is in the universe how much radiation

1571
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,838
light neutrinos etcetera are and how

1572
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,480
much ordinary matter like we're made up

1573
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:26,960
of neutrons protons croutons

1574
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,960
okay so

1575
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,720
morons

1576
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:37,279
it appears that the universe

1577
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:39,519
is bigger than it is older

1578
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,559
how does that make sense oh oh yeah so

1579
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:42,880
you're talking about the fact that we

1580
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:45,599
can actually see stuff in our observable

1581
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,240
universe that's located at a distance

1582
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:50,079
that is farther than the speed of light

1583
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:51,838
times the age of the universe naively

1584
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,160
you would say that the the yeah so

1585
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,078
you're right if the universe were static

1586
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:57,358
um if the universe came into existence

1587
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,839
and you can conceive of this the

1588
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:01,519
universe came into a big bang in a fixed

1589
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:04,239
universe so the universe just

1590
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,920
started off those galaxies were you know

1591
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:08,719
they could be moving towards us away

1592
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:10,800
from us who knows um that you could say

1593
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:11,879
i can see a galaxy that's at a distance

1594
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,240
of only

1595
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,240
13.8 billion years times the speed of

1596
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:18,639
light that would be true but the fact

1597
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:20,799
that the light is expanding along with

1598
00:53:18,639 --> 00:53:23,199
the expansion of the universe so imagine

1599
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,039
there was some very distant past but we

1600
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,039
were near a galaxy it's going to produce

1601
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:28,558
some light and that galaxy is going to

1602
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,239
be moving away from us the light's going

1603
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,839
to be getting more and more red shifted

1604
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:33,838
as it's called it's going to be moving

1605
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:35,039
farther and farther away from us

1606
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:36,719
as time goes on there'll be some

1607
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,639
acceleration as we get into the era of

1608
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,799
dark energy

1609
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:42,799
the light signals there'll be some cone

1610
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:44,480
of acceptance if you will

1611
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,400
from which which represents all the

1612
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:48,318
events that we could have received

1613
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,599
information from we can't currently

1614
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:53,119
communicate with that galaxy it

1615
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,480
sent us some light and now it's moving

1616
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:56,480
away and it sent this some light and

1617
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,318
because the space is also dragging the

1618
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,400
photons with it if you like the photons

1619
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,440
are being participating in the expansion

1620
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,760
of the universe that's why they're

1621
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:05,838
redshifting that we can see things to

1622
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,000
out to where the universe first began

1623
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:09,920
expanding not just when it began

1624
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:12,159
existing and because the universe has

1625
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,079
been expanding for 13.8 billion years

1626
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:16,558
with no sign of slowing down yet which

1627
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:18,000
is a huge uh surprise serendipitous

1628
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,599
surprise

1629
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:21,280
that we can see things approximately

1630
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,960
three times the age of the universe away

1631
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,800
from us so we can see if it's called the

1632
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,400
age of the universe 15 billion years

1633
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,559
just to make the math simple we see

1634
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,280
things at 45 billion light years

1635
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:33,119
distance in that direction and we see

1636
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,280
things at 45 billion light years in that

1637
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,760
direction just turning our telescopes

1638
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:40,400
180 degrees away so that means we see

1639
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,319
things that themselves are are 90

1640
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:43,760
billion light years away from each other

1641
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,759
that's sort of the diameter of the

1642
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,839
observable universe is there another

1643
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,680
universe beyond that we don't know some

1644
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:51,759
conjecture there's not only one there's

1645
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:54,558
an infinite number of them how are you

1646
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,799
emotionally okay with the fact that our

1647
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,040
universe is expanding so like it's gonna

1648
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:01,280
be like annie hall like with alvi uh

1649
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:02,400
singer uh i'll grow up in the soviet

1650
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,240
union

1651
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:06,318
we watched propaganda i realized that

1652
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:10,000
you did yes uh so there's a family paul

1653
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:10,000
is that some kind of what is this

1654
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,960
movie with woody allen um certainly

1655
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:17,519
cancelled but yeah but nevertheless back

1656
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,039
when he was uh uh not cancelled yet uh

1657
00:55:17,519 --> 00:55:20,960
he made a movie called annie hall in

1658
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,880
which as a self-depiction he's like a

1659
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,440
larry david before larry david was larry

1660
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:27,838
david neurotic typical neurotic young

1661
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,039
jew he's in brooklyn and he all of a

1662
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:30,719
sudden tells his mother he's not doing

1663
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,400
his homework anymore he refuses to do

1664
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,399
his homework his mother says why it goes

1665
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,480
because the universe is expanding and it

1666
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,079
keeps on expanding uh everything will

1667
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,599
rip apart and no we'll never have

1668
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,359
anything in contact and everything is

1669
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,680
meaningless i assume these are some of

1670
00:55:41,358 --> 00:55:45,440
the topics we're going to get to

1671
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:47,598
and she goes what are you talking about

1672
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,079
we're in brooklyn brooklyn is not

1673
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,680
expanding uh and that's true brooklyn is

1674
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,720
not expanding the solar system is not

1675
00:55:51,679 --> 00:55:53,759
expanding

1676
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:55,838
oftentimes they get asked what is the

1677
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,200
universe expanding into that's one of my

1678
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:59,920
favorite questions

1679
00:55:57,199 --> 00:56:01,118
what is it expanding into and i say it's

1680
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,920
actually an easy question if you think

1681
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:05,760
about it um you've seen your friend ilan

1682
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:08,159
he goes on space he's got a rocket right

1683
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,440
what's outside of the rocket if you take

1684
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:11,759
if you take this bottle empty out this

1685
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,119
bottle take the cap off it go outside

1686
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:14,880
the rocket you know

1687
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:18,079
sip in some tang

1688
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,318
screw on the cover of it what's in there

1689
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:24,160
is it empty

1690
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:26,400
uh that's just semantics i guess uh

1691
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:28,239
yeah no it's definitely not empty so you

1692
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,838
step outside the rocket yeah you're in

1693
00:56:28,239 --> 00:56:31,439
the vacuum of space the quote-unquote

1694
00:56:29,838 --> 00:56:32,719
vacuum ups and there's no more liquid in

1695
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,079
it there's no more liquid in it no it's

1696
00:56:32,719 --> 00:56:35,919
just just a container one cubic

1697
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:38,480
centimeter let's just make it simple one

1698
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,639
cubic centimeter of a box and you take

1699
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,920
it out into space outside of the falcon

1700
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,960
whatever right

1701
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,079
um what's inside that box it's not empty

1702
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,920
there's actually

1703
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,559
i'm gonna say this is gonna set your

1704
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:52,639
friends up there's 420

1705
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,839
photons from the fusion of the light

1706
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:55,838
elements that we call the cosmic

1707
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:58,000
microwave background inside that box at

1708
00:56:55,838 --> 00:57:00,000
any second okay all right hold on a

1709
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,400
second what

1710
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,639
420 that's uh i've heard of that number

1711
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,639
before all right let's it used to be 69

1712
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:09,199
but then they changed

1713
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:11,679
wow physics works in mysterious ways and

1714
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:14,078
the millimeter box is 69. what what are

1715
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:16,399
we talking about here what uh what's

1716
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,240
inside what's what's in the box i'm

1717
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,680
gonna get it that's right let's think

1718
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:21,759
outside the box no we're thinking inside

1719
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:24,000
the way so if you have every cubic

1720
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:25,839
centimeter of our observable universe is

1721
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,119
suffused with heat left over from the

1722
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:28,880
big bang

1723
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,760
dark matter particles there's a little

1724
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,200
ordinary matter in the universe

1725
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,040
and every cubic centimeter there's some

1726
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:38,318
probability to find a proton a cosmic

1727
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:40,000
ray an electron etc there's actually an

1728
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:41,920
awful lot of neutrinos inside of that

1729
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,280
cubic centimeter now just imagine how

1730
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,720
many cubic centimeters there are in the

1731
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:46,640
universe it's enormous that's why

1732
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:48,798
there's enormous numbers of particles in

1733
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:51,519
our universe it's a very rich universe

1734
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:53,280
but now let's zoom in on that box so now

1735
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:55,440
inside that box there might be you know

1736
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,040
one let's let's say there might be one

1737
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,960
ordinary matter like a proton or an

1738
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,759
electron a baryon

1739
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:03,358
a lepton there might be a couple some a

1740
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:05,280
couple hundred neutrinos and there'll be

1741
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:06,880
a couple hundred photons as i said four

1742
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,599
hundred and twenty

1743
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,838
what's between those guys

1744
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,559
what's between the protons and the

1745
00:58:11,838 --> 00:58:17,920
neutrinos and the photons like just zoom

1746
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,440
into a cubic micron now like imagine 420

1747
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,039
things inside a box this big it's

1748
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,798
actually pretty empty like they're

1749
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,400
zipping around in there right so between

1750
00:58:22,798 --> 00:58:26,559
them there's a lot of empty space and

1751
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,639
this is outside the kind of

1752
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:30,240
physics-based models of fields and all

1753
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:32,558
those kinds of things just like just

1754
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:33,838
actually asking the question of like

1755
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,079
what is this

1756
00:58:33,838 --> 00:58:38,400
particle content in the universe in

1757
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,798
every cubic centimeter of the universe

1758
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,880
outside of the 420 so you have the 420

1759
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:44,719
420 they have they have some you know

1760
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,880
they have some mass well they have

1761
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,919
energy they don't matter photons

1762
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,920
energy that's why they don't bring

1763
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:51,920
suitcases you know that's true right

1764
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,880
photons never bring suitcases with you

1765
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,039
with them

1766
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,880
because they're traveling light

1767
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:58,798
see i don't even get a lesson

1768
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,079
that's corny dad jokes okay you'll

1769
00:58:58,798 --> 00:59:02,000
appreciate something

1770
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:04,160
pretty good it's just i'm laughing on

1771
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,400
the inside what's in the box what's the

1772
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:08,480
420 what's between

1773
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,559
the photons that's what space is that's

1774
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,079
what the universe is expanding into okay

1775
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,480
that's not so that's

1776
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,079
that's the notebook yeah on which the

1777
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,519
photons are written

1778
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:21,280
that's beautiful but still thank you uh

1779
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,519
still

1780
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:26,079
i i i understand this but it's still

1781
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,639
uncomfortable that that if the uh the

1782
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:31,359
universe is expanding that this thing is

1783
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:33,039
expanding the the canvas is expanding

1784
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:34,480
it's very strange

1785
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,318
because like if we're just sitting there

1786
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:39,039
still i guess if we're in brooklyn

1787
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:40,639
nothing's expanding so our

1788
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:42,239
cognition our

1789
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:43,519
intuition about the world is based on

1790
00:59:42,239 --> 00:59:44,639
this local

1791
00:59:43,519 --> 00:59:47,679
fact that

1792
00:59:44,639 --> 00:59:49,519
we don't get to experience um

1793
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:52,239
this kind of expansion

1794
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:54,239
yeah and that intuition leads us astray

1795
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:56,719
but you know that gravity is the weakest

1796
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:59,039
of the so-called four fundamental forces

1797
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:01,118
um and yet it has the longest range

1798
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:02,400
pervasiveness gravity is you know we're

1799
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:05,200
being pulled towards the andromeda

1800
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,798
galaxy at some enormous rate of speed

1801
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:08,159
because of its massive counter

1802
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:11,280
gravitational force to the force we

1803
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:13,598
exert on it uh so gravity is enormously

1804
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,640
long range but incredibly weak

1805
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:19,200
and because of that uh we can think

1806
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:21,759
about these effects of expansion as the

1807
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:24,000
relationship between the

1808
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,440
as you said the no the grid lines on the

1809
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,639
notebook right

1810
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:31,119
gravity is a manifestation of the

1811
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:33,118
interrelationship between those points

1812
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,280
how far they are from each other and

1813
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:37,760
those can change those point distances

1814
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,640
can change over time because of the

1815
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,960
force of gravity so it's weak and

1816
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:44,159
what we experience is gravity

1817
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,559
is the

1818
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,879
um changing of those trajectories from

1819
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:51,200
being rectilinear to curvilinear that's

1820
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,640
what we experience is gravity well you

1821
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:54,318
have this analogy when you talk to barry

1822
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:56,960
barish about bowling ball and a

1823
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:58,000
trampoline and uh that's almost right uh

1824
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,000
because it's actually you have to

1825
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,679
visualize that now in four dimensions

1826
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,920
like wrapping a trampoline at every

1827
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:05,598
point around the object including on the

1828
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,920
sides and it becomes very hard to

1829
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,760
visualize so a lot of people use that um

1830
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,240
it's also fraught analogy because you're

1831
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,160
using gravity like the notion of gravity

1832
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:15,919
pulling something down to explain the

1833
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:18,159
notion of gravity so it's a little

1834
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,920
overburdening the analogy

1835
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:22,480
but okay so you mentioned barry bearish

1836
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,240
wrote the forward to your book yeah

1837
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,318
how do gravitational waves fit into all

1838
01:01:24,239 --> 01:01:27,679
this how how do they on the emotional

1839
01:01:26,318 --> 01:01:30,880
level how do they make you feel that

1840
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:33,118
they're just uh moving space time

1841
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,960
yeah so gravitational waves were the

1842
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,640
nobel prize for gravitational waves

1843
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,039
discovery the first time you know it's

1844
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:42,558
this this was discovered twice

1845
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:44,558
indirectly by two uh men uh uh named

1846
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,559
halsen taylor and that was given my

1847
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,240
first year of graduate school the ia i

1848
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,000
entered graduate school almost they they

1849
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:51,519
announced these two guys one and the guy

1850
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,119
who won it did the work that would later

1851
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:55,599
win him the nobel prize when he was my

1852
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:58,960
age is this in the 40s uh this was no

1853
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:00,160
this is the 19th that was a joke

1854
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:02,880
i got it i got it you know to a

1855
01:02:00,159 --> 01:02:05,598
cosmologist age it means nothing um and

1856
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,119
to a tennis player not on tinder

1857
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:09,359
that's right all right

1858
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:12,000
sorry gravitational waves do fit in uh

1859
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:14,480
because what we're trying to do now

1860
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,559
is use the properties of gravitational

1861
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,880
waves the analogous properties that they

1862
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:20,559
have to photons that they travel at the

1863
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,760
speed of light that they go through

1864
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,440
everything they can go through

1865
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:26,799
everything and that they're directly

1866
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,400
detectable we're using them to try to

1867
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:31,838
confirm

1868
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:34,639
if or if not inflation occurred

1869
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:36,239
so did inflation the spark that ignited

1870
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:37,679
the fusion of the elements in the early

1871
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:39,358
part of the universe and the expansion

1872
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:41,919
the initial expansion of the universe

1873
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:43,598
did that take place there's only one way

1874
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:46,240
that cosmologists believe we could ever

1875
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,880
see that through the imprint of these

1876
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:50,879
primordial gravitational waves not these

1877
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:52,400
old you know newcomers that barry

1878
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:54,880
studies the ones that occurred a billion

1879
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,960
light years uh away from us

1880
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:59,119
uh a billion years ago but we're seeing

1881
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,838
things that happened 13.82 billion years

1882
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:03,039
ago during the inflationary

1883
01:03:00,838 --> 01:03:06,480
epoch however

1884
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:07,760
those we cannot build a ligo and put it

1885
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,599
at the big bang

1886
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:11,760
so if you want to measure let's say you

1887
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,798
have a the old-time

1888
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,640
firecracker let's say there's a

1889
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:16,159
firecracker and you want to see if it

1890
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,558
went off in the building next door to

1891
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:20,960
you you can't see it so you can't see

1892
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:22,960
the imprint of it but you can hear it

1893
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,720
and what we're trying to do is hear the

1894
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:28,240
effect of gravitational waves from the

1895
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:30,558
big bang not by using a camera or even

1896
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:34,558
an interferometer like barry used and

1897
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:36,798
his colleagues but instead using the cmb

1898
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,640
the light the primordial ancient fossils

1899
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:41,038
of the universe the oldest light in the

1900
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,879
universe we're going to use that as a

1901
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,720
film quote unquote

1902
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:45,920
onto which gravitational waves get

1903
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:47,759
exposed

1904
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:49,599
and hope you can uh so what are the

1905
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,799
challenges there to get enough accuracy

1906
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:55,200
to to for the exposure so the the signal

1907
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:56,798
as i said it's um so there's 420 of

1908
01:03:55,199 --> 01:03:58,318
these photons per cubic centimeter and

1909
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,400
there's a lot of cubic centimeters in

1910
01:03:58,318 --> 01:04:03,358
the universe however what we're looking

1911
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:05,519
for is not the brightness of the photon

1912
01:04:03,358 --> 01:04:07,519
how intense it is we're not looking for

1913
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:10,079
its color what wavelength it is we're

1914
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:11,920
looking for what its polarization is

1915
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,760
and we'll go let me just ask are you

1916
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,000
serious about the per cubic millimeter

1917
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:19,280
of 420 is the number centimeter

1918
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,079
but uh uh cubic centimeter 420 is the

1919
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,000
number

1920
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:25,280
uh i wonder if elon knows this and if he

1921
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,280
doesn't he will truly enjoy this

1922
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,519
yeah that's true oh okay funding

1923
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:33,118
security excellent

1924
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:35,679
um so i mean this takes us to this story

1925
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,519
of heartbreak of triumph

1926
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:40,239
of uh that you described and losing the

1927
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:42,159
nobel prize so describe what uh

1928
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:44,318
polarization is that you mentioned yeah

1929
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:45,920
you can describe what bicep one and

1930
01:04:44,318 --> 01:04:47,440
bicep two are

1931
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,519
bicep three

1932
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,440
perhaps the instruments that uh can

1933
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:53,038
detect this kind of polarization what

1934
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:54,880
are the challenges

1935
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,200
the the origin story the whole thing

1936
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:59,358
yeah so well the origin story goes back

1937
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:01,199
again to like a father-son rivalry it

1938
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:02,880
really does my father won all these

1939
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:05,279
prizes awards etc but he never won a

1940
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:07,519
nobel prize and you know some parents in

1941
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,200
america they compete with their kids you

1942
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:10,639
know oh i was a football player in high

1943
01:05:09,199 --> 01:05:12,159
school i'll show you and whatever

1944
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:14,558
wrestling whatever and some of us could

1945
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:16,639
be healthy too um but

1946
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:19,359
um with me and my dad it wasn't super

1947
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,719
healthy like we would compete and and

1948
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:22,480
you know he was much more of a pure

1949
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:24,959
mathematician and i was an experimental

1950
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:27,679
physicist so we had both different ideas

1951
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,798
and what was worth prioritizing our time

1952
01:05:27,679 --> 01:05:31,118
but i knew for sure he didn't win the

1953
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:33,838
nobel prize and i knew i could kind of

1954
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:35,920
out do him so i feel pretty venal and

1955
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:37,199
kind of you know minuscule kind of

1956
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,798
character wise

1957
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,558
the only reason you could outdo him is

1958
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:42,798
because the fields medal is given every

1959
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:44,798
four years and only if you're under 40

1960
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:47,440
which he wasn't so he's working under

1961
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:49,679
much more limited conditions

1962
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:51,119
that's right so even if i had which you

1963
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,038
know spoiler alert the book's called

1964
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,039
losing the nobel prize so i didn't do it

1965
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,599
um but i wanted to do something big and

1966
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:00,160
i wanted to do something uh that would

1967
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:02,160
really just unequivocally be realized as

1968
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:03,679
in a discovery for the ages as in fact

1969
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,679
it was when we made the premature

1970
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:07,838
announcement that we had been successful

1971
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:10,480
so you were from the beginning

1972
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:12,480
reaching for the big questions that's

1973
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,159
all i can so as an experimenter you were

1974
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:17,199
swinging for the fences

1975
01:06:14,159 --> 01:06:19,440
that's all i wanted to do i felt like uh

1976
01:06:17,199 --> 01:06:21,598
if it's not you know if it's if it's

1977
01:06:19,440 --> 01:06:24,159
worth spending you know perhaps the rest

1978
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,599
of my life on as assigned as a scientist

1979
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:27,519
it better be damn well better be

1980
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:29,039
interesting to me to carry me through to

1981
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,119
give me the you know the you know i

1982
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:33,200
always say passion is great when people

1983
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:34,880
say oh follow your passion but it's not

1984
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:36,558
enough passion is like the spark that

1985
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,599
ignites the rocket but that's not enough

1986
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:41,680
to get the rocket into space so then

1987
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,160
you swung for the fences with bicep one

1988
01:06:41,679 --> 01:06:46,399
what is this so bicep one was born out

1989
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:49,038
of um kind of interesting circumstances

1990
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:51,039
so i had gone to a stanford university

1991
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:54,480
for a postdoc so an academic hunger

1992
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:56,559
games stand for stanford university yeah

1993
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,400
it's this uh small little school it's

1994
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:59,599
it's not like that technical college in

1995
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,680
massachusetts that you're affiliated

1996
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:05,599
with um but um as i went there i was

1997
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,919
working for a new assistant professor

1998
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,760
she had gotten there uh only a year

1999
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,280
before i got there and she had her own

2000
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:14,319
priorities the things that she wanted to

2001
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,599
do but i kept thinking in my spare time

2002
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:16,880
that i wanted to do something completely

2003
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,559
different she was saying galaxies at

2004
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,318
high red shift and i wanted to study the

2005
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:22,079
origin of the universe using this this

2006
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:24,239
type of technology

2007
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,079
and uh i realized courtesy of a good

2008
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:28,558
friend of mine who's now at johns

2009
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,480
hopkins mark kaminkowski that we didn't

2010
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:32,319
need this enormous hubble telescope we

2011
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:34,159
didn't need a 30 meter diameter

2012
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:36,558
telescope we needed a tiny refracting

2013
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:38,639
telescope no bigger than my head you

2014
01:07:36,559 --> 01:07:40,160
know less than a foot across and that

2015
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,239
telescope would have the same power as a

2016
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:43,838
hubble telescope you know size telescope

2017
01:07:42,239 --> 01:07:45,439
could have because the signals that

2018
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:47,440
we're looking for are enormous in

2019
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:50,639
wavelength on the sky they're enormously

2020
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:52,480
long large area signals on the sky and

2021
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:54,078
if we could measure that it would be

2022
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,679
proof effectively as close as you get to

2023
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:57,119
proof there could be things that mimic

2024
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:58,798
it but that we discovered the

2025
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,880
inflationary epoch

2026
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:03,599
inflation being the signal originally

2027
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,880
conceived by alan guth to explain why

2028
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:06,318
the universe had the large-scale

2029
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,680
features that it does

2030
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:10,480
namely that it has so-called flat

2031
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:13,199
geometry so there's no there's no way to

2032
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:15,599
make a triangle in space in our universe

2033
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:18,000
that has three interior angles that do

2034
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:19,679
not sum to 180 degrees

2035
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,198
you can do that with spacecraft you can

2036
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:22,319
do that with stars you can do that laser

2037
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:24,479
beams you can do that with three

2038
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,640
different galaxies all those galaxies no

2039
01:08:24,479 --> 01:08:29,039
matter how far you go have this geometry

2040
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:31,759
it's remarkable but it's also unstable

2041
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:33,439
it's very unlikely it's very seemingly

2042
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:35,520
finely tuned and that was one of the

2043
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:37,759
motivations that guth had to kind of

2044
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:40,000
conceive of this new idea called

2045
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:42,238
inflation 1979 when he was a postdoc

2046
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,920
also at stanford slack

2047
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:45,439
and uh he was trying to get a permanent

2048
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:47,838
job i was trying to like make my name

2049
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,759
for myself and uh so i realized i could

2050
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:52,079
do this but i was also being paid by

2051
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:54,719
this this professor at stanford to do a

2052
01:08:52,079 --> 01:08:56,640
job for her and i was kind of a crappy

2053
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:58,000
employee to be honest with you

2054
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,279
and then one day she couldn't take it

2055
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,119
anymore because i was like sketching

2056
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:03,520
notebooks and planning his experiments

2057
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:04,838
and i just i wasn't no i had big ideas

2058
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:07,920
in your mind you were planning big

2059
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:10,399
experiments and that was uh difficult to

2060
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,480
work with on a small scale for like a

2061
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:15,599
postdoc type of situation yeah we have

2062
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:17,678
to you know publish basic papers deliver

2063
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,798
on some basic deadlines for a project

2064
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:20,960
all those kinds of things support your

2065
01:09:18,798 --> 01:09:24,079
advisors paying actually

2066
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:26,480
and so one day i came in and um and it

2067
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:28,559
actually uh uh involved another friend

2068
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:30,479
of mine an astronomer named jill tarter

2069
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,159
one of the pioneers in the seti um

2070
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,479
science uh business of detecting

2071
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:36,079
extraterrestrials which i assume you'd

2072
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:38,079
never like to talk about aliens so i'm

2073
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:39,920
sure we won't get into aliens uh but

2074
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:40,880
jill was visiting stanford and i was

2075
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:42,560
like i really want to meet her can you

2076
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:45,119
introduce me and she said no in fact

2077
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,640
you're fired my my boss

2078
01:09:45,119 --> 01:09:48,880
so i was like

2079
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:50,400
is this is possibly the best thing that

2080
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:51,920
could ever happen to me i didn't know

2081
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:54,319
where it would lead or what would happen

2082
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,239
to it but getting fired from this ultra

2083
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:57,920
prestigious university

2084
01:09:56,238 --> 01:10:00,079
turned out to be the path i mean

2085
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,359
literally that brings me here today

2086
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:03,679
in that

2087
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:06,719
because of that i ended up working for

2088
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:07,840
another person in caltech which is in

2089
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:10,158
pasadena

2090
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:12,000
and um and she my original boss sarah

2091
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:13,679
church she got me the job with her

2092
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,800
former advisor a man by the name andrew

2093
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:17,279
lang

2094
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,480
and andrew was like he was like this i

2095
01:10:17,279 --> 01:10:19,519
don't know like

2096
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:22,000
um

2097
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:25,760
it's like any steve jobs or elon you

2098
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:28,158
know charismatic handsome uh persuasive

2099
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:30,800
idea man not the guy always in the lab

2100
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:33,119
you know doing everything but understood

2101
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,719
the where things are going decades from

2102
01:10:33,119 --> 01:10:36,079
now and he had been involved in

2103
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:37,760
experiment that actually measured the

2104
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:40,000
universe was flat

2105
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:41,600
very close to flat um along with a

2106
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,439
preceding experiment done at princeton

2107
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:45,280
by lyman page and other collaborators so

2108
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:47,678
the shape of the universe is flat the

2109
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:49,920
geometry of the universe is flat

2110
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:52,560
how did he do that experiment so he used

2111
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,920
the cosmic microwave background and so

2112
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:55,600
what i said is you have to look for

2113
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,440
triangles in the universe so you can

2114
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,199
measure triangles on earth you can

2115
01:10:57,439 --> 01:11:00,319
actually it's hard to show that the

2116
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:01,919
earth is curved but you can show the

2117
01:11:00,319 --> 01:11:03,519
earth is curved using triangles

2118
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:07,440
mountaintops etc if you have an accurate

2119
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:09,760
enough protractor allegedly yeah yeah

2120
01:11:07,439 --> 01:11:11,919
god you you're like auto cancelling this

2121
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:14,000
is great um my ratings are going to go

2122
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:17,039
up man this is going to be great uh if

2123
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:18,800
you want actual signs go listen to brian

2124
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:21,439
if you want all of these conspiracy

2125
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:23,199
theories or aka the truth about flat

2126
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:24,399
earth

2127
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:26,238
uh so

2128
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:27,279
he what he used was the following

2129
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:30,799
triangle

2130
01:11:27,279 --> 01:11:32,079
there are um proto-galaxy sized objects

2131
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:33,520
in the cmb

2132
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:35,279
the cosmic microwave background has

2133
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:38,080
these patches and so you can make a

2134
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:41,920
triangle out of the diameter of one of

2135
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:43,760
these uh blobs of primordial plasma the

2136
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:45,199
soup that constitutes the early universe

2137
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,360
it's just hydrogen it's very simple

2138
01:11:45,198 --> 01:11:49,119
material understand hydrogen electrons

2139
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:51,519
and radiation very simple plasma

2140
01:11:49,119 --> 01:11:54,079
physicist sun understand it

2141
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:55,440
the diameter is you know one base of the

2142
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:57,600
triangle and then the distance to the

2143
01:11:55,439 --> 01:11:59,359
earth is the other two legs so he

2144
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:01,280
measured along with his colleagues at

2145
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:03,119
caltech and then university of rome and

2146
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:05,359
that's other group at princeton

2147
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:07,679
measured uh the angle

2148
01:12:05,359 --> 01:12:09,759
uh interior angle effectively very very

2149
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,199
accurately and showed that it added up

2150
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:13,920
to 180 degrees

2151
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:15,198
can you localize accurately the patches

2152
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,199
in the cmb

2153
01:12:15,198 --> 01:12:19,198
can you know like where they could like

2154
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:20,879
trace them back location-wise you can

2155
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:22,639
know where they are but more than that

2156
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,679
there's so many of these patches they're

2157
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:28,400
about one square degree on the sky the

2158
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:30,560
sky you may know a sphere has about 44

2159
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:33,198
000 square degrees and a sphere so

2160
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,280
there's literally 44 000 of these size

2161
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:36,399
patches over which he could do these

2162
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:38,479
kind of measurements to build up very

2163
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:40,000
good statistics that's not exactly how

2164
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:41,919
they do it or how they did it on this

2165
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,960
experiment called boomerang but they did

2166
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:46,480
measure very accurately the uh what was

2167
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,158
called the first doppler peak or

2168
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:50,799
acoustic peak in the plasma the

2169
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:53,920
primordial plasma that's fast so um

2170
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:56,320
the sphere has 44 approximately 44

2171
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:57,760
thousand thousand square degrees so to

2172
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:59,599
cover a sphere

2173
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,880
that's a it's a very kind of important

2174
01:12:59,600 --> 01:13:02,239
data collection thing when you're

2175
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,319
sitting on a sphere and you're looking

2176
01:13:02,238 --> 01:13:06,238
out into the yeah into the observable

2177
01:13:04,319 --> 01:13:07,759
universe so there's a lot of

2178
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:10,079
there's a lot of patches to work with

2179
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:12,400
yeah and in fact a lot of the fast kind

2180
01:13:10,079 --> 01:13:14,238
of algorithmic decomposition of spheres

2181
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:16,639
and and machine learning in the early

2182
01:13:14,238 --> 01:13:18,479
2000s still used today was created out

2183
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:20,000
of this field by data analysts using

2184
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:20,879
this thing called hierarchical equal

2185
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:23,679
area

2186
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:25,600
triangles called heel heel heel picks is

2187
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:27,760
what it's called and just stitch all the

2188
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,600
stuff together and that's

2189
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:32,000
and stitch it together very accurately

2190
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,000
yeah get high statistical significance

2191
01:13:32,000 --> 01:13:36,560
in order to reduce these statistical

2192
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:38,079
errors very clean signal and uh

2193
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:39,760
measurement device to produce the

2194
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:41,760
systematic errors those are the two

2195
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:43,520
predominant uh sources of error in any

2196
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,719
measurement those that can be improved

2197
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:45,760
by more and more measurement you know

2198
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:47,600
you take more and more measurements of

2199
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,520
this table you'll get slightly better

2200
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,920
each time but you only win as the number

2201
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,520
of the the one over the square root of

2202
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,600
the number of measurements but the

2203
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,040
square root of 44 000 is pretty big so

2204
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,480
they were able to get a very accurate

2205
01:13:57,039 --> 01:13:59,519
measurement again it's not exactly how

2206
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:01,678
they did it they also have to do a

2207
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,840
fourier analysis decompose that do a

2208
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:05,600
power spectrum filtration windows

2209
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:08,079
there's a lot of work that goes into it

2210
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:10,159
image analysis and then comparing that

2211
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:12,158
with cosmological parameters very simple

2212
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:14,238
model just six different numbers that go

2213
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:15,599
into a model that made a prediction and

2214
01:14:14,238 --> 01:14:17,279
one of those is the geometry of the

2215
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,440
universe pops out and that is the

2216
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:21,359
universe has zero spatial curvature and

2217
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:23,759
that was called boomerang so he had just

2218
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:25,279
come off of this now let me remind you

2219
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,199
who is the first person you know to

2220
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:29,279
measure the curvature of the earth it's

2221
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:31,839
a guy named aristophanes in the you know

2222
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:33,119
whatever live around aristotle's time

2223
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,640
his name is in the history book so this

2224
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:36,960
guy andrew lang

2225
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,800
i was like he's like the next aristotle

2226
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,880
aristothe like i just wanted to work for

2227
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,199
this guy you know he was clearly had

2228
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:45,840
this brand he was about 40 at the time

2229
01:14:43,198 --> 01:14:47,359
california scientist of the year i i was

2230
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:50,480
sure he was going to win a nobel prize

2231
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:52,238
for that and i knew that he you know so

2232
01:14:50,479 --> 01:14:54,879
i went down to caltech to give my job

2233
01:14:52,238 --> 01:14:57,119
talk and he said you know i love it you

2234
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,480
got a job and before i could even you

2235
01:14:57,119 --> 01:15:00,238
know before he finished the sentence i

2236
01:14:58,479 --> 01:15:01,599
said i'll take it you know like it was

2237
01:15:00,238 --> 01:15:03,599
too good to be true

2238
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:05,760
and i started working there at caltech

2239
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:07,600
and slowly but surely because caltech's

2240
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,280
a rich private university

2241
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:11,280
at that time run by a nobel prize winner

2242
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:12,960
by the name of david baltimore

2243
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:14,559
he just wrote us a check baltimore wrote

2244
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,480
us a check and said get started on this

2245
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,199
idea and so we started coming with the

2246
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:21,519
idea for what i later named bicep by

2247
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:23,678
background imaging cosmic extragalactic

2248
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:25,440
polarization which is kind of ironic

2249
01:15:23,679 --> 01:15:26,640
because we ended up measuring galactic

2250
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:29,599
polarization we'll get to that in a

2251
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,800
minute um but along the way the idea was

2252
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,880
very simple we're going to make the

2253
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:35,199
simplest telescope you can possibly make

2254
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:37,039
which is a refracting telescope your

2255
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:39,919
eyes you have two refracting telescopes

2256
01:15:37,039 --> 01:15:41,679
in your head only way you know forward

2257
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:43,119
is making things more complex right and

2258
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,039
when you make things complex in science

2259
01:15:43,119 --> 01:15:47,039
you introduce the possibility for

2260
01:15:45,039 --> 01:15:48,560
systematic errors and so we want to

2261
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:49,760
build the cleanest instrument turns out

2262
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:52,159
a cleanest instrument you can build and

2263
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:54,159
astronomy is a refracting telescope we

2264
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:56,960
also had to unlike that telescope or

2265
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:58,238
galileo's we had to use very sensitive

2266
01:15:56,960 --> 01:16:01,359
detectors

2267
01:15:58,238 --> 01:16:03,519
that were cooled less than 1 20th of the

2268
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,519
temperature of the cosmic background

2269
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:07,520
itself which is the coolest temperature

2270
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:10,080
in the whole universe so we had to cool

2271
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,159
these down to about 0.1 or 0.2 degrees

2272
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,760
kelvin above absolute zero

2273
01:16:12,158 --> 01:16:15,599
to do that we need to put it inside of a

2274
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:18,000
huge vacuum chamber and suck out all the

2275
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,320
air molecules and water molecules and

2276
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,560
take it to a very very special place

2277
01:16:20,319 --> 01:16:24,799
called the south pole antarctica from

2278
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:26,640
which i retrieved for you a patch there

2279
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,480
it is over there

2280
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,320
so when you go there you get these

2281
01:16:28,479 --> 01:16:32,238
bright red jackets

2282
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:34,158
bright oh yeah

2283
01:16:32,238 --> 01:16:36,000
somebody was born in the soviet union we

2284
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:38,799
obviously like to call it red united

2285
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:41,679
states antarctic program

2286
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:44,000
the national science foundation and the

2287
01:16:41,679 --> 01:16:45,359
base is called the amundsen scott south

2288
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:46,640
polar station

2289
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,399
so it's a little known fact of

2290
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,239
geopolitics that whatever country

2291
01:16:48,399 --> 01:16:52,319
occupies a region

2292
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:53,839
has ownership over it now there is a

2293
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:57,119
treaty in antarctica you can't use it

2294
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:58,400
for military purposes for mining etc etc

2295
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:00,559
but i don't know if you know but about

2296
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:03,039
12 years ago putin sent a submarine to

2297
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:04,560
the north pole there's no land at this

2298
01:17:03,039 --> 01:17:07,679
at the north pole right so what did he

2299
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:09,679
do he stuck it on the ocean underneath

2300
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:11,199
but the south pole is on a continent

2301
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:13,520
called antarctica which was first

2302
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:14,879
reached about 110 years ago first time

2303
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,280
in human history

2304
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,760
um antarctica means the opposite of the

2305
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,279
bear that means like no bears there

2306
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,039
basically opposite of where polar bears

2307
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,399
are arctic is i mean it's polar bear

2308
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:26,000
that's where uh

2309
01:17:24,399 --> 01:17:27,439
i did not know that yeah fascinating so

2310
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,520
antarctica means the opposite place of

2311
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:30,719
that so humans never even saw it let

2312
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,440
alone went to the south pole which is

2313
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:35,679
kind of in the middle of that continent

2314
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:37,119
we went to take this telescope somewhere

2315
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:40,158
extremely dry

2316
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:42,158
it turns out the sahara desert san diego

2317
01:17:40,158 --> 01:17:44,639
texas and there's no place like the

2318
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:46,799
south pole or chile those are the two

2319
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,079
premier places on earth of course you'd

2320
01:17:46,800 --> 01:17:49,760
like to go into space there's no water

2321
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:51,920
in space so it's not about

2322
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:55,039
um it's not about cold it's about dry

2323
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:58,079
exactly so that's why for example you

2324
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:59,679
can take this uh vodka and you could put

2325
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:01,359
it in this cup right and we could take

2326
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,880
it over to a microwave somewhere and

2327
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:04,559
heat it up

2328
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,079
after two minutes the water's three

2329
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:07,760
minutes the water's boiling you can't

2330
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:09,039
touch it take it from me don't touch it

2331
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:10,960
but you can touch the mug and take it

2332
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:13,198
out if you want to right why because the

2333
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:14,640
mug is totally bone dry but the

2334
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:16,319
microwaves get absorbed by the water

2335
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:18,079
molecules because water molecules

2336
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:19,840
resonate exactly at these microwave

2337
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:21,519
frequencies so we don't want these

2338
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,679
precious photons

2339
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,000
420 of them traveling per cubic

2340
01:18:23,679 --> 01:18:27,600
centimeter from the big bang itself to

2341
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,520
get absorbed in some water molecule in

2342
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:30,800
the earth's atmosphere so you take it to

2343
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,280
a place with the fewest number of water

2344
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,039
molecules per per square centimeter of

2345
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:36,719
surface area and that happens to be

2346
01:18:35,039 --> 01:18:38,880
either chile or my other project the

2347
01:18:36,719 --> 01:18:40,480
simon's observatory is located or you

2348
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:42,960
take it to the south pole

2349
01:18:40,479 --> 01:18:45,119
we took it to the south pole and uh

2350
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:49,039
spent a couple of uh months of my life

2351
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:51,039
down there and it's like being on hoth

2352
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:54,560
you know it's like it's a completely

2353
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:56,880
otherworldly environment ice planer flat

2354
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,640
as a pancake you

2355
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,760
like and and the buildings are built up

2356
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,199
on stilts

2357
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:03,199
they're built up because the snow will

2358
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:05,678
otherwise cover them over

2359
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:08,158
the nearest medical facilities or 4 000

2360
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:09,600
miles away if you have any issues with

2361
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:11,198
your wisdom teeth they yank them before

2362
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,320
you go down there

2363
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:13,599
if you have any issues with your

2364
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:15,439
appendix they'll cut it out of you

2365
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:17,920
before you go down there the russians at

2366
01:19:15,439 --> 01:19:20,000
vostok base not too far away about 600

2367
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,440
miles away the doctors there there's a

2368
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:22,880
famous picture of one of them operating

2369
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:24,639
on himself

2370
01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:26,880
taking out his own appendix in the

2371
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,960
middle of winter by himself so harsh

2372
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:31,039
conditions science in the harshest of

2373
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,800
conditions on earth at least

2374
01:19:31,039 --> 01:19:34,640
and we go to those great lengths because

2375
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,440
it's a pristine environment to observe

2376
01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:39,280
these precious photons and we built this

2377
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:42,319
telescope and it weighs you know tens of

2378
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:44,719
thousands of pounds and it had to scan

2379
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:47,039
the sky almost like it's a robot i mean

2380
01:19:44,719 --> 01:19:49,359
it's scanning the sky almost unattended

2381
01:19:47,039 --> 01:19:50,880
it needed uh that we have a guy who

2382
01:19:49,359 --> 01:19:52,158
spends a year of his life down there a

2383
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,159
girl who spends a year of their life

2384
01:19:52,158 --> 01:19:56,238
down there they're called winter overs

2385
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:57,679
they arrive in sometimes as early as

2386
01:19:56,238 --> 01:20:00,639
november and they don't leave until the

2387
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:03,119
following december and we always joke

2388
01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:04,560
we'll pay you 75 000 you just have to

2389
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:06,079
work for one night of your life that's

2390
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,760
that's all but

2391
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:10,559
it's a long night

2392
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:12,560
and what bicep is and uh i couldn't

2393
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,400
bring my my polarized sunglasses here so

2394
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,400
i brought these actual polarizers here

2395
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:19,039
so if you take this and put in front of

2396
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:21,279
your telescope there

2397
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:23,920
you have now made a polarimeter you've

2398
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:25,920
made a polarization sensitive telescope

2399
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,079
now you may not be able to immediately

2400
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:30,319
know how you would use such a thing but

2401
01:20:28,079 --> 01:20:32,880
one way to think about now take this guy

2402
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:34,960
and look at a light look at a light

2403
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:37,279
source put one up to your eye and now

2404
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:39,760
put the other one in front of it

2405
01:20:37,279 --> 01:20:42,238
anywhere and now rotate them

2406
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:44,400
what happens to the light source

2407
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:46,238
it becomes brighter and dimmer and

2408
01:20:44,399 --> 01:20:48,399
brighter and dimmer yeah so it's called

2409
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:50,799
a quadrupolar pattern right so it's

2410
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:51,599
repeating it goes bright dim bright dim

2411
01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:54,320
uh

2412
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:56,960
it double rotates twice in intensity for

2413
01:20:54,319 --> 01:20:58,000
every single physical rotation

2414
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,079
and that's because of the property of

2415
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:03,520
the photon the photon is a spin one

2416
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:05,600
field but the polarization of light

2417
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,080
is it's the axis at which its electric

2418
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,600
field is oscillating its electric field

2419
01:21:08,079 --> 01:21:11,359
is marching straight up and straight

2420
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:13,199
down and so therefore vertical

2421
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:15,198
polarization is the same as

2422
01:21:13,198 --> 01:21:16,960
negative vertical polarization and so

2423
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:18,479
you get the same pattern as you rotate

2424
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:21,920
two times for every one physical

2425
01:21:18,479 --> 01:21:23,839
rotation so it's like a spin a spin two

2426
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,079
object so now if you put that in front

2427
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:27,760
of the telescope

2428
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:29,760
you can do one of two things now you're

2429
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,440
polarizing all the light that's going in

2430
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,880
because you have one of the polarizers

2431
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:34,719
and then you can analyze it as you

2432
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,880
rotate the other one you can analyze it

2433
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,800
and change the amount of polarization

2434
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,800
or you can put this kind of very special

2435
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:43,279
crystal in here there's a crystal it's

2436
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,800
called calcite this is from lex luthor

2437
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:46,800
not lex friedman

2438
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,800
this crystal put it on top of your

2439
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,719
printed notes there and tell me what

2440
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:53,279
does it look like

2441
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:53,279
there's uh

2442
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:58,639
like i could see everything twice it's a

2443
01:21:56,479 --> 01:22:00,399
double image it's a double image that is

2444
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:02,480
a special crystal that has two different

2445
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:04,799
indices of refraction

2446
01:22:02,479 --> 01:22:07,119
so light emerging which is unpolarized

2447
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,719
from the black ink comes out

2448
01:22:07,119 --> 01:22:11,039
and it splits into two different

2449
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:12,880
directions and it could split even more

2450
01:22:11,039 --> 01:22:14,238
if i made the crystal give you my more

2451
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:15,359
expensive crystal but that's all i have

2452
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:17,439
what is the crystal with this kind of

2453
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:19,359
property called it's called calcite this

2454
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:22,079
is crystal it's called birefringent

2455
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:24,479
crystal bi means two refrigerant means

2456
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:26,158
refracting so this is a special type of

2457
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:27,439
material that

2458
01:22:26,158 --> 01:22:30,238
separates light based on its

2459
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:33,439
polarization pretty clean

2460
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:34,399
by signal yeah it's it's cleanly

2461
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:36,638
too

2462
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:38,000
yeah see i'm seeing two very cleanly

2463
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,440
it's very crisp right so that's that's

2464
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,920
yours to keep with every time you host

2465
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:44,719
me now take the polarizer underneath

2466
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:46,399
your left hand uh yep put it on top of

2467
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:49,198
the crystal

2468
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:51,679
and kind of move it back and forth wow

2469
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:54,319
this is incredible you can switch as you

2470
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:56,319
rotate you switch from one

2471
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:58,639
uh signal to the other so it's one of

2472
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:01,359
the refractions to the other

2473
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:03,679
whoa so that is now you are analyzing

2474
01:23:01,359 --> 01:23:05,198
the polarization you are confirming the

2475
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:07,039
light comes out of the crystal two

2476
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:10,079
different types of polarization

2477
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:12,639
and effectively what we do is we have

2478
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:14,639
those two things if you like but working

2479
01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,079
in the microwave so our detect that's

2480
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,079
where this the cosmic photons are

2481
01:23:16,079 --> 01:23:20,079
brightest in the microwave regime in the

2482
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:21,760
electromagnetic spectrum and we're

2483
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:23,279
coupling that to a refracting telescope

2484
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:25,360
but your eyes are refracting telescopes

2485
01:23:23,279 --> 01:23:26,960
so you are a polarimeter right now

2486
01:23:25,359 --> 01:23:29,839
the human eye can actually slightly

2487
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:31,679
detect polarization um but otherwise it

2488
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,279
mainly detects its intensity of light

2489
01:23:31,679 --> 01:23:35,199
and the color that's what we call color

2490
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:36,399
and intensity brightness so you're

2491
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:38,000
devising a

2492
01:23:36,399 --> 01:23:40,638
instrument that's very precisely

2493
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,800
measuring that exactly and doing so in

2494
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:45,199
the microwave region with detectors not

2495
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:48,560
made of biological human eyes retina

2496
01:23:45,198 --> 01:23:50,399
cells but of superconductors and uh

2497
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,560
things called balometers and and this

2498
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:54,960
has to be done at temperatures close to

2499
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,880
absolute zero under vacuum conditions

2500
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,480
one billionth of the pressure we feel

2501
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,719
here at sea level

2502
01:23:58,479 --> 01:24:03,039
so why is it that this the kind of

2503
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:03,920
device could win a nobel prize

2504
01:24:03,039 --> 01:24:05,840
so

2505
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:07,440
when the cmb was discovered it was

2506
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:09,920
discovered serendipitously there were

2507
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:12,799
two uh radio astronomers

2508
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,480
working at the time at bell laboratories

2509
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:16,079
now why would bell laboratories be

2510
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:18,238
employing radio astronomers bell

2511
01:24:16,079 --> 01:24:20,399
laboratories is kind of like um

2512
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:22,238
like apple or you know is it like a

2513
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:23,519
think tank or you know it's google let's

2514
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:24,959
say it was like google google has like

2515
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,639
google x it has this thing on that thing

2516
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:29,119
right um

2517
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:30,560
so they were working there but imagine

2518
01:24:29,119 --> 01:24:32,158
if google was employing radio

2519
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,000
astronomers like they were actively

2520
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:35,439
recruiting why would they do that well

2521
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:38,158
it turns out that was the beginning in

2522
01:24:35,439 --> 01:24:40,879
the 1960s was the first commercial

2523
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:41,839
satellite launch for communication

2524
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:43,520
and so

2525
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:45,360
so bell labs which would later become

2526
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:47,520
the telephone you know part of a t and

2527
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:49,039
the tele early telephone company later

2528
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:51,760
invent the first cell phone the year i

2529
01:24:49,039 --> 01:24:54,479
was born um and they would take that uh

2530
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:56,320
1946 and they would take that uh

2531
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:58,879
telescope technology that radio

2532
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:00,000
astronomers had developed and they would

2533
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,520
use that

2534
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,719
to see if they could improve the signal

2535
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,880
to noise of the satellites that they

2536
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,560
were seeing and they found they couldn't

2537
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:08,560
they found that they could not improve

2538
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:10,400
the signal noise ratio of the first

2539
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,239
telecommunications satellite it was like

2540
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:14,238
the equivalent to one kilobit per second

2541
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:16,399
modem and they were bouncing signals

2542
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:18,238
from uh you know from the west coast up

2543
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:20,799
to the satellite bouncing it down

2544
01:25:18,238 --> 01:25:23,439
landing it um uh in new jersey of all

2545
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:25,440
places in northern uh northern new

2546
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:26,719
jersey holmdale new jersey

2547
01:25:25,439 --> 01:25:27,839
and these radio stars couldn't get rid

2548
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:29,920
of the signal so they said well new

2549
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:31,039
jersey's not far from new york

2550
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,800
let's see if the signal is coming from

2551
01:25:31,039 --> 01:25:34,079
new york nope not coming from new york

2552
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:35,360
let's see if it changes with the year

2553
01:25:34,079 --> 01:25:37,600
maybe it's coming from the galaxy which

2554
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:40,158
was also discovered there by janski in

2555
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:41,920
1930 something so in the the not being

2556
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:44,319
able to reduce the signal or increase

2557
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:45,039
the signal to noise ratio the noise it

2558
01:25:44,319 --> 01:25:46,639
was

2559
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:48,158
they knew the signal was right they

2560
01:25:46,639 --> 01:25:50,079
couldn't get rid of the noise and there

2561
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:52,238
was excess noise over the model that had

2562
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:54,079
not only been predicted by them but had

2563
01:25:52,238 --> 01:25:56,319
been measured by a previous guy a guy by

2564
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:58,158
the name of edward ohm he measured the

2565
01:25:56,319 --> 01:26:00,399
same signal found that there was this

2566
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:02,399
hiss of static of radio static that he

2567
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:04,638
could not get rid of that had a value of

2568
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:06,559
about three kelvin so you can translate

2569
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:08,960
remember i said uh if you take a radio

2570
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:11,360
telescope and you have pointed at an

2571
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,399
object that's hot the radio telescope's

2572
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:14,158
detector will get to the same

2573
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:16,399
temperature as the object it's a

2574
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:17,679
principle of radio thermodynamics so

2575
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:18,879
it's a really interesting thing it's a

2576
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:20,880
thermometer you can stick it into

2577
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:23,039
jupiter from here on earth it's amazing

2578
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:25,039
they were and so we in radio astronomy

2579
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:27,519
characterize our signal not by its

2580
01:26:25,039 --> 01:26:29,600
intensity but by its temperature

2581
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:31,199
so he found this guy edward um oh

2582
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:33,360
there's this three kelvin signal i can't

2583
01:26:31,198 --> 01:26:36,158
get rid of it it must be i did my era

2584
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:37,679
analysis wrong and i would give him an f

2585
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:39,839
if he was one of my you know first-year

2586
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:41,920
students um but he's just attributed to

2587
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:44,239
lack of of understanding these other

2588
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:46,399
guys penseus and wilson who are also

2589
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:49,119
radio astronomers they said no let's

2590
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:50,479
build another experiment put that inside

2591
01:26:49,119 --> 01:26:52,880
of our telescope

2592
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:55,519
and do what's called calibration put

2593
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:57,520
inject a known source of signal

2594
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:59,360
every second that has a temperature of

2595
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,239
about four kelvin because the signal

2596
01:26:59,359 --> 01:27:01,759
that they're trying to get rid of is

2597
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:02,959
about three kelvin and you want to have

2598
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:04,960
it as close as possible to the

2599
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,960
pernicious signal as possible they did

2600
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,239
that once a second so they got billions

2601
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:10,079
of measurements millions of measurements

2602
01:27:08,238 --> 01:27:11,119
over the course of several months years

2603
01:27:10,079 --> 01:27:12,880
and even

2604
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:14,319
by the end of millions of measurements

2605
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,600
for sure

2606
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:17,039
and they found they couldn't get rid of

2607
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,120
it either but they measured it was

2608
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:21,198
exactly 2.7265

2609
01:27:19,119 --> 01:27:23,679
you know degrees kelvin so uh how does

2610
01:27:21,198 --> 01:27:25,359
uh having a four kelvin

2611
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:27,039
source how does the calibration work

2612
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:28,319
just that it could be it could be larger

2613
01:27:27,039 --> 01:27:29,840
imagine like you're trying to calibrate

2614
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:32,000
the microphone like you could do it with

2615
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,760
like a really loud sound but the gain

2616
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,840
would start to compress so there are

2617
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:37,679
amplifiers downstream from the detector

2618
01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:39,440
in every experiment that i've ever

2619
01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,440
worked on and they only have a linear

2620
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:43,198
region over a very small region and you

2621
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:44,559
want to keep it as linear as possible

2622
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:46,238
that means you want if you're trying to

2623
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,679
get rid of you're trying to compare like

2624
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:49,599
a voice and you're trying to compare

2625
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:51,440
that to a jet engine it's not as it's

2626
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:53,360
not going to be as as easy on the on the

2627
01:27:51,439 --> 01:27:55,839
amplifiers as getting you know a

2628
01:27:53,359 --> 01:27:57,920
slightly lo a gong or something you know

2629
01:27:55,840 --> 01:27:58,960
so the idea if the noise is present in

2630
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,480
both

2631
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:02,319
there's a noise present in both and you

2632
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:03,919
get you measure what they did is they

2633
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,079
made a separate measurement just to the

2634
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,760
calibration system which they measured

2635
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:09,519
exactly very well four kelvin is the

2636
01:28:07,760 --> 01:28:11,199
temperature of liquid helium that's a

2637
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,159
temperature that's not going to change

2638
01:28:11,198 --> 01:28:14,238
and it's certainly not going to change

2639
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:16,158
over the time scale of one second and so

2640
01:28:14,238 --> 01:28:17,678
they could compare unknown signal known

2641
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:19,279
signal an unknown signal known signal

2642
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:20,158
like a scale like a balance so another

2643
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:22,238
way to think about it is like this

2644
01:28:20,158 --> 01:28:24,079
you've seen these libra kind of balances

2645
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:26,158
where you put two weights in a pan right

2646
01:28:24,079 --> 01:28:27,840
what happens if you put like a one ounce

2647
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:29,359
weight on one side and a 20 kilogram

2648
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,800
weight and you don't get any measurement

2649
01:28:29,359 --> 01:28:32,158
right but you do get kind of a

2650
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:34,079
measurement if they're close in weight

2651
01:28:32,158 --> 01:28:36,399
that's why they use four kelvin got it

2652
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:38,079
but just to linger on the fact that

2653
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:39,039
there's a romantic element to the fact

2654
01:28:38,079 --> 01:28:41,119
that you're

2655
01:28:39,039 --> 01:28:42,158
um arriving at the same temperature

2656
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:43,599
that's kind of fascinating and you're

2657
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:45,599
measuring stuff in terms of you're

2658
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:48,800
measuring signal in terms of temperature

2659
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:50,159
at the source yeah so you get to i mean

2660
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,800
there's something about temperature

2661
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:54,479
that's intimate yeah it's cool yeah

2662
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:56,239
especially since you know

2663
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:57,919
all life is basically you know

2664
01:28:56,238 --> 01:28:59,759
conversion of energy and trying to

2665
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:02,639
control entropy which is then related to

2666
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:05,199
thermodynamics exactly in that way and

2667
01:29:02,639 --> 01:29:07,039
this is um a very crucial

2668
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:08,719
kind of thing to do in science because

2669
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:10,479
they weren't looking for the signal they

2670
01:29:08,719 --> 01:29:12,639
found it accidentally these two

2671
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:14,399
scientists penzias and wilson

2672
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,400
and i like to think those kind of

2673
01:29:14,399 --> 01:29:18,238
discoveries are the purest in science

2674
01:29:16,399 --> 01:29:20,319
like when you see something isaac asimov

2675
01:29:18,238 --> 01:29:22,959
once said like the most important

2676
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:25,599
reaction as a scientist is not eureka

2677
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:28,079
which means in greek as you know i have

2678
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:29,840
found it no he said no he said like

2679
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:32,079
that's weird like that's a much better

2680
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,319
reaction or that's freaking cool like

2681
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:37,039
that's a scientist not like oh i found

2682
01:29:34,319 --> 01:29:38,639
one because surprise yeah yeah because

2683
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:39,760
if you find what you're going to find

2684
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,159
that's what

2685
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,800
leads us susceptible to confirmation

2686
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:46,719
bias which is deadly and so you know as

2687
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,159
close to deadly as possible so how does

2688
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:50,960
that take us to something that's

2689
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:53,198
potentially worthy of a nobel prize ah

2690
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:55,679
so penzis and wilson weren't looking for

2691
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:58,960
a signal they ended up discovering the

2692
01:29:55,679 --> 01:30:01,520
heat left over from the fusion of uh

2693
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:02,960
helium from hydrogen etc

2694
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:04,880
and that was a serendipitous discovery

2695
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:07,520
they won the nobel prize in 1978 it was

2696
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:09,359
the first one ever a word in cosmology

2697
01:30:07,520 --> 01:30:10,960
my reasoning is what if you could

2698
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:12,799
explain not only how the elements got

2699
01:30:10,960 --> 01:30:15,760
formed but how the whole universe got

2700
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:18,560
formed and kill off every other model of

2701
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:21,119
science so if that weren't enough every

2702
01:30:18,560 --> 01:30:23,920
scientist you know worth his or her salt

2703
01:30:21,119 --> 01:30:25,920
had told me and andrew lang and our

2704
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:28,158
colleagues this is a slam dunk nobel

2705
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:30,319
prize if you could do it because it was

2706
01:30:28,158 --> 01:30:31,920
really explaining again the stakes of

2707
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:34,000
this science is different than like

2708
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:36,319
super fluidity plasma physics when you

2709
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:39,279
talk about the origin of the universe

2710
01:30:36,319 --> 01:30:41,679
it ties into everything it ties into

2711
01:30:39,279 --> 01:30:43,920
philosophy theology

2712
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,279
you realize if paul steinhardt

2713
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:47,279
is correct

2714
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:49,599
that the bible can't be correct in other

2715
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:51,599
words the bible's correct now it isn't

2716
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:53,039
falsified if you like if you believe it

2717
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:54,639
i'm not i never use the bible as a

2718
01:30:53,039 --> 01:30:56,399
science book obviously

2719
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:57,600
but the bible speaks of a singular

2720
01:30:56,399 --> 01:30:59,119
beginning

2721
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,280
what if you knew for sure the universe

2722
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:03,760
was not singular it was it would be more

2723
01:31:01,279 --> 01:31:06,479
like the cosmology of akhenaten and

2724
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:08,560
egyptians than the biblical torah old

2725
01:31:06,479 --> 01:31:10,799
testament if you will narrative

2726
01:31:08,560 --> 01:31:12,480
so in my mind the stakes could not be

2727
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,920
higher and again it's not an effect

2728
01:31:12,479 --> 01:31:15,519
because we need plasma physics we need

2729
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:17,760
we need every type of physics except

2730
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:19,440
maybe biophysics and like we you

2731
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:21,360
literally use every branch of physics

2732
01:31:19,439 --> 01:31:23,519
and thermodynamics superconductivity

2733
01:31:21,359 --> 01:31:25,519
quantum mechanic all that goes into our

2734
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,880
understanding of the instrument and

2735
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:28,719
even further if you want to understand

2736
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:31,359
the theory that predicts the signal that

2737
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:33,520
we purport to measure so i re i

2738
01:31:31,359 --> 01:31:35,198
rationalize that if pensions and wilson

2739
01:31:33,520 --> 01:31:37,679
won the nobel prize for this

2740
01:31:35,198 --> 01:31:39,599
if hulson taylor won the nobel prize for

2741
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:42,399
indirectly detecting gravitational waves

2742
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:44,239
this is decades before ligo

2743
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:46,319
by me detecting gravitational waves

2744
01:31:44,238 --> 01:31:49,198
indirectly detecting the how the

2745
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:51,359
universe began detecting the origin of

2746
01:31:49,198 --> 01:31:53,119
the input initial conditions for the big

2747
01:31:51,359 --> 01:31:56,079
bang nucleosynthesis which won the nobel

2748
01:31:53,119 --> 01:31:58,079
prize in 1983 these are like five nobel

2749
01:31:56,079 --> 01:31:58,960
prizes you know potentially for that

2750
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:00,719
reason

2751
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,279
it seemed as close as you could possibly

2752
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,600
get to being a slam dunk to outdo what

2753
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:07,519
my father did to do you know really this

2754
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,280
impossible and at that time lex you know

2755
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,120
again i'm

2756
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:13,519
you know it sounds weird because people

2757
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:15,198
like oh you wouldn't you know you you

2758
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,800
don't really you know you still want the

2759
01:32:15,198 --> 01:32:19,039
nobel prize you're still like greedy and

2760
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,239
look you wrote another book about um and

2761
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:21,679
i always joke i'm like well if you want

2762
01:32:20,238 --> 01:32:23,279
to see if i'm a hypocrite just get them

2763
01:32:21,679 --> 01:32:25,039
to give me the nobel prize in literature

2764
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:28,079
yeah and if i accept it then i'm a

2765
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:29,920
hypocrite but um wait well we'll get to

2766
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:31,600
your current feelings on the nobel prize

2767
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:32,880
in terms of hippocrates and so on

2768
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,440
but

2769
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:38,319
so there's this ambition

2770
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:39,919
let's say this device this kind of

2771
01:32:38,319 --> 01:32:42,158
signal could unlock many of the

2772
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:44,158
mysteries about the early universe and

2773
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:47,119
so there's excitement there

2774
01:32:44,158 --> 01:32:49,519
so let's take it then further i mean

2775
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:51,840
there's a human story here of a bit of

2776
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:54,480
heartbreak not only

2777
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,119
was this possibly worth a nobel prize

2778
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:59,519
if the nobel prize was given

2779
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:01,439
you were excluded from the list of three

2780
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,880
that would get the nobel prize

2781
01:33:01,439 --> 01:33:05,039
so

2782
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,679
why were you excluded maybe that's the

2783
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:10,319
place to tell the story of bicep 2. yeah

2784
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:12,800
so bicep two like you know iphones or i

2785
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:14,079
know you're an android fanboy but um you

2786
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:15,840
know every year they get a little bit

2787
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:18,559
better they get more megapixels they get

2788
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,520
more optics triplex zoom whatever okay

2789
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:21,440
right

2790
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,440
we upgraded our detectors as well the

2791
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:25,759
initial detectors were based on what are

2792
01:33:23,439 --> 01:33:27,119
called semiconductors they they have

2793
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:29,360
certain properties that make them very

2794
01:33:27,119 --> 01:33:30,960
difficult to replicate at scale and we

2795
01:33:29,359 --> 01:33:33,439
wanted to make them into uh into

2796
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:35,359
superconductors which had a virtue that

2797
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:37,039
you could then mass produce them why

2798
01:33:35,359 --> 01:33:38,880
superconductors well again we're

2799
01:33:37,039 --> 01:33:41,359
measuring heat so one thing about a

2800
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:44,079
superconductor is that it transitions

2801
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:45,439
from some finite resistance to zero

2802
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:47,439
resistance

2803
01:33:45,439 --> 01:33:49,599
over a very short span of temperature

2804
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:52,238
range that means you can use that very

2805
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:54,719
short span dependency as an accurate and

2806
01:33:52,238 --> 01:33:56,479
sensitive and precise thermometer

2807
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,000
and so my brilliant colleagues around

2808
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:00,559
the world in this case jamie pock and

2809
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:03,119
nowadays suzanne stags at princeton um

2810
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:05,600
they are just exquisitely making these

2811
01:34:03,119 --> 01:34:07,599
these sensors tens of thousands of them

2812
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:09,600
the initial bicep one instrument of

2813
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:12,079
course we just call the bicep uh that

2814
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,760
only had 98 detectors

2815
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:16,319
simon's observatory is going to have a

2816
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,880
hundred times more just in one of our

2817
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:22,479
four telescopes we're going to have 60

2818
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:24,480
000 detectors operating full time at 0.1

2819
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:27,519
degree above absolute zero in the

2820
01:34:24,479 --> 01:34:29,359
atacama desert we'll get there but

2821
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:32,480
in the case of the getting back to what

2822
01:34:29,359 --> 01:34:35,759
bicep did we upgraded made bicep two

2823
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:38,718
in january 2010

2824
01:34:35,760 --> 01:34:40,560
we had just installed in the exact same

2825
01:34:38,719 --> 01:34:42,639
uh

2826
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:44,480
location at the south pole in the same

2827
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:47,520
building which is ominously called the

2828
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:49,759
dark sector laboratory dsl still

2829
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:52,480
operating to this very day

2830
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:55,199
we installed a new receiver on the same

2831
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:57,439
platform as before very similar

2832
01:34:55,198 --> 01:34:59,439
identical optics cryogenics vacuum

2833
01:34:57,439 --> 01:35:02,479
everything except it went from 98

2834
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:04,079
detectors to 512 detectors so almost an

2835
01:35:02,479 --> 01:35:06,238
order of magnitude very substantial

2836
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:08,399
upgrade um and it had certain other

2837
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:11,039
features that made it even more powerful

2838
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:12,479
but then just a naive factor of five

2839
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:14,000
and then we started observing with that

2840
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:15,359
and we knew we'd have years to go and

2841
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,560
maybe we'd never see anything again

2842
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:18,479
we're looking for these tiny little

2843
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,560
reverberations in the fabric of space

2844
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:22,799
time produced close to the origin of the

2845
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:24,239
universe as we could ever get to

2846
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:26,719
so i was playing a role in that

2847
01:35:24,238 --> 01:35:28,399
obviously it had upgraded my

2848
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:31,039
version of the original idea that i had

2849
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:32,399
had for bicep uh with along with andrew

2850
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:35,118
lang

2851
01:35:32,399 --> 01:35:37,519
and in january of 2010 uh we were i was

2852
01:35:35,118 --> 01:35:39,439
at a meeting at uc berkeley and i got a

2853
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:41,199
call from andrew lang's uh or i was in a

2854
01:35:39,439 --> 01:35:43,919
meeting with andrew lang's thesis

2855
01:35:41,198 --> 01:35:46,638
advisor paul richards at uc berkeley

2856
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,800
and he said that andrew was dead he had

2857
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:50,880
taken his life by suicide

2858
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:52,639
and this is a man and i had already lost

2859
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:54,719
my father at this point

2860
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:57,279
in 2010 but he was like a father figure

2861
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,359
to me andrew he would give me

2862
01:35:57,279 --> 01:36:02,000
advice on marriage on like how i should

2863
01:35:59,359 --> 01:36:03,519
be with my kids and and um you know what

2864
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:05,760
was the most important way to move

2865
01:36:03,520 --> 01:36:07,760
through the academic ladder again he was

2866
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:09,440
pretty naturally suited to win the nobel

2867
01:36:07,760 --> 01:36:11,039
prize everyone always thought he would

2868
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:12,879
win it he still you know if he were

2869
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:15,279
alive he still could win it in fact his

2870
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:17,600
wife or his ex-wife won it francis

2871
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:20,399
arnold in uh 2018

2872
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:23,679
and um you know his power couple

2873
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:26,158
and it destroyed me for a long time

2874
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:28,399
because you know he was uh he was just

2875
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:30,638
this magical person i mean i couldn't

2876
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:32,799
conceive of my career my life

2877
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:34,719
um even like you know these these

2878
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:36,800
aspects of raising kids and being

2879
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:38,800
married without him

2880
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,880
and to do it in that way

2881
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:42,960
it felt like again i'm not you know he's

2882
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:44,880
got kids and i feel terrible for for

2883
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:46,239
them obviously but it did feel like a

2884
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,639
betrayal i mean i'm just being honest

2885
01:36:46,238 --> 01:36:50,319
with you it felt like why didn't the f

2886
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:52,639
did you not reach out you know i thought

2887
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:54,319
we were close and i couldn't you know i

2888
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:56,159
told him everything and i felt like he

2889
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:58,399
had told me everything

2890
01:36:56,158 --> 01:36:59,839
and now he was gone and then inevitably

2891
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:01,118
we had to keep running the instrument i

2892
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:03,600
mean there's millions of dollars

2893
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:05,519
invested careers at stake young people

2894
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,280
working tremendously hard

2895
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,560
and then here we were and like who's

2896
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:11,118
going to take over the lead he was the

2897
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,960
lead of the project at caltech and then

2898
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:14,719
it turned out that the

2899
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,319
other collaborators with whom i had been

2900
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:18,079
working for years and shared a lot of

2901
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:20,238
ups and downs with as well

2902
01:37:18,079 --> 01:37:21,840
they had you know decided to form a

2903
01:37:20,238 --> 01:37:23,678
collaboration in which i was no longer

2904
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:24,800
the principal investigator i was no

2905
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:26,880
longer one of the co-principal

2906
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:28,719
investigators as i was on bicep 1. so i

2907
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,359
continued on bicep 1 as the co-leader of

2908
01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:32,319
it

2909
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:33,759
but not on bicep 2. and um

2910
01:37:32,319 --> 01:37:35,599
you know obviously that was pretty

2911
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:37,039
painful this is all happening at the

2912
01:37:35,600 --> 01:37:40,239
same time as you

2913
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:42,158
as you lose this father figure

2914
01:37:40,238 --> 01:37:45,279
now there's this kind of

2915
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:47,359
just one betrayal in this in a way and

2916
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:49,920
there isn't another or something that

2917
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:51,439
feels like a betrayal yeah and he had

2918
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,600
you know kind of been the one the only

2919
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:55,599
one looking out for my interest in the

2920
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:57,920
new experiment i had moved from caltech

2921
01:37:55,600 --> 01:37:59,679
to uc san diego and there were other

2922
01:37:57,920 --> 01:38:01,679
postdocs in the mix all of whom would

2923
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:03,359
come there to work with him to get the

2924
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:05,279
you know the approbation that would then

2925
01:38:03,359 --> 01:38:06,639
lead to their careers taking off as it

2926
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:08,319
did for mine

2927
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:10,319
and um you know so there was a

2928
01:38:08,319 --> 01:38:13,920
competition i mean science is not free

2929
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:15,920
from egos and and uh and competition and

2930
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:18,399
and desires rightfully or wrongfully for

2931
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:20,399
credit and attribution was he the source

2932
01:38:18,399 --> 01:38:23,118
of strength and confidence for you as a

2933
01:38:20,399 --> 01:38:25,599
scientist as a man i mean

2934
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:28,319
we're we're kind of alone in this world

2935
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:31,600
as when you take on difficult things

2936
01:38:28,319 --> 01:38:34,000
we often kind of grasp but a few folks

2937
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:36,639
that give us strength yeah

2938
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:38,479
was he you're basically your only source

2939
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:40,560
of strength in this whole journey like

2940
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:41,678
primarily in terms of like this close

2941
01:38:40,560 --> 01:38:43,440
knit

2942
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:45,920
as a scientist there were really two

2943
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:47,519
there's one there's russian cosmologist

2944
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:50,239
alexander polnarov who thankfully is

2945
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:52,400
very much alive he's it was a queen mary

2946
01:38:50,238 --> 01:38:54,158
university now he's retired

2947
01:38:52,399 --> 01:38:56,238
he was kind of the theoretical you know

2948
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:58,879
cosmological father to me and then

2949
01:38:56,238 --> 01:39:00,158
andrew was this counterpoint that was

2950
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:02,480
teaching me

2951
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:04,559
you need to have a brand as a scientist

2952
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:06,158
every scientist has a brand and some of

2953
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:07,760
them don't protect it some of them don't

2954
01:39:06,158 --> 01:39:09,359
burnish it

2955
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:11,440
but some of the skills about being a

2956
01:39:09,359 --> 01:39:13,839
scientist we don't teach our students

2957
01:39:11,439 --> 01:39:14,960
involve how do you cultivate

2958
01:39:13,840 --> 01:39:17,520
a

2959
01:39:14,960 --> 01:39:20,079
scientific persona and he was the

2960
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:22,159
exemplar for that in addition to being

2961
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:23,519
the evonkular you know father figure

2962
01:39:22,158 --> 01:39:25,839
type character

2963
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:27,760
that really you know was the person i

2964
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:29,199
would talk to i had issues with

2965
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:30,719
when i had issues with my own students

2966
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:32,799
and he would tell me how those were and

2967
01:39:30,719 --> 01:39:33,840
he would tell me you know his misgivings

2968
01:39:32,800 --> 01:39:35,360
about

2969
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,600
about people that he worked with or

2970
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:39,920
things in his personal life and it was

2971
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,600
it was it was devastating but again like

2972
01:39:39,920 --> 01:39:43,679
who the hell am i i'm that's kid you

2973
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:45,920
know he lo his kids lost father you know

2974
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,920
it's so i feel guilty talking about it

2975
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,440
in that sense but it's just a reality

2976
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:52,000
you know well there is something that's

2977
01:39:49,439 --> 01:39:54,879
not often talked about as people who

2978
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:56,800
collaborate on scientific efforts

2979
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,880
i mean that's

2980
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:01,279
i don't again don't want to compare but

2981
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:04,000
you know it's it's sometimes when the

2982
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:07,519
collaborations are truly great it sounds

2983
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,520
similar as when um

2984
01:40:07,600 --> 01:40:11,280
veterans talk about

2985
01:40:09,359 --> 01:40:13,599
their time serving together there's

2986
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:15,439
there's a bond that's formed so like

2987
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,920
comparing family and this kind of thing

2988
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:20,638
is you know

2989
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:23,359
it uh is not productive but

2990
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:25,199
the depth of the bond is is nevertheless

2991
01:40:23,359 --> 01:40:28,079
um

2992
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:30,638
real because you're taking on something

2993
01:40:28,079 --> 01:40:32,000
you're taking on the impossible

2994
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:33,279
you're you're trying to achieve

2995
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,600
something sort of like there's this

2996
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:37,519
darkness this fog of mystery that we're

2997
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,960
all surrounded by

2998
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,119
which is um

2999
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:43,520
what the human condition is and you are

3000
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:45,279
like grasping at hope through the tools

3001
01:40:43,520 --> 01:40:46,400
of science and you're doing that

3002
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:48,319
together

3003
01:40:46,399 --> 01:40:49,679
with like a confidence you probably

3004
01:40:48,319 --> 01:40:51,439
should not have

3005
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:52,639
yeah but you're boldly pushing through

3006
01:40:51,439 --> 01:40:55,198
and then

3007
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:57,279
for him to uh

3008
01:40:55,198 --> 01:41:00,719
to take his own life

3009
01:40:57,279 --> 01:41:02,639
it can ask you about this kind of moment

3010
01:41:00,719 --> 01:41:04,480
that combined

3011
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:08,000
i don't want to say betrayal but perhaps

3012
01:41:04,479 --> 01:41:09,599
the feeling of betrayal that bicep 2

3013
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:11,520
kind of goes on without you even though

3014
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:15,039
you're part of it

3015
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:15,040
you're not part of the leadership group

3016
01:41:15,439 --> 01:41:21,279
can you describe those low points did um

3017
01:41:18,479 --> 01:41:23,678
was there depression was there um

3018
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:26,158
a crumbling of confidence yeah i mean it

3019
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:29,199
was it was so wrapped up

3020
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:31,039
with my identity as a person you know

3021
01:41:29,198 --> 01:41:32,638
like there's only a few different ways

3022
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:34,880
to have identity and you know unless

3023
01:41:32,639 --> 01:41:36,159
you're unhealthy psychologically one of

3024
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:37,679
them for scientists is often that

3025
01:41:36,158 --> 01:41:39,519
they're a scientist and that sometimes

3026
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:41,440
is their primary identity now i've got

3027
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:43,440
other husband and father

3028
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:46,319
um but but you know at that time that

3029
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:48,000
was my identity so to have that kind of

3030
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:50,158
taken away

3031
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,800
it you know what it reminded me of being

3032
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:55,039
you know kind of adopted

3033
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,960
in a sense like my like the one who

3034
01:41:55,039 --> 01:41:58,880
created me or that i had played you know

3035
01:41:56,960 --> 01:42:01,039
played a role in my life that he

3036
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,639
abandoned me in a sense it felt like

3037
01:42:01,039 --> 01:42:04,238
these people are abandoning me and the

3038
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:06,880
only thing i'd correct about the analogy

3039
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:08,319
that you use is like in milit in the war

3040
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:10,159
they're all working you know for common

3041
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:11,439
good it's not like i want to be get the

3042
01:42:10,158 --> 01:42:13,519
most kills

3043
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:15,359
i compare more to like a band like think

3044
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:16,239
about the beatles you know and what they

3045
01:42:15,359 --> 01:42:18,238
did

3046
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:20,238
and then they like you know they ripped

3047
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:22,959
apart because of egos credit they had

3048
01:42:20,238 --> 01:42:24,479
solo careers they had you know

3049
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:26,880
relations their intimates and and so

3050
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:28,799
forth and and there it's not only for

3051
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:31,520
the common good there is more of a

3052
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,920
zero-sum aspect like i would say science

3053
01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:36,480
is not science is an infinite game you

3054
01:42:33,920 --> 01:42:38,239
can't win science you never get today oh

3055
01:42:36,479 --> 01:42:39,599
we won science and even the nobel prize

3056
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:40,638
they don't feel like oh we're done they

3057
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:42,800
feel like a lot of times they're

3058
01:42:40,639 --> 01:42:45,760
imposters even to that day

3059
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:48,239
however science is made up of a lot of

3060
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,480
lot a lot of finite games where there is

3061
01:42:48,238 --> 01:42:52,158
only one winner for tenure there is only

3062
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:53,678
three winners are only three winners for

3063
01:42:52,158 --> 01:42:55,279
the nobel prize

3064
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:57,440
and because of that i think it's

3065
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:59,439
heterodox and it's very confusing

3066
01:42:57,439 --> 01:43:00,799
especially there's no guide i never got

3067
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:02,559
a guide how to be a professor how to

3068
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:05,039
teach how to lead a research group how

3069
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,480
to deal with the death of an advisor how

3070
01:43:05,039 --> 01:43:08,880
to deal with an unreally graduate

3071
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:10,319
student or two you know so we're all

3072
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,239
like reinventing it which is kind of

3073
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:13,920
ironic and insane if you think about it

3074
01:43:12,238 --> 01:43:15,279
because the academic system that i am a

3075
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:18,880
part of and you are a part of is a

3076
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:21,840
thousand years old dates back to bologna

3077
01:43:18,880 --> 01:43:24,159
northern italy 1088 or so first

3078
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:25,600
universities were established

3079
01:43:24,158 --> 01:43:27,279
and you know

3080
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:29,199
very little has changed there's some guy

3081
01:43:27,279 --> 01:43:30,399
or gal scratching a rock on another

3082
01:43:29,198 --> 01:43:31,919
piece of rock

3083
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:33,679
and you know lecturing in front and

3084
01:43:31,920 --> 01:43:35,279
there's only one better aspect nowadays

3085
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:36,960
is that back then

3086
01:43:35,279 --> 01:43:38,880
the students could go on strike if they

3087
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,480
didn't like the professor and then he or

3088
01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,000
she wouldn't get paid probably mostly

3089
01:43:40,479 --> 01:43:43,839
was he's back then

3090
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,960
nowadays that barbaric process has been

3091
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:49,199
replaced by 10 years so i'm okay

3092
01:43:46,960 --> 01:43:51,039
but no it was a definite kind of uh

3093
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:53,039
feeling of the rug getting pulled out

3094
01:43:51,039 --> 01:43:54,560
from underneath me because

3095
01:43:53,039 --> 01:43:56,960
you know here's he was like my

3096
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:59,760
consigliori he was a guy i you know

3097
01:43:56,960 --> 01:44:02,158
sought counsel and counseled me and

3098
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,520
he's dead and i felt like there is no

3099
01:44:02,158 --> 01:44:05,920
one who's gonna honor

3100
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:07,760
the agreements that we had and he was a

3101
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:10,079
very soulful person he was so much

3102
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:11,280
better at being a scientist than i could

3103
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:14,079
ever be

3104
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:16,559
and just a loss for the cosmos it just

3105
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:17,840
really hurt and you know i thought oh

3106
01:44:16,560 --> 01:44:19,679
like you know it's so sad because he

3107
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:21,600
could have won the nobel prize

3108
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:23,199
i don't think like that anymore first i

3109
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:25,280
think about his kids

3110
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:26,799
felt at first now there goes my chance

3111
01:44:25,279 --> 01:44:29,198
at winning a nobel prize and hence the

3112
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,960
title of the book was like i knew i

3113
01:44:29,198 --> 01:44:32,319
would not win the nobel prize

3114
01:44:30,960 --> 01:44:33,760
it also means that there's parts of the

3115
01:44:32,319 --> 01:44:35,519
nobel prize that have to be done away

3116
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:37,440
with it's a double entendre like we need

3117
01:44:35,520 --> 01:44:39,280
to lose aspects of the nobel prize to

3118
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:41,118
help science out we can talk about that

3119
01:44:39,279 --> 01:44:43,198
a different time but

3120
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:44,079
in the context of like now thinking back

3121
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:46,079
on it

3122
01:44:44,079 --> 01:44:47,439
that was such a miniscule part of it

3123
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:49,279
because

3124
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:51,839
let's say he did win the nobel prize or

3125
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:53,519
i did win or you know any of us did

3126
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,920
would that have changed anything without

3127
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:58,639
brought anything back it's so you know

3128
01:44:55,920 --> 01:45:02,158
we say it's like vanity it's futility

3129
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:03,679
and and and i just you know for me the

3130
01:45:02,158 --> 01:45:04,799
nobel prize is like

3131
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:06,800
it's i don't want to say it's like

3132
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,880
insignificant because obviously it has a

3133
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:10,560
lot of power and it has influence and

3134
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,159
you know i went back i had neil degrasse

3135
01:45:10,560 --> 01:45:12,960
tyson on my show i'm going to name drop

3136
01:45:12,158 --> 01:45:16,799
okay

3137
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:19,198
and uh he prepares he prepares like a

3138
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:21,199
surgeon before doing surgery when he

3139
01:45:19,198 --> 01:45:23,359
goes on a talk show so you see him going

3140
01:45:21,198 --> 01:45:25,279
on colbert report you think oh they just

3141
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:26,960
have a banter he's just naturally gifted

3142
01:45:25,279 --> 01:45:29,039
no he said no no no

3143
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:31,198
you say that you're you're undermining

3144
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:33,039
what he does what he does he goes back

3145
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:34,799
he watches the last month of colbert

3146
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:36,800
reports or whatever it's called late

3147
01:45:34,800 --> 01:45:38,480
show and he says how long does steven

3148
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:40,639
pause between questions

3149
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:42,319
how long in the news cycle does he go

3150
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:45,279
back what topics has he talked about

3151
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:47,039
with people similar to me so i took neil

3152
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:48,719
and i did that for you and i look back

3153
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:50,639
how many times does lex mention the

3154
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:53,359
words nobel and prize and i put it into

3155
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:55,600
google engram and out came

3156
01:45:53,359 --> 01:45:57,279
exactly the same number of times as show

3157
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:59,199
notes show

3158
01:45:57,279 --> 01:46:01,118
episodes as of this moment so you've

3159
01:45:59,198 --> 01:46:04,000
said the words nobel prize over 240

3160
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:05,439
times yeah i mean it is so strange as a

3161
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:06,960
symbol

3162
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:09,118
that kind of unites this whole

3163
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,639
scientific journey right

3164
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:13,118
like um

3165
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:15,920
it's so it's both

3166
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:18,719
sad and beautiful that

3167
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:21,039
a little prize like a little award

3168
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:24,719
a medal a little plaque they'll be most

3169
01:46:21,039 --> 01:46:26,639
likely forgotten by history completely

3170
01:46:24,719 --> 01:46:27,600
some silly list

3171
01:46:26,639 --> 01:46:29,440
um

3172
01:46:27,600 --> 01:46:31,039
it's somehow uh

3173
01:46:29,439 --> 01:46:33,279
a catalyst

3174
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:36,238
for greatness it it resulted in you

3175
01:46:33,279 --> 01:46:36,960
doing your life's work yeah the dream of

3176
01:46:36,238 --> 01:46:38,638
it

3177
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:40,880
would i have done it without the nobel

3178
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:42,560
prize you know i i can't necessarily

3179
01:46:40,880 --> 01:46:45,199
counter factually state that that would

3180
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,320
have happened so no it definitely has a

3181
01:46:45,198 --> 01:46:47,359
place

3182
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:49,439
um

3183
01:46:47,359 --> 01:46:51,039
and for me you know it is valuable to

3184
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:53,039
think about it but

3185
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:55,840
the level of obsession that that

3186
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:57,600
academics have about it is really i

3187
01:46:55,840 --> 01:47:00,000
think it is

3188
01:46:57,600 --> 01:47:02,000
almost unbalanced becoming unhealthy

3189
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:04,238
and again i have no

3190
01:47:02,000 --> 01:47:06,079
i make no truck with the uh winners of

3191
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:08,559
the nobel prize obviously i've you know

3192
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:10,719
now i've had 11 on the show and to think

3193
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:11,679
about you know like the one rule so by

3194
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:13,600
the way

3195
01:47:11,679 --> 01:47:15,359
right after the denouement of the story

3196
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:17,440
which i'll get to in a bit um you know

3197
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:18,479
how our dreams went down to dust and

3198
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:20,479
ashes

3199
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:22,000
um i was asked by the royal swedish

3200
01:47:20,479 --> 01:47:24,559
academy of sciences to nominate the

3201
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,719
winners of the 2015 nobel prize in

3202
01:47:24,560 --> 01:47:28,239
physics so like the one that i

3203
01:47:26,719 --> 01:47:31,600
theoretically could have been eligible

3204
01:47:28,238 --> 01:47:33,279
to win uh in in 2016 actually they asked

3205
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:35,600
me to nominate now imagine if i ask you

3206
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:37,679
lex you say brian you know instead of me

3207
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:38,639
inviting myself on the show if if you

3208
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,719
say brian would you like to come on the

3209
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:43,039
lex friedman podcast i think you know

3210
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:44,639
what lex um you know that guy rogan i

3211
01:47:43,039 --> 01:47:46,719
think he might have can you introduce

3212
01:47:44,639 --> 01:47:47,920
him to it to me you know like you

3213
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:49,118
imagine how that would feel like you'd

3214
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:50,880
be like after that you know i'm

3215
01:47:49,118 --> 01:47:52,799
humiliated so i was asked to nominate

3216
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:54,880
the winners and the one rule that they

3217
01:47:52,800 --> 01:47:56,719
say of all the rules that alfred nobel

3218
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:58,400
stipulated there's only one rule that

3219
01:47:56,719 --> 01:48:00,319
they maintained in other words he he

3220
01:47:58,399 --> 01:48:02,879
said one person can win it for something

3221
01:48:00,319 --> 01:48:06,000
they discovered in the preceding year

3222
01:48:02,880 --> 01:48:07,760
that had the greatest benefit to mankind

3223
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:09,359
made the world better right

3224
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:11,199
none of that was mentioned in the letter

3225
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:12,880
it said many people can win it for work

3226
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:14,319
done long ago they didn't mention

3227
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,000
anything in the letter to me signed by

3228
01:48:14,319 --> 01:48:17,439
the secretary general nothing about

3229
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:20,079
benefiting mankind they said just one

3230
01:48:17,439 --> 01:48:21,519
thing can't nominate yourself

3231
01:48:20,079 --> 01:48:23,679
so none of these guys nominated

3232
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:27,920
themselves actually a little known fact

3233
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:30,319
they sent that exact letter just to you

3234
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:33,199
that rule was created just that's called

3235
01:48:30,319 --> 01:48:36,079
the keating correlation yes exactly just

3236
01:48:33,198 --> 01:48:38,719
to like good for them

3237
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:40,319
rub it in that's i mean it's uh in this

3238
01:48:38,719 --> 01:48:42,399
particular case of course there's like

3239
01:48:40,319 --> 01:48:44,158
some weird technicality or whatever but

3240
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:46,158
in this particular case it's kind of a

3241
01:48:44,158 --> 01:48:47,839
powerful

3242
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:50,000
reminder yeah

3243
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:52,480
no the nobel prize leaves a lot of

3244
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:54,880
people behind yeah and there's stories

3245
01:48:52,479 --> 01:48:56,399
behind all of that yeah i mean here's a

3246
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:58,560
good example again this is my friend

3247
01:48:56,399 --> 01:49:00,879
barry barrish he's become like a mentor

3248
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:03,039
and a friend um he wrote the forward to

3249
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:05,520
this uh my book into the about

3250
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:06,960
he um he won the nobel prize because a

3251
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:09,040
different guy died

3252
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,800
and he admits it and he said it and

3253
01:49:09,039 --> 01:49:12,639
actually it's funny with him because

3254
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:14,159
i've heard you talk you know very

3255
01:49:12,639 --> 01:49:16,319
rhapsodically and lovely and

3256
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:18,399
romantically about with harry cliff and

3257
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:19,198
a wonderful podcast with him by the way

3258
01:49:18,399 --> 01:49:21,279
um

3259
01:49:19,198 --> 01:49:23,118
about the lhc and how wonderful it is

3260
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:24,719
and how in that you know we were about

3261
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:27,519
to build this super conducting super

3262
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:28,960
collider right here in texas and it

3263
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:30,159
didn't get built and it got cancelled by

3264
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:31,599
congress

3265
01:49:30,158 --> 01:49:33,039
and i'd say to barry that was the best

3266
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:34,079
thing that ever happened to you and he's

3267
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:35,760
like what the hell are you talking about

3268
01:49:34,079 --> 01:49:37,920
i'm like if that didn't get cancelled

3269
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:39,679
first of all the um

3270
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,760
even though it did get canceled the

3271
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:43,359
europeans went on to build it themselves

3272
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,280
saved the american taxpayers billions of

3273
01:49:43,359 --> 01:49:46,880
dollars and we didn't we wouldn't have

3274
01:49:45,279 --> 01:49:48,960
learned anything really substantially

3275
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:50,960
new as proven by the fact that as you

3276
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:52,800
and harry talked about nothing besides

3277
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,639
the higgs particle of great note has

3278
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:56,639
come out and actually he's had a recent

3279
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:58,239
paper but it's been an upper limit along

3280
01:49:56,639 --> 01:49:59,520
with his collaborators an lhcb

3281
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:01,519
experiment that i'm going to be talking

3282
01:49:59,520 --> 01:50:02,800
with him about but but the bottom line

3283
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:06,080
is it was really built to detect the

3284
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:07,599
higgs so the ssc for twice as much money

3285
01:50:06,079 --> 01:50:09,039
would have sucked up barry's career and

3286
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:10,880
he would have been working on that maybe

3287
01:50:09,039 --> 01:50:12,800
not and then he would never have worked

3288
01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,239
on ligo and then he wouldn't have won

3289
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:15,760
the nobel prize right so you look at

3290
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:17,678
counterfactual history that's not

3291
01:50:15,760 --> 01:50:18,800
actually a big stretch right if the ssc

3292
01:50:17,679 --> 01:50:20,079
had still gone on he would have worked

3293
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:21,840
out because he was one of the primary

3294
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:25,039
leaders of that experiment

3295
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:26,880
second thing if um imagine the following

3296
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:30,319
thing had happened they won the nobel

3297
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:32,400
prize because in september 2015

3298
01:50:30,319 --> 01:50:34,960
they detected unequivocal evidence for

3299
01:50:32,399 --> 01:50:37,118
the in-spiral collision of two massive

3300
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:39,920
black holes each about 30 times the mass

3301
01:50:37,118 --> 01:50:42,639
of the sun leaving behind an object that

3302
01:50:39,920 --> 01:50:45,599
had just less than 60 solar masses

3303
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:47,359
behind so one solar mass worth of matter

3304
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:50,000
goku mask got converted to pure

3305
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:51,039
gravitational energy no light was seen

3306
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,520
by them

3307
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:56,399
this particular date uh september 15th

3308
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:59,040
september 14 2015. okay

3309
01:50:56,399 --> 01:51:01,039
um that explosion because of the miracle

3310
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:02,719
of time travel that telescopes afford us

3311
01:51:01,039 --> 01:51:06,719
that actually took place

3312
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:07,840
uh 1.2 billion years ago in a galaxy far

3313
01:51:06,719 --> 01:51:09,359
far away they actually don't know which

3314
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:11,119
galaxy took place and still then they

3315
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:13,279
never will okay

3316
01:51:11,118 --> 01:51:14,559
that if that collision between these two

3317
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:16,719
things which have probably been orbiting

3318
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:19,119
each other for maybe a million years or

3319
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:20,880
more if that had occurred 15 days

3320
01:51:19,118 --> 01:51:22,559
earlier barry wouldn't have won the

3321
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:24,960
nobel prize

3322
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,639
because it's hilarious to think that

3323
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:29,679
there's one human that won the nobel

3324
01:51:26,639 --> 01:51:31,118
prize because uh two giant things

3325
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:34,319
collided

3326
01:51:31,118 --> 01:51:36,559
a billion 200 million years ago and if

3327
01:51:34,319 --> 01:51:39,039
it happened eight you know 18 days 20

3328
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:40,880
days 30 because that was the deadline

3329
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:43,198
for the nobel prize to be announced they

3330
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:44,719
announced the findings in february but

3331
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:46,638
you have to nominate the winners in

3332
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:48,639
january so i could have nominated them

3333
01:51:46,639 --> 01:51:50,159
up until january 30th but they didn't

3334
01:51:48,639 --> 01:51:53,279
announce anything and there were just

3335
01:51:50,158 --> 01:51:54,479
rumors and so they he didn't he but the

3336
01:51:53,279 --> 01:51:55,599
reason that he wouldn't have won it

3337
01:51:54,479 --> 01:51:57,759
because there was another guy who was

3338
01:51:55,599 --> 01:51:59,920
still alive considered to be the founder

3339
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:01,840
and father of three of the three fathers

3340
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:03,440
ray weiss who did win it kip thorne who

3341
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:06,319
did win it and the third gentleman at

3342
01:52:03,439 --> 01:52:08,960
caltech named ron drever who passed away

3343
01:52:06,319 --> 01:52:11,279
again he was alive in 2016. he died in

3344
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:14,000
the middle of 2017 and then he wasn't

3345
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:17,118
awarded the nobel prize and here we are

3346
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:19,279
several billion of hairless apes that

3347
01:52:17,118 --> 01:52:22,238
strangely wear clothing

3348
01:52:19,279 --> 01:52:25,279
uh celebrated uh three

3349
01:52:22,238 --> 01:52:26,799
other clothed hairless apes

3350
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:28,238
with a metal

3351
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,480
with one

3352
01:52:28,238 --> 01:52:32,879
with one particular element

3353
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:34,799
and then uh they made speeches in a

3354
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:36,000
particular language that evolved you

3355
01:52:34,800 --> 01:52:37,840
know

3356
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,639
to get those medals in front of another

3357
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:40,960
guy

3358
01:52:38,639 --> 01:52:43,599
who wears even fancier clothes who is

3359
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:45,439
the king of sweden and then they got

3360
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:46,960
some free food afterwards some reindeer

3361
01:52:45,439 --> 01:52:49,678
meat that's right

3362
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:51,359
okay excellent um

3363
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:52,960
since you mentioned joe rogan in that

3364
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:55,439
little example uh

3365
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:56,960
what happened to you in terms of bicep

3366
01:52:55,439 --> 01:53:00,000
too

3367
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:01,840
i want to kind of speak um

3368
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:04,079
at a high level about a particular thing

3369
01:53:01,840 --> 01:53:06,000
i observed so i was a fan of joe rogan

3370
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:07,519
uh since he started the podcast just

3371
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:10,560
listening to the podcast i'm a huge fan

3372
01:53:07,520 --> 01:53:14,159
of podcasts in general yeah and

3373
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:16,560
it also coincided with my entry into

3374
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:19,439
grad school and this whole journey of

3375
01:53:16,560 --> 01:53:21,520
academia so grad school getting my phd

3376
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:22,719
and going to mit and then google and

3377
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:26,480
then just

3378
01:53:22,719 --> 01:53:27,599
looking at this whole world of research

3379
01:53:26,479 --> 01:53:30,238
what i

3380
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:33,520
really loved about

3381
01:53:30,238 --> 01:53:36,079
how joe rogan approaches the world

3382
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:38,159
is that he celebrates others

3383
01:53:36,079 --> 01:53:40,880
like he promotes them he gets like

3384
01:53:38,158 --> 01:53:43,920
genuinely and i now know this from just

3385
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:47,599
being a friend privately he genuinely

3386
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:48,480
gets excited by the success of others

3387
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:50,719
and

3388
01:53:48,479 --> 01:53:52,000
the contrast of that

3389
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:54,480
to how

3390
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:56,719
folks in academia often behave was

3391
01:53:54,479 --> 01:53:58,959
always really disappointing to me

3392
01:53:56,719 --> 01:54:00,719
because the natural just on a basic

3393
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:02,239
human level

3394
01:54:00,719 --> 01:54:04,239
there is

3395
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:06,238
an excitement but the nature of that

3396
01:54:04,238 --> 01:54:08,479
excitement is more like

3397
01:54:06,238 --> 01:54:10,399
i'm happy for my friend

3398
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:12,158
but i'm really jealous and i want to

3399
01:54:10,399 --> 01:54:14,238
even outdo them i want to celebrate them

3400
01:54:12,158 --> 01:54:16,399
but i want to do even better so even

3401
01:54:14,238 --> 01:54:19,839
that's even for friends yeah so there's

3402
01:54:16,399 --> 01:54:22,879
not a genuine pure excitement

3403
01:54:19,840 --> 01:54:26,159
for others and then uh to couple that

3404
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:28,079
with just the you now as a as a host of

3405
01:54:26,158 --> 01:54:30,559
a popular podcast know this feeling

3406
01:54:28,079 --> 01:54:33,118
which is like there's not even a

3407
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:35,199
willingness to celebrate publicly

3408
01:54:33,118 --> 01:54:37,198
the awesomeness of others

3409
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:37,919
people in academia

3410
01:54:37,198 --> 01:54:39,919
are

3411
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:42,319
often best equipped

3412
01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:44,158
technically in terms of language to

3413
01:54:42,319 --> 01:54:45,359
celebrate others they understand the

3414
01:54:44,158 --> 01:54:46,638
beauty

3415
01:54:45,359 --> 01:54:49,359
like the

3416
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:51,520
the full richness of why the the cool

3417
01:54:49,359 --> 01:54:53,359
idea is as cool as it is and they're in

3418
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,800
the best position to celebrate it and

3419
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:56,000
yet there's a feeling that if i

3420
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:58,480
celebrate

3421
01:54:56,000 --> 01:55:01,439
others they might end up on the cover of

3422
01:54:58,479 --> 01:55:03,118
nature whatever and not me

3423
01:55:01,439 --> 01:55:05,439
it's they turn it into zero-sum game

3424
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:06,880
what i the reason why

3425
01:55:05,439 --> 01:55:08,479
i think uh

3426
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,719
rogan has been inspiration to me and

3427
01:55:08,479 --> 01:55:13,439
many others is that it doesn't have to

3428
01:55:10,719 --> 01:55:15,118
be that yeah and and forget money and

3429
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:17,359
all those kinds of things that

3430
01:55:15,118 --> 01:55:18,559
i think there's a narrative told

3431
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:20,719
that

3432
01:55:18,560 --> 01:55:22,639
academics are this way

3433
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:24,639
because there's a limited amount of

3434
01:55:22,639 --> 01:55:25,440
money and so they're fighting for this i

3435
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:26,239
don't

3436
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:27,839
think

3437
01:55:26,238 --> 01:55:29,678
that's the reason it's happening this

3438
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:30,880
way i think

3439
01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:32,800
i think you

3440
01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:34,800
you can have a limited amount of money

3441
01:55:32,800 --> 01:55:37,039
the battle for money

3442
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:39,279
happens in the space of proposal there's

3443
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:42,079
networking there's private stuff

3444
01:55:39,279 --> 01:55:44,079
public celebration of others and all and

3445
01:55:42,079 --> 01:55:47,118
just actually just how you feel in the

3446
01:55:44,079 --> 01:55:49,679
privacy of your own heart is not have to

3447
01:55:47,118 --> 01:55:52,158
do anything with money it has to

3448
01:55:49,679 --> 01:55:54,560
do with you having a big ego not

3449
01:55:52,158 --> 01:55:56,799
humbling yourself to the beauty of the

3450
01:55:54,560 --> 01:56:00,080
journey that we are all on and there's

3451
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:02,560
folks like joe rogan who in the comedian

3452
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:04,880
circles is also rare but he inspired all

3453
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,480
these other comedians to realize

3454
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:08,400
you know what it's great to celebrate

3455
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:10,718
each other we're promoting each other

3456
01:56:08,399 --> 01:56:12,238
and therefore the pie grows yeah because

3457
01:56:10,719 --> 01:56:14,639
everybody else gets excited about this

3458
01:56:12,238 --> 01:56:17,279
whole thing and the pie grows right now

3459
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:19,199
the scientists by fighting like by not

3460
01:56:17,279 --> 01:56:21,198
celebrating each other are not growing

3461
01:56:19,198 --> 01:56:23,039
the pie and now

3462
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:24,559
because of that sort of science becomes

3463
01:56:23,039 --> 01:56:26,319
less and less positive

3464
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:28,480
and exactly no and i want to point out

3465
01:56:26,319 --> 01:56:30,319
two things one is that i remember you

3466
01:56:28,479 --> 01:56:33,279
went on joe's show maybe a couple of

3467
01:56:30,319 --> 01:56:34,238
years ago and um and then he gave you a

3468
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:36,238
watch

3469
01:56:34,238 --> 01:56:38,399
he gave you like a rolex right yeah and

3470
01:56:36,238 --> 01:56:40,879
i tweeted to you and i think mega omega

3471
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:43,279
sorry okay fine uh the watch that went

3472
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:45,440
to the to the moon which we will get to

3473
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:47,439
in a bit um i don't think he could give

3474
01:56:45,439 --> 01:56:49,279
you what i gave you though by the way um

3475
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:51,359
and we'll get to what that final gift

3476
01:56:49,279 --> 01:56:53,359
package is for you and by the way i also

3477
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:55,759
wanted to mention because when you said

3478
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:57,679
joe i would not be upset and you should

3479
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,520
definitely go on joe rogan and i we had

3480
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:01,118
this conversation with him yeah

3481
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:02,560
because i was like when i was

3482
01:57:01,118 --> 01:57:05,118
uh

3483
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:06,480
uh so moving to austin

3484
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:08,238
and i had a conversation like don't you

3485
01:57:06,479 --> 01:57:10,158
think it's weird like if we have the

3486
01:57:08,238 --> 01:57:11,198
same guests at the same time or whatever

3487
01:57:10,158 --> 01:57:12,559
he's like

3488
01:57:11,198 --> 01:57:14,479
that

3489
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:18,480
i want you to be more successful than me

3490
01:57:14,479 --> 01:57:20,079
i want he he truly wants everybody like

3491
01:57:18,479 --> 01:57:22,079
especially people close to him to be

3492
01:57:20,079 --> 01:57:24,079
more successful like there's not even a

3493
01:57:22,079 --> 01:57:25,279
thought like but you know why he does

3494
01:57:24,079 --> 01:57:26,719
and this is what i tweeted to you and

3495
01:57:25,279 --> 01:57:28,800
one of the few things i think you have

3496
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:30,880
retweeted that i sent you i said someday

3497
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:34,719
you're going to give that to somebody

3498
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:34,719
and today i wanted that to be me no no

3499
01:57:35,520 --> 01:57:40,159
joe's omega no but but the point is he

3500
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:42,158
sees in you that same um you know

3501
01:57:40,158 --> 01:57:43,679
grandiosity that same genuine spirit

3502
01:57:42,158 --> 01:57:45,359
graciousness and i think that's true i

3503
01:57:43,679 --> 01:57:46,719
mean you do do something very rare i

3504
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:48,639
don't turn this into too much of a love

3505
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:50,719
fest but i do want to say even back to

3506
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:52,800
andrew you know who i've almost been

3507
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:54,639
hate hagiographic about you know just

3508
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:56,880
treating him like a saint he said to me

3509
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:57,840
the same thing and a moment of peak

3510
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:00,000
said like

3511
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:02,319
god damn it like i have to train these

3512
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,238
guys and women that work for me

3513
01:58:02,319 --> 01:58:06,158
so that they can be better than me so

3514
01:58:04,238 --> 01:58:07,678
that they can go out and compete with me

3515
01:58:06,158 --> 01:58:09,759
for the same limited amount of funding

3516
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:12,239
from the effing nsl you know

3517
01:58:09,760 --> 01:58:14,480
that wasn't his that wasn't who he was

3518
01:58:12,238 --> 01:58:16,238
um that was just an expression like i'm

3519
01:58:14,479 --> 01:58:18,079
doing something which is fundamentally

3520
01:58:16,238 --> 01:58:19,519
but you know what um

3521
01:58:18,079 --> 01:58:21,039
when you have kids hopefully you know

3522
01:58:19,520 --> 01:58:22,560
please god you will someday because i

3523
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:23,920
think and i hope we can get to talk

3524
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:24,960
about that later but

3525
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:27,359
part of

3526
01:58:24,960 --> 01:58:28,800
investment and part of doing something

3527
01:58:27,359 --> 01:58:30,238
with when you have a kid like you can

3528
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:32,079
get married

3529
01:58:30,238 --> 01:58:34,079
you can marry someone because she's rich

3530
01:58:32,079 --> 01:58:35,279
or he's rich you can marry someone

3531
01:58:34,079 --> 01:58:36,158
because they're good looking or he's

3532
01:58:35,279 --> 01:58:37,519
good look

3533
01:58:36,158 --> 01:58:39,759
you can marry for all these different

3534
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:41,119
reasons that are ultimately selfish

3535
01:58:39,760 --> 01:58:42,800
there's no way you can have a kid and be

3536
01:58:41,118 --> 01:58:44,158
selfish nobody says like oh you know

3537
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:45,440
what i really want this thing that's

3538
01:58:44,158 --> 01:58:47,279
three feet tall that doesn't speak

3539
01:58:45,439 --> 01:58:48,479
english it craps on my floor that wakes

3540
01:58:47,279 --> 01:58:50,319
me up all hours of the night that

3541
01:58:48,479 --> 01:58:52,079
interferes my love life you know nobody

3542
01:58:50,319 --> 01:58:53,679
says that because it doesn't benefit you

3543
01:58:52,079 --> 01:58:55,198
for months and months a friend of mine

3544
01:58:53,679 --> 01:58:57,440
who actually does the videos for me that

3545
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:59,198
does a lot of my solo videos he's having

3546
01:58:57,439 --> 01:59:00,719
his first kid he's like what do i do

3547
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:02,559
because it always gets stupid i'll catch

3548
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:04,480
up on sleep now like yeah i'm gonna

3549
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:05,679
store sleep in my sleep bank like i

3550
01:59:04,479 --> 01:59:07,118
don't think huberman and you talked

3551
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:09,039
about that right you can't do that

3552
01:59:07,118 --> 01:59:11,198
that's stupid what you can do give the

3553
01:59:09,039 --> 01:59:13,920
kid a bath feed the baby let the mother

3554
01:59:11,198 --> 01:59:15,519
relax like in other words do the things

3555
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,760
and and this really relates back to

3556
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:19,679
aristotle once aristotle said why do

3557
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,719
parents love kids more than kids love

3558
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:21,760
parents

3559
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:22,560
as much as you love your dad and your

3560
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,480
mom

3561
01:59:22,560 --> 01:59:26,159
they still love you more

3562
01:59:24,479 --> 01:59:28,319
and because you love that what you

3563
01:59:26,158 --> 01:59:29,920
sacrifice for here's a proof

3564
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:31,679
um i know a lot of families that have

3565
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:34,319
kids with special needs some some with

3566
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:36,000
severe uh my one of my uncles um the

3567
01:59:34,319 --> 01:59:37,519
keating side had uh severe what they

3568
01:59:36,000 --> 01:59:40,079
called mental retardation now it's

3569
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:41,920
probably has a different name

3570
01:59:40,079 --> 01:59:44,319
that out of the nine other brothers and

3571
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:46,719
sisters he was their favorite because

3572
01:59:44,319 --> 01:59:48,399
they had to sacrifice so much for him

3573
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:50,560
and i think of that you know in the

3574
01:59:48,399 --> 01:59:51,519
small case like joe is kind of mentoring

3575
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:52,960
you or whatever you're going to mentor

3576
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:55,760
someone you love that which you

3577
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:58,158
sacrifice for sacrifice is reduction of

3578
01:59:55,760 --> 02:00:00,400
entropy it's storing and investing and

3579
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:02,399
you want to protect that and you know

3580
02:00:00,399 --> 02:00:03,759
that that to me really speaks to it so i

3581
02:00:02,399 --> 02:00:06,158
you know i don't hold it against but it

3582
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:07,760
is true like scientists are you know

3583
02:00:06,158 --> 02:00:09,118
when they're described again they're

3584
02:00:07,760 --> 02:00:10,159
often said to be like children right

3585
02:00:09,118 --> 02:00:11,359
you've heard this description they're

3586
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:13,198
inquisitive they're curious they're

3587
02:00:11,359 --> 02:00:14,158
passionate they love that i'm like yeah

3588
02:00:13,198 --> 02:00:15,118
and they don't play well with others

3589
02:00:14,158 --> 02:00:16,399
they're jealous they're petty they're

3590
02:00:15,118 --> 02:00:18,238
selfish they won't share their ball and

3591
02:00:16,399 --> 02:00:19,759
go home yeah we you can't there's no

3592
02:00:18,238 --> 02:00:21,039
such thing as a single-edged sword i

3593
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,560
wish there were

3594
02:00:21,039 --> 02:00:23,840
you know because you we we need some

3595
02:00:22,560 --> 02:00:27,679
more of that because you gotta dull it

3596
02:00:23,840 --> 02:00:29,840
up but in this case he uh you know i i

3597
02:00:27,679 --> 02:00:32,158
think when when you have this

3598
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:34,000
kind of investment in in science it's

3599
02:00:32,158 --> 02:00:35,598
going to be natural but that doesn't

3600
02:00:34,000 --> 02:00:38,158
mean we have to like you know feed the

3601
02:00:35,599 --> 02:00:39,599
flames of competition you know i'm like

3602
02:00:38,158 --> 02:00:42,079
really vendor if you go to the homepage

3603
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:43,920
of the nsf or the department of energy

3604
02:00:42,079 --> 02:00:46,319
or the recently released national

3605
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,279
academy of sciences future of science

3606
02:00:46,319 --> 02:00:49,519
for the

3607
02:00:47,279 --> 02:00:51,519
astronomical sciences for the next 25

3608
02:00:49,520 --> 02:00:53,040
years or more they talk about how many

3609
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:55,760
nobel prizes these different science

3610
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:57,840
things could win exoplanets life uh the

3611
02:00:55,760 --> 02:01:01,039
discovery of the cmb b mode polarization

3612
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:02,560
then i study you know that's figured too

3613
02:01:01,039 --> 02:01:04,479
in this thing and i'm like what message

3614
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:06,320
is that sent to kids like to young

3615
02:01:04,479 --> 02:01:07,678
people like that's what you should be

3616
02:01:06,319 --> 02:01:09,519
doing so you win this small as you said

3617
02:01:07,679 --> 02:01:11,199
this prize given out by one hairless ape

3618
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:12,560
to another wearing a fancier costume and

3619
02:01:11,198 --> 02:01:14,719
using reindeer in the case of nobel

3620
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:16,719
prize it's only currently given to three

3621
02:01:14,719 --> 02:01:18,239
people at most which was never one of

3622
02:01:16,719 --> 02:01:19,920
his stipulate he actually said one you

3623
02:01:18,238 --> 02:01:21,519
could only give it to one person so they

3624
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:23,118
change it why do they change it i talk

3625
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:24,800
about speculating by the way the book's

3626
02:01:23,118 --> 02:01:27,279
only three chapters out of 11 about the

3627
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,400
nobel prize and it's its effect

3628
02:01:27,279 --> 02:01:31,118
but you know one of the things that's

3629
02:01:28,399 --> 02:01:33,198
been so interesting like um speaking

3630
02:01:31,118 --> 02:01:35,118
actually this coming up in december is

3631
02:01:33,198 --> 02:01:37,359
that the nobel prize is given out on the

3632
02:01:35,118 --> 02:01:39,118
day of alfred nobel's death

3633
02:01:37,359 --> 02:01:41,279
there's a lot of and and and they bring

3634
02:01:39,118 --> 02:01:43,799
in flowers not from his birthplace but

3635
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:46,800
from his mausoleum which is in san

3636
02:01:43,800 --> 02:01:48,800
marino mourinho in italy

3637
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:50,239
uh it's a lot of like death fascination

3638
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:52,000
you know denial of death features

3639
02:01:50,238 --> 02:01:54,559
heavily in the nobel prize because it's

3640
02:01:52,000 --> 02:01:56,238
like what outlives a person well science

3641
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:57,920
cannot live a person my father has a

3642
02:01:56,238 --> 02:02:00,079
theorem named after him it's still you

3643
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:02,079
know in you know engraved in many places

3644
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:03,198
around the world you or i we can go to

3645
02:02:02,079 --> 02:02:04,238
different places around the world people

3646
02:02:03,198 --> 02:02:06,399
know who we are based on our

3647
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:07,759
publications we engrave things we want

3648
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:09,519
to store things we want to compress

3649
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:10,880
things and i think that's there's

3650
02:02:09,520 --> 02:02:12,639
something beautiful about that but there

3651
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:14,319
is a notion of denial of death like

3652
02:02:12,639 --> 02:02:15,118
there is a notion of what will outlast

3653
02:02:14,319 --> 02:02:17,439
me

3654
02:02:15,118 --> 02:02:18,799
especially if you're among the many 90

3655
02:02:17,439 --> 02:02:20,238
something percent of members of the

3656
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:21,279
national academy don't believe in an

3657
02:02:20,238 --> 02:02:24,879
active

3658
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:27,599
faith you know and a creator and a god

3659
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:30,000
and um and science can substitute for

3660
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:32,480
that but it's not it's not ultimately as

3661
02:02:30,000 --> 02:02:34,238
fulfilling i just i don't believe it can

3662
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:36,638
fulfill a person the way

3663
02:02:34,238 --> 02:02:39,198
even practicing but not believing in a

3664
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:41,199
religion can fulfill a person

3665
02:02:39,198 --> 02:02:43,039
so it which is interesting because you

3666
02:02:41,198 --> 02:02:44,158
do bring up ernest becker in the denial

3667
02:02:43,039 --> 02:02:46,560
of death

3668
02:02:44,158 --> 02:02:49,198
in losing the nobel prize book

3669
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:52,639
and there is a sense in which

3670
02:02:49,198 --> 02:02:54,319
that's probably in part at the core

3671
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:56,960
of this especially later dream of the

3672
02:02:54,319 --> 02:03:00,960
nobel prize or a prize or recognition

3673
02:02:56,960 --> 02:03:02,719
i've interacted with a few um you know a

3674
02:03:00,960 --> 02:03:04,399
large number of scientists that are

3675
02:03:02,719 --> 02:03:07,679
getting up in age

3676
02:03:04,399 --> 02:03:11,598
and there is the feeling of real pride

3677
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:15,199
of happiness in them from winning

3678
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:17,039
awards and getting certain recognitions

3679
02:03:15,198 --> 02:03:19,118
and i probably at the core of that is a

3680
02:03:17,039 --> 02:03:21,039
kind of immortality or

3681
02:03:19,118 --> 02:03:24,479
um

3682
02:03:21,039 --> 02:03:26,560
a kind of desire for immortality

3683
02:03:24,479 --> 02:03:27,759
and that that was always off-putting to

3684
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:30,400
me

3685
02:03:27,760 --> 02:03:32,239
as opposed to i mean i know

3686
02:03:30,399 --> 02:03:33,198
it sounds weird to say it's off-putting

3687
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:35,519
but

3688
02:03:33,198 --> 02:03:38,719
it's just

3689
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:40,880
rather than celebrating the pure joy of

3690
02:03:38,719 --> 02:03:42,560
uh

3691
02:03:40,880 --> 02:03:45,279
solving

3692
02:03:42,560 --> 02:03:48,480
the puzzles of the mysteries all around

3693
02:03:45,279 --> 02:03:51,759
us just the the the actual

3694
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:53,678
the actual uh exploration

3695
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:56,000
uh of the mysterious

3696
02:03:53,679 --> 02:03:57,679
sounds for its own sake yeah well that's

3697
02:03:56,000 --> 02:03:59,279
what i said you know it's like

3698
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:00,800
a scientist should okay you have to be

3699
02:03:59,279 --> 02:04:03,279
careful and not have any you know

3700
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:05,360
physical it has to be platonic but

3701
02:04:03,279 --> 02:04:07,118
you can think of of scientists and

3702
02:04:05,359 --> 02:04:08,960
mentor i have a chart in the book and

3703
02:04:07,118 --> 02:04:10,238
then a plaque made by one of my graduate

3704
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:11,439
students former graduate students she's

3705
02:04:10,238 --> 02:04:14,078
now a professor

3706
02:04:11,439 --> 02:04:16,559
in new mexico darcy baron and she made

3707
02:04:14,078 --> 02:04:19,039
this plot and it has 17 generations so

3708
02:04:16,560 --> 02:04:20,800
here i am 17 you know levels down

3709
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:23,519
there's a guy labnets not the famous

3710
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:25,679
labness different live nuts 1596 he was

3711
02:04:23,520 --> 02:04:27,599
born and i'm in this chain

3712
02:04:25,679 --> 02:04:29,520
and i don't know if you know this but in

3713
02:04:27,599 --> 02:04:31,840
the russian language the word scientist

3714
02:04:29,520 --> 02:04:33,760
means someone who was taught i'll say it

3715
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:36,159
very slowly one who was taught right

3716
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:38,719
which only hachoni so um it probably

3717
02:04:36,158 --> 02:04:39,679
means like i was taught right no i could

3718
02:04:38,719 --> 02:04:42,078
just just speak

3719
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:43,920
no no it's some it's it's literally

3720
02:04:42,078 --> 02:04:45,920
someone someone who is taught right so

3721
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:47,440
what does that mean to me it has a dual

3722
02:04:45,920 --> 02:04:48,639
kind of meaning at least dual meaning

3723
02:04:47,439 --> 02:04:49,678
one is that you have to be a good

3724
02:04:48,639 --> 02:04:51,039
student

3725
02:04:49,679 --> 02:04:52,480
to be a scientist because you have to

3726
02:04:51,039 --> 02:04:53,840
learn from somebody else

3727
02:04:52,479 --> 02:04:55,118
two you have to be a teacher you have to

3728
02:04:53,840 --> 02:04:57,840
pay it forward

3729
02:04:55,118 --> 02:05:00,000
if you don't i claim you're really not a

3730
02:04:57,840 --> 02:05:01,520
scientist in the truest sense

3731
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,279
and i feel like with the work that i do

3732
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:04,880
in outreach and stuff like that i'm

3733
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:06,960
doing it at scale i'm influencing more

3734
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,560
than eight you know 24 kids i might have

3735
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:10,800
in my graduate class or undergraduate

3736
02:05:08,560 --> 02:05:13,039
class and they potentially could reach

3737
02:05:10,800 --> 02:05:15,840
thousands of people around the world

3738
02:05:13,039 --> 02:05:17,920
and make them into scientists themselves

3739
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:20,319
because that's the flywheel that is only

3740
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:23,039
beneficial there is no competition there

3741
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:25,439
is no zero sum fixed a fixed mindset

3742
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:28,078
versus growth mindset um because it is

3743
02:05:25,439 --> 02:05:29,279
an infinite game imagine a culture that

3744
02:05:28,078 --> 02:05:31,039
had none of the trappings of the

3745
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:33,279
negativity of the soviet union or

3746
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:35,679
pre-world war one uh

3747
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:38,479
germany or imperial japan you know

3748
02:05:35,679 --> 02:05:40,719
science celebrated and we're just making

3749
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:41,678
like a nation of scientists and like

3750
02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:43,679
we're not doing it to become

3751
02:05:41,679 --> 02:05:45,039
multi-billionaires or necessarily you

3752
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:47,279
know for any

3753
02:05:45,039 --> 02:05:48,800
military purpose whatsoever but if we

3754
02:05:47,279 --> 02:05:50,639
had that you know sometimes i'm flying

3755
02:05:48,800 --> 02:05:51,840
you know home at night like when you fly

3756
02:05:50,639 --> 02:05:53,359
into la

3757
02:05:51,840 --> 02:05:55,119
you literally it's very rare you can see

3758
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:57,118
like the number 10 million like it's

3759
02:05:55,118 --> 02:05:58,479
very hard to like visualize things you

3760
02:05:57,118 --> 02:05:59,920
see a brick wall you ask how many bricks

3761
02:05:58,479 --> 02:06:02,078
are there there might be a thousand two

3762
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:04,158
thousand ten million lights there's 10

3763
02:06:02,078 --> 02:06:05,359
million souls and you can see and

3764
02:06:04,158 --> 02:06:07,279
they're discreet they're not like the

3765
02:06:05,359 --> 02:06:10,960
milky way all blending together each

3766
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:13,039
lost in their own busy lives excited

3767
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:14,639
fall in love afraid of losing their job

3768
02:06:13,039 --> 02:06:16,719
all that by the way people should know

3769
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:18,800
that you're a pilot so you literally

3770
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:20,880
mean fly yeah sometimes they get to do

3771
02:06:18,800 --> 02:06:23,279
it you get to look at the

3772
02:06:20,880 --> 02:06:26,159
the the eye of god perspective on these

3773
02:06:23,279 --> 02:06:27,279
uh 10 million and these millions of

3774
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:29,359
and i have this age they're like

3775
02:06:27,279 --> 02:06:30,960
constellations but upside down like the

3776
02:06:29,359 --> 02:06:32,238
city this is like a constant hopefully

3777
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:33,840
i'll stay keep the plane the right way

3778
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:36,000
up but when you think about that like

3779
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:37,440
imagine they're all working together

3780
02:06:36,000 --> 02:06:39,359
and imagine like you always talk about

3781
02:06:37,439 --> 02:06:40,719
love and but like

3782
02:06:39,359 --> 02:06:42,238
you don't know you don't know that

3783
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:43,439
they're not worthy of love like so

3784
02:06:42,238 --> 02:06:45,598
you're looking down on them and it's

3785
02:06:43,439 --> 02:06:48,238
just amazing because you think like what

3786
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:50,480
an amazing creation is man and humans

3787
02:06:48,238 --> 02:06:53,039
and what can we do it's it's phenomenal

3788
02:06:50,479 --> 02:06:54,559
it's so exciting and then i get to do it

3789
02:06:53,039 --> 02:06:56,000
you know it's a job i say don't tell

3790
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:56,639
gavin newsom but i do it for free you

3791
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:58,560
know

3792
02:06:56,639 --> 02:07:00,480
i love what i do and

3793
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:02,960
but to think about like oh if my student

3794
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:04,959
succeeds that i'm not no it's it's

3795
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:05,920
it it is unfortunate that you have

3796
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:08,000
experienced that i've certainly

3797
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:10,078
experienced it and i think there are

3798
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:12,880
ways around it i think it is it is a

3799
02:07:10,078 --> 02:07:14,960
vexing problem because people want to

3800
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:17,840
you know it's very tempting to keep your

3801
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:19,039
own kind of you know garden fertilized

3802
02:07:17,840 --> 02:07:20,560
you know one thing that's interesting is

3803
02:07:19,039 --> 02:07:22,560
like you know people like why are you

3804
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:23,760
doing this thing and a podcast you're

3805
02:07:22,560 --> 02:07:25,840
supposed to be a you know serious

3806
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,599
scientist leading this huge project and

3807
02:07:25,840 --> 02:07:29,679
um collaborators and

3808
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:31,119
and i'm like well most of what i do as i

3809
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,440
said before it's yeah for you it's

3810
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:35,279
velcro for me it's like you know

3811
02:07:33,439 --> 02:07:36,879
what is the deal with the with the

3812
02:07:35,279 --> 02:07:38,479
safety standards on the truck that we're

3813
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:39,840
driving up to deliver the diesel fuel

3814
02:07:38,479 --> 02:07:41,678
that will power the generator that allow

3815
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:43,199
the concrete truck to it has nothing to

3816
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:45,359
do with the big bang inflation the

3817
02:07:43,198 --> 02:07:46,479
multiverse god's existence has nothing

3818
02:07:45,359 --> 02:07:48,399
to do with that right so those are

3819
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:49,759
people i say i have to talk to

3820
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:51,279
the people that come on the show those

3821
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:53,440
are people i want to talk to

3822
02:07:51,279 --> 02:07:55,759
and that's super fun i mean it's it's a

3823
02:07:53,439 --> 02:07:57,598
real honor that i get to do it i'm using

3824
02:07:55,760 --> 02:07:59,119
i have some unfair advantages right i'm

3825
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:00,239
at a top university we have people

3826
02:07:59,118 --> 02:08:01,679
that's affiliated with the arthur c

3827
02:08:00,238 --> 02:08:03,118
clarke foundation

3828
02:08:01,679 --> 02:08:05,359
you know brilliant scientists coming

3829
02:08:03,118 --> 02:08:08,158
through and but i felt like it would be

3830
02:08:05,359 --> 02:08:09,839
kind of a a shame if i didn't you know

3831
02:08:08,158 --> 02:08:11,759
allow them to teach at scale because

3832
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:14,239
they're better teachers than i am

3833
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:16,480
let me ask you a

3834
02:08:14,238 --> 02:08:19,198
interesting maybe difficult question

3835
02:08:16,479 --> 02:08:21,198
have you ever considered talking

3836
02:08:19,198 --> 02:08:23,118
on your podcast

3837
02:08:21,198 --> 02:08:26,158
with the people who would get the nobel

3838
02:08:23,118 --> 02:08:28,078
prize for bicep 2 if it turned out to be

3839
02:08:26,158 --> 02:08:29,679
detecting what it is

3840
02:08:28,078 --> 02:08:31,920
yeah i mean i'm still i'm still friends

3841
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:33,359
with them and they have still gone on to

3842
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:35,440
so i should we should say like why we

3843
02:08:33,359 --> 02:08:38,238
didn't win the nobel prize and then

3844
02:08:35,439 --> 02:08:40,000
what happened with the group that is now

3845
02:08:38,238 --> 02:08:42,158
leading it completely

3846
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:44,479
that i'm completely divorced from in a

3847
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:46,158
secular sense uh we're friends you know

3848
02:08:44,479 --> 02:08:48,078
we we see each other you know we send

3849
02:08:46,158 --> 02:08:50,238
each other emails and stuff like that

3850
02:08:48,078 --> 02:08:52,799
i'd love to get their sense of like what

3851
02:08:50,238 --> 02:08:54,158
the the natural heartbreak built into

3852
02:08:52,800 --> 02:08:56,079
the whole process

3853
02:08:54,158 --> 02:08:58,158
of the nobel prize what their sense is i

3854
02:08:56,078 --> 02:08:59,840
would love to hear yeah an honest real

3855
02:08:58,158 --> 02:09:01,839
conversation i understand your friends

3856
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:04,078
yeah yeah there's some hard truth that

3857
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:05,840
even friends will talk they weren't

3858
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:07,359
i mean i remember one of them you know

3859
02:09:05,840 --> 02:09:09,199
was like well what's this i hear about a

3860
02:09:07,359 --> 02:09:10,639
book and i mean a lot of people tell me

3861
02:09:09,198 --> 02:09:12,158
not to write the book they said it's

3862
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:13,359
going to give you know too much

3863
02:09:12,158 --> 02:09:15,039
attention to the nobel prize it's going

3864
02:09:13,359 --> 02:09:17,039
to look like sour grapes

3865
02:09:15,039 --> 02:09:18,479
again i say you can prove i have sour

3866
02:09:17,039 --> 02:09:20,639
grapes or not just give me the next

3867
02:09:18,479 --> 02:09:22,000
prize no uh so you would if you get a

3868
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:24,000
nobel prize for literature you would

3869
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,920
turn it down i don't know

3870
02:09:24,000 --> 02:09:28,639
it's funny because sabine hassenfelder

3871
02:09:25,920 --> 02:09:30,960
uh who is uh who's a fellow kind of

3872
02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:33,199
youtube sensation and uh

3873
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:35,198
she's shoeing for the nobel peace prize

3874
02:09:33,198 --> 02:09:36,559
you're right she's so gracious and so

3875
02:09:35,198 --> 02:09:38,638
she has that that

3876
02:09:36,560 --> 02:09:41,039
that german you know just just gentle

3877
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:42,639
and genteelness um she's a little too

3878
02:09:41,039 --> 02:09:44,000
nice for my taste

3879
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:45,760
i would say i wish she could really say

3880
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:47,439
what she thinks not and be snarky on

3881
02:09:45,760 --> 02:09:49,039
occasion so she wrote a review of my

3882
02:09:47,439 --> 02:09:51,598
book when it came out three or four

3883
02:09:49,039 --> 02:09:53,679
years ago and she uh she said well you

3884
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:55,039
know brian keating like she said well

3885
02:09:53,679 --> 02:09:56,158
it's you know it's a good it's

3886
02:09:55,039 --> 02:09:58,479
interesting he talks about about

3887
02:09:56,158 --> 02:09:59,920
cosmology but you know um

3888
02:09:58,479 --> 02:10:02,078
they can do whatever the hell they want

3889
02:09:59,920 --> 02:10:03,279
and he you know presumably has this you

3890
02:10:02,078 --> 02:10:05,118
know problems with it but it's none of

3891
02:10:03,279 --> 02:10:06,960
his business basically it's a private

3892
02:10:05,118 --> 02:10:08,639
and uh and at the end she said but you

3893
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:10,480
know if you want one good thing he's a

3894
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:11,760
really good writer and who knows he

3895
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:12,799
could win the nobel prize in literature

3896
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:14,000
someday

3897
02:10:12,800 --> 02:10:15,440
and then she allowed me to publish a

3898
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:17,920
rebuttal on her blog which was kind of

3899
02:10:15,439 --> 02:10:19,519
funny but anyway um no so getting back

3900
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:20,118
to the guys that we were you know kind

3901
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,639
of

3902
02:10:20,118 --> 02:10:25,039
collaborators or frenemies and we're

3903
02:10:22,639 --> 02:10:27,199
still look i you know we don't wish each

3904
02:10:25,039 --> 02:10:28,800
other active ill i've visited them

3905
02:10:27,198 --> 02:10:30,799
they're welcome to visit me they have

3906
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:33,520
visited me the thing i have to say is

3907
02:10:30,800 --> 02:10:34,880
that i just wonder about introspection

3908
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:36,639
like for me

3909
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:38,560
literally i don't

3910
02:10:36,639 --> 02:10:41,279
i don't care about the nobel prize other

3911
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:43,440
than what it can do to you know benefit

3912
02:10:41,279 --> 02:10:45,039
science but i no longer i did but by the

3913
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:46,960
way i did seriously care about how i

3914
02:10:45,039 --> 02:10:49,039
benefit brian keating early on in my

3915
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:51,279
career i'm just totally honest i'm not

3916
02:10:49,039 --> 02:10:53,118
proud of it it's kind of embarrassing

3917
02:10:51,279 --> 02:10:55,359
but now i would hope that people would

3918
02:10:53,118 --> 02:10:57,039
say like okay the guy is like you know

3919
02:10:55,359 --> 02:10:58,719
it's not he's obsessed with it my next

3920
02:10:57,039 --> 02:11:00,960
book is not about this it's about

3921
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:03,198
something completely different and um

3922
02:11:00,960 --> 02:11:04,000
you know i i do feel like people

3923
02:11:03,198 --> 02:11:05,839
um

3924
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,279
lack introspection a lot of times in

3925
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:09,039
science like we don't think about why

3926
02:11:07,279 --> 02:11:12,000
we're doing what we're doing and i think

3927
02:11:09,039 --> 02:11:14,319
it comes down to curiosity um one thing

3928
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:16,238
about joe and again i've i've only

3929
02:11:14,319 --> 02:11:17,519
listened to like i have to confess you

3930
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:19,759
know you're like my father now i'm

3931
02:11:17,520 --> 02:11:22,719
confessing my sins it's your father left

3932
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:24,719
friedman um i haven't listened to like

3933
02:11:22,719 --> 02:11:26,399
that many of your episodes start to

3934
02:11:24,719 --> 02:11:28,078
finish okay with our friend mutual

3935
02:11:26,399 --> 02:11:29,598
friend eric i've listened to a bunch of

3936
02:11:28,078 --> 02:11:31,840
recent ones

3937
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:34,078
uh einstein

3938
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:37,880
weinstein uh weinstein weinstein that's

3939
02:11:34,078 --> 02:11:37,880
what it is um

3940
02:11:40,078 --> 02:11:44,399
and a few others i haven't ever listened

3941
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:46,560
to a full joe rogan episode but from

3942
02:11:44,399 --> 02:11:48,719
what i've seen with him he has a pretty

3943
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:50,079
natural curiosity he doesn't have

3944
02:11:48,719 --> 02:11:51,198
passion there are a lot of podcasts you

3945
02:11:50,078 --> 02:11:53,920
have passion like i've been on their

3946
02:11:51,198 --> 02:11:55,839
show he is curiosity like he's not going

3947
02:11:53,920 --> 02:11:57,520
to stop talking about something until he

3948
02:11:55,840 --> 02:12:00,239
hops it until he understands it until he

3949
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:02,079
gets it viscerally and i i respect that

3950
02:12:00,238 --> 02:12:02,799
because as i say in this more recent

3951
02:12:02,078 --> 02:12:04,479
book

3952
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:06,320
passion's like kind of like the the

3953
02:12:04,479 --> 02:12:07,839
dopamine hit that gets you started like

3954
02:12:06,319 --> 02:12:09,279
oh i'm going to be great maybe i could

3955
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:10,639
win a nobel prize like that's not going

3956
02:12:09,279 --> 02:12:13,118
to sustain you

3957
02:12:10,639 --> 02:12:15,679
the sustenance comes from the passion

3958
02:12:13,118 --> 02:12:17,519
converting to curiosity and what i want

3959
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:19,359
to do is convert you know as many things

3960
02:12:17,520 --> 02:12:21,280
as possible to cure to things that i can

3961
02:12:19,359 --> 02:12:23,839
then because actually i've had on you

3962
02:12:21,279 --> 02:12:26,078
know people that that discuss addiction

3963
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:28,159
and there is an addictive quality to you

3964
02:12:26,078 --> 02:12:29,279
know doing doing podcasts or whatever

3965
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:31,920
but there's an addictive quality being a

3966
02:12:29,279 --> 02:12:33,840
scientist and you get to do things that

3967
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:36,239
are very specialized and specialized

3968
02:12:33,840 --> 02:12:38,078
locations with special people uh paid

3969
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:39,839
for by other people have no freaking

3970
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:42,000
idea what you do i mean imagine you

3971
02:12:39,840 --> 02:12:43,840
worked in some like some job and you

3972
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:45,920
know feynman said he said all these

3973
02:12:43,840 --> 02:12:48,319
contradictory things like when he was he

3974
02:12:45,920 --> 02:12:49,599
was once said like he said if you can't

3975
02:12:48,319 --> 02:12:51,359
explain it to your grandmother you don't

3976
02:12:49,599 --> 02:12:52,639
understand it yourself then the day you

3977
02:12:51,359 --> 02:12:54,000
won the nobel prize the reporter asked

3978
02:12:52,639 --> 02:12:55,440
him what'd you win it for he said if i

3979
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:57,039
could explain it to you bud it wouldn't

3980
02:12:55,439 --> 02:12:59,678
be worth a nobel prize so let's leave

3981
02:12:57,039 --> 02:13:01,760
aside his inherent contradictions but um

3982
02:12:59,679 --> 02:13:03,679
but in reality there is a kind of like

3983
02:13:01,760 --> 02:13:04,480
dopamine rush that you get from it but

3984
02:13:03,679 --> 02:13:06,158
um

3985
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:08,638
but you know what is ultimately going to

3986
02:13:06,158 --> 02:13:11,598
be the sustenance of it so yeah i i do

3987
02:13:08,639 --> 02:13:13,520
feel like um we have to find a way to to

3988
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:15,760
nucleate that i don't know actually i

3989
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:17,360
don't know if it's like can you can you

3990
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:19,360
turn someone into us i used to ask this

3991
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:21,198
question all the time like can you make

3992
02:13:19,359 --> 02:13:22,399
someone creative

3993
02:13:21,198 --> 02:13:24,238
like can you teach someone to be

3994
02:13:22,399 --> 02:13:26,238
creative i don't know can you teach

3995
02:13:24,238 --> 02:13:27,919
someone to be curious

3996
02:13:26,238 --> 02:13:29,919
i don't know i do know that kids are

3997
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:31,359
naturally curious as they get older they

3998
02:13:29,920 --> 02:13:33,760
get less curious

3999
02:13:31,359 --> 02:13:36,559
just like i heard from the other forward

4000
02:13:33,760 --> 02:13:38,800
authors james altitude he said once he

4001
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:40,800
did they did a study kids smile 300

4002
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:42,480
times a day or smile or laugh adults

4003
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:44,079
five or six

4004
02:13:42,479 --> 02:13:45,598
five or six no i'm just trying to get

4005
02:13:44,078 --> 02:13:46,960
you to laugh but you're not gonna uh but

4006
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:49,360
anyway no it's true so somewhere you

4007
02:13:46,960 --> 02:13:50,639
lose 30 you know to 50 i'm not

4008
02:13:49,359 --> 02:13:52,479
entertained

4009
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:54,239
but that's because i'm an adult no and

4010
02:13:52,479 --> 02:13:56,158
then i i do remember there's some some

4011
02:13:54,238 --> 02:13:57,839
distribution on those studies with the

4012
02:13:56,158 --> 02:13:59,279
happier adult small a little more but

4013
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:02,000
still the kids blow them out of the

4014
02:13:59,279 --> 02:14:03,198
water russian so can you is it or should

4015
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,880
in other words should we invest our

4016
02:14:03,198 --> 02:14:07,198
energy in

4017
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:08,960
getting the half-life decay constant

4018
02:14:07,198 --> 02:14:11,359
stretched out more for curiosity for

4019
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:13,118
kids or should we try to reset the the

4020
02:14:11,359 --> 02:14:14,559
dopamine hit and then you know i don't

4021
02:14:13,118 --> 02:14:17,198
know it's it's an open question well i i

4022
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:19,280
think um it goes to david foster wallace

4023
02:14:17,198 --> 02:14:20,000
the key to life is to be unbearable i

4024
02:14:19,279 --> 02:14:22,319
think

4025
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:25,198
i think you could train this kind of

4026
02:14:22,319 --> 02:14:28,078
thing which is in every single situation

4027
02:14:25,198 --> 02:14:29,678
so like uh which i think is at the

4028
02:14:28,078 --> 02:14:33,599
at the core at least this correlated

4029
02:14:29,679 --> 02:14:35,679
with curiosity is in every situation

4030
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:38,000
try to find

4031
02:14:35,679 --> 02:14:40,078
the exciting the fascinating like in

4032
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:40,960
every situation you sitting at the i

4033
02:14:40,078 --> 02:14:42,799
don't know

4034
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:45,039
waiting for something at a dmv or

4035
02:14:42,800 --> 02:14:47,920
something like that find something that

4036
02:14:45,039 --> 02:14:51,279
excites you like a thought like uh watch

4037
02:14:47,920 --> 02:14:53,440
people or start to think about well

4038
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:55,599
i wonder how many people

4039
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:57,919
have to go to the dmv every day

4040
02:14:55,599 --> 02:14:59,599
and they try to go into the the pothead

4041
02:14:57,920 --> 02:15:01,199
mode of thinking like

4042
02:14:59,599 --> 02:15:04,000
wow isn't this weird that there's a

4043
02:15:01,198 --> 02:15:06,319
bunch of people that are having to get

4044
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,000
a stamp of approval from the government

4045
02:15:06,319 --> 02:15:09,599
to drive their cars and then there's

4046
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,960
millions of cars driving every day i

4047
02:15:09,599 --> 02:15:12,639
could do this better maybe there's some

4048
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:14,880
blockchain and they could like vin

4049
02:15:12,639 --> 02:15:17,679
transfer yeah exactly yeah no that is a

4050
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:19,440
good that is and then every situation i

4051
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:21,760
think if you rigorously like just

4052
02:15:19,439 --> 02:15:24,238
practice that at a young age i think you

4053
02:15:21,760 --> 02:15:26,079
can learn to do that because like

4054
02:15:24,238 --> 02:15:26,959
sometimes people like ask me for advice

4055
02:15:26,078 --> 02:15:29,759
and like

4056
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:31,599
to do this thing or that thing is i

4057
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:33,119
think you at the core really have to

4058
02:15:31,599 --> 02:15:34,639
have this

4059
02:15:33,118 --> 02:15:36,559
muscle of

4060
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:38,000
finding the awesomeness and everything

4061
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:40,079
because if you're able to find the

4062
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:43,039
awesomeness in everything like whatever

4063
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:45,519
journey you take whatever whatever weird

4064
02:15:43,039 --> 02:15:45,519
um

4065
02:15:45,679 --> 02:15:49,359
that you take through life is going to

4066
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:51,599
be productive it's going to end up in a

4067
02:15:49,359 --> 02:15:54,238
in a great place so like that muscle is

4068
02:15:51,599 --> 02:15:55,920
at the core of it and i guess curiosity

4069
02:15:54,238 --> 02:15:58,238
is uh

4070
02:15:55,920 --> 02:16:00,239
central to that

4071
02:15:58,238 --> 02:16:03,759
but

4072
02:16:00,238 --> 02:16:05,759
you didn't win the nobel prize the team

4073
02:16:03,760 --> 02:16:09,119
of bicep that led the bicep two didn't

4074
02:16:05,760 --> 02:16:13,119
win the nobel prize because of some

4075
02:16:09,118 --> 02:16:13,118
space dust that's right uh

4076
02:16:13,760 --> 02:16:20,560
which one is the moon which one is that

4077
02:16:16,158 --> 02:16:22,399
one's uh dust the space dust yep

4078
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:24,960
what are we looking at so why why is

4079
02:16:22,399 --> 02:16:27,039
space dust the the villain of this whole

4080
02:16:24,960 --> 02:16:28,560
story well it's funny you know i wrote

4081
02:16:27,039 --> 02:16:29,679
these books and i don't know about you

4082
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:31,360
but when you get all these books i'm

4083
02:16:29,679 --> 02:16:32,799
sure you get books people send you books

4084
02:16:31,359 --> 02:16:34,718
they always come in these dust jackets

4085
02:16:32,799 --> 02:16:36,959
right i was like what the hell is a dust

4086
02:16:34,718 --> 02:16:38,079
jack like how much dust is raining down

4087
02:16:36,959 --> 02:16:39,919
at any moment

4088
02:16:38,079 --> 02:16:42,079
i mean this is immaculate this room is

4089
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:43,359
russian tidiness galore but but in a

4090
02:16:42,079 --> 02:16:45,120
normal household how much dust is

4091
02:16:43,359 --> 02:16:48,239
raining down it's not not really pretty

4092
02:16:45,120 --> 02:16:49,760
until i wrote a book and i realized you

4093
02:16:48,239 --> 02:16:51,359
know i'm writing a story about the

4094
02:16:49,760 --> 02:16:54,159
origin of the universe

4095
02:16:51,359 --> 02:16:55,040
and the prologue you know to the cosmos

4096
02:16:54,159 --> 02:16:57,679
and

4097
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:59,280
dust is going to cover this story it was

4098
02:16:57,679 --> 02:17:01,920
actually it's actually more a story

4099
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:04,319
about astrophysics and cosmology than

4100
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:06,159
dust and this is the link between

4101
02:17:04,318 --> 02:17:08,000
the cosmological and the astrophysical

4102
02:17:06,159 --> 02:17:10,239
so what does that mean so astrophysics

4103
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:12,558
is broadly speaking the study of

4104
02:17:10,239 --> 02:17:14,718
physical phenomena manifest in the

4105
02:17:12,558 --> 02:17:16,478
heavens astronomical phenomena

4106
02:17:14,718 --> 02:17:18,398
cosmology is concerned with the origin

4107
02:17:16,478 --> 02:17:19,599
evolution composition of the universe as

4108
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:22,318
a whole but it's not really concerned

4109
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:23,599
with stars galaxies and planets per se

4110
02:17:22,318 --> 02:17:25,840
other than how they might help us

4111
02:17:23,599 --> 02:17:27,519
measure the hubble constant the density

4112
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:29,120
of the universe the neutrino content

4113
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:30,800
etcetera etcetera

4114
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:32,639
so we ten have a tendency to kind of

4115
02:17:30,799 --> 02:17:34,879
look a little bit you know they're like

4116
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:36,239
not all astronomers and astrophysicists

4117
02:17:34,879 --> 02:17:37,759
are equal they're all equal but some are

4118
02:17:36,239 --> 02:17:39,840
more equal than others so we have kind

4119
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:41,280
of a prejudice a little swagger right

4120
02:17:39,840 --> 02:17:42,880
and cosmologists are studying you know

4121
02:17:41,280 --> 02:17:44,479
we're using einstein we're not using

4122
02:17:42,879 --> 02:17:45,679
like you know boltzmann or we're

4123
02:17:44,478 --> 02:17:46,718
thinking of the biggest possible

4124
02:17:45,679 --> 02:17:48,879
pictures

4125
02:17:46,718 --> 02:17:51,119
in so doing you can actually

4126
02:17:48,879 --> 02:17:53,518
become blinded to

4127
02:17:51,120 --> 02:17:55,920
otherwise obvious effects that people

4128
02:17:53,519 --> 02:17:58,478
you know would have not overlooked in

4129
02:17:55,920 --> 02:18:00,960
our case when we sought out the signal

4130
02:17:58,478 --> 02:18:03,039
we were using the photons that make up

4131
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:04,558
this primordial heat bath that surrounds

4132
02:18:03,040 --> 02:18:06,719
the universe luckily only at three

4133
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:08,638
degrees kelvin approximately we're using

4134
02:18:06,718 --> 02:18:11,039
those as a type of film onto which

4135
02:18:08,638 --> 02:18:12,879
gravitational waves will reverberate it

4136
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:14,800
make them oscillate preferentially in a

4137
02:18:12,879 --> 02:18:16,879
polarized way and then we can use our

4138
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:18,879
polarized sunglasses but in

4139
02:18:16,879 --> 02:18:20,799
a microwave format to detect the

4140
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:22,318
characteristic two-fold symmetry pattern

4141
02:18:20,799 --> 02:18:24,000
of under rotation

4142
02:18:22,318 --> 02:18:26,239
that's the technical way that we undergo

4143
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,478
i mean there's a lot more to it um but

4144
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:30,079
there more than one thing that can mimic

4145
02:18:28,478 --> 02:18:31,599
exactly that signal first of all when

4146
02:18:30,079 --> 02:18:33,679
you look at the signal

4147
02:18:31,599 --> 02:18:35,760
the signal if inflation took place big

4148
02:18:33,679 --> 02:18:37,760
if but if it took place

4149
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:39,760
the signal would be about one or two

4150
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:42,880
parts per billion

4151
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:46,079
of the cmb temperature itself

4152
02:18:42,879 --> 02:18:48,718
so a few nano kelvin the cmb is a few

4153
02:18:46,079 --> 02:18:50,558
kelvin the signal from these b modes

4154
02:18:48,718 --> 02:18:52,959
would be a few nano kelvin it's

4155
02:18:50,558 --> 02:18:56,159
astonishing to think pansies and wilson

4156
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:59,358
1965 measured something that's a billion

4157
02:18:56,159 --> 02:19:00,799
times brighter and that was what uh 60

4158
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:02,399
years ago let's call it 60 years ago

4159
02:19:00,799 --> 02:19:04,398
since they discovered it

4160
02:19:02,398 --> 02:19:05,760
moore's law you're more experts let's

4161
02:19:04,398 --> 02:19:07,039
call it every two years

4162
02:19:05,760 --> 02:19:08,398
so you're talking about like 2 to the

4163
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:10,399
30th power

4164
02:19:08,398 --> 02:19:11,840
doubling or something like that at that

4165
02:19:10,398 --> 02:19:14,159
so let's call 2 to the 20th something

4166
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:16,799
like that so that's like only um uh 2 to

4167
02:19:14,159 --> 02:19:18,478
the 10th is a as a as a thousand all

4168
02:19:16,799 --> 02:19:21,199
right correct my math i'm wrong to the

4169
02:19:18,478 --> 02:19:24,398
20th is a million right to the 30th is a

4170
02:19:21,200 --> 02:19:25,280
billion so you we're outpacing moore's

4171
02:19:24,398 --> 02:19:26,879
law

4172
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:28,479
in terms of the sensitivity of our

4173
02:19:26,879 --> 02:19:30,239
instruments to detect these feeble

4174
02:19:28,478 --> 02:19:31,599
signals from the cosmos

4175
02:19:30,239 --> 02:19:33,840
and they don't have to deal with you

4176
02:19:31,599 --> 02:19:35,359
know in the semiconductor fabric factory

4177
02:19:33,840 --> 02:19:37,200
in santa clara california they have to

4178
02:19:35,359 --> 02:19:38,639
deal with like you know meteorites and

4179
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:40,479
aspirin things like coming into the

4180
02:19:38,638 --> 02:19:42,000
laboratory it's a clean room it's

4181
02:19:40,478 --> 02:19:43,438
pristine they can control everything

4182
02:19:42,000 --> 02:19:45,920
about it right we can't control the

4183
02:19:43,439 --> 02:19:48,000
cosmos and the cosmos is literally

4184
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:50,398
littered with particles of schmutz of

4185
02:19:48,000 --> 02:19:52,398
failed planets asteroids

4186
02:19:50,398 --> 02:19:56,000
meteoroids things that didn't coalesce

4187
02:19:52,398 --> 02:19:57,680
to make either the earth the moon the

4188
02:19:56,000 --> 02:19:59,359
planet jupiter or its moons or get

4189
02:19:57,680 --> 02:20:02,239
sucked into them and make craters on

4190
02:19:59,359 --> 02:20:04,318
them etc etc the rest of it is falling

4191
02:20:02,239 --> 02:20:06,559
and it comes in a power spectrum there's

4192
02:20:04,318 --> 02:20:09,199
very few thank god chicksylub size you

4193
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:11,680
know impact uh or you know progenitors

4194
02:20:09,200 --> 02:20:13,600
that will take out all life on earth um

4195
02:20:11,680 --> 02:20:15,840
but there's extremely large number of

4196
02:20:13,600 --> 02:20:17,520
tiny dust particles and microscopic

4197
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:19,520
grains and then there's a fair number of

4198
02:20:17,520 --> 02:20:21,920
intermediate-sized particles

4199
02:20:19,520 --> 02:20:23,200
it turns out this little guy here

4200
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:24,879
is um

4201
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:27,200
is the end product

4202
02:20:24,879 --> 02:20:28,839
of a collapsing star that explodes in

4203
02:20:27,200 --> 02:20:31,439
what's called a supernova type 2

4204
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:36,079
supernova so stars spend most of their

4205
02:20:31,439 --> 02:20:38,159
life using helium nuclei protons into um

4206
02:20:36,079 --> 02:20:40,079
and neutrons into helium

4207
02:20:38,159 --> 02:20:42,478
nuclei and then from there can make

4208
02:20:40,079 --> 02:20:44,239
other things like beryllium and briefly

4209
02:20:42,478 --> 02:20:46,159
make beryllium and carbon nitrogen

4210
02:20:44,239 --> 02:20:47,359
oxygen all the way up until it tries to

4211
02:20:46,159 --> 02:20:48,559
make iron

4212
02:20:47,359 --> 02:20:50,960
and nickel

4213
02:20:48,559 --> 02:20:53,519
iron and nickel are endothermic it takes

4214
02:20:50,959 --> 02:20:56,478
more energy than gets liberated to make

4215
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:58,720
an atom of iron when that happens

4216
02:20:56,478 --> 02:21:00,719
there's no longer enough heat supplying

4217
02:20:58,719 --> 02:21:02,079
pressure to resist the gravitational

4218
02:21:00,719 --> 02:21:04,000
collapse of the material that was

4219
02:21:02,079 --> 02:21:05,920
produced earlier so the star forms goes

4220
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:07,439
inside out that's how

4221
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:08,960
scientists discovered helium was

4222
02:21:07,439 --> 02:21:10,398
discovered on the sun i don't know did

4223
02:21:08,959 --> 02:21:13,039
you know that's why it's called helium

4224
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:15,039
yeah they went there at night and

4225
02:21:13,040 --> 02:21:16,479
oh well done they went there at night no

4226
02:21:15,040 --> 02:21:18,319
helium means helios is the god of the

4227
02:21:16,478 --> 02:21:19,920
sun it was discovered in its spectrum

4228
02:21:18,318 --> 02:21:21,840
from observations of the telescope like

4229
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:24,318
150 years ago it wasn't discovered like

4230
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:26,960
when uh oxygen and you know iron was

4231
02:21:24,318 --> 02:21:28,398
discovered um so it's only a relatively

4232
02:21:26,959 --> 02:21:31,679
recent comer to the pure activity the

4233
02:21:28,398 --> 02:21:33,760
helium came after oxygen oh no first

4234
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:34,960
first hydrogen forms into helium so

4235
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:36,880
that's the first thing that forms now in

4236
02:21:34,959 --> 02:21:39,119
terms of discoveries oh yeah after

4237
02:21:36,879 --> 02:21:41,599
oxygen yeah i think priestly and

4238
02:21:39,120 --> 02:21:43,840
yeah and others dalton discovered it in

4239
02:21:41,600 --> 02:21:45,280
the 1700s no helium was really only

4240
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:46,880
discovered from the spectrum of looking

4241
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:48,159
at the sun and seeing the weird atomic

4242
02:21:46,879 --> 02:21:50,000
absorption and

4243
02:21:48,159 --> 02:21:51,280
called fraunhofer lines in the solar

4244
02:21:50,000 --> 02:21:53,680
spectrum

4245
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:55,520
so but when it tries to make iron

4246
02:21:53,680 --> 02:21:57,280
there's no longer any leftover heat in

4247
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:59,200
other words there's heat left over from

4248
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:01,439
fusing as you know the son of a plasma

4249
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:03,200
physicist you fuse to

4250
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:05,120
hydrogen nuclei you get excess energy

4251
02:22:03,200 --> 02:22:06,960
plus you get helium so that's why fusion

4252
02:22:05,120 --> 02:22:09,120
energy could be the energy source of the

4253
02:22:06,959 --> 02:22:10,799
future and it always will be no no

4254
02:22:09,120 --> 02:22:13,040
hopefully it'll come much sooner than

4255
02:22:10,799 --> 02:22:14,398
that and so doing trying to make iron it

4256
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:16,479
takes more energy doesn't give off

4257
02:22:14,398 --> 02:22:18,398
enough energy star collapses explodes

4258
02:22:16,478 --> 02:22:20,239
and what does it spray out into the you

4259
02:22:18,398 --> 02:22:21,680
know cosmic interstellar medium it

4260
02:22:20,239 --> 02:22:23,920
sprays out the last thing it made which

4261
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:25,600
is that stuff luckily for us because

4262
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:27,840
some of that coalesced and made the core

4263
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:30,239
of the earth onto which the lighter like

4264
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:31,920
silica and carbon and the dirt and the

4265
02:22:30,239 --> 02:22:33,600
crust of the earth were formed and some

4266
02:22:31,920 --> 02:22:35,520
of that made its way to the crust the

4267
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:38,079
iron made its way to the crust some of

4268
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:40,239
that your mother ate and uh synthesized

4269
02:22:38,079 --> 02:22:41,680
hemoglobin molecules and hemoglobin has

4270
02:22:40,239 --> 02:22:43,760
iron particles in it it's a quite

4271
02:22:41,680 --> 02:22:44,960
amazing substance without it you know we

4272
02:22:43,760 --> 02:22:46,079
wouldn't have a red blood we wouldn't

4273
02:22:44,959 --> 02:22:47,199
exist

4274
02:22:46,079 --> 02:22:51,039
as we are

4275
02:22:47,200 --> 02:22:53,200
is this a very long complicated mom joke

4276
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:56,080
i've done enough dad jokes my quota's up

4277
02:22:53,200 --> 02:22:58,079
um so i'm taking this this object uh you

4278
02:22:56,079 --> 02:22:59,439
know seriously there's not all of it

4279
02:22:58,079 --> 02:23:01,760
gets bound up in a planet in fact

4280
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:03,200
forming planets is very inefficient um

4281
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:05,439
and so there's a lot of schmutz left

4282
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:07,200
over some of which gets in the way

4283
02:23:05,439 --> 02:23:09,200
of our telescopes looking back to the

4284
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:11,120
beginning of time and some of those

4285
02:23:09,200 --> 02:23:13,840
molecules like iron is used in compass

4286
02:23:11,120 --> 02:23:16,000
needles right they're magnetized and

4287
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:17,680
magnetic fields in our galaxy can align

4288
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:19,439
them and make the exact polarization

4289
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:21,120
pattern that we're looking for

4290
02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:23,040
as if the compass needles get all

4291
02:23:21,120 --> 02:23:24,720
aligned that's like the polarization of

4292
02:23:23,040 --> 02:23:26,640
of the dust grain it's like that fill

4293
02:23:24,719 --> 02:23:28,879
the polarizing filter that means light

4294
02:23:26,639 --> 02:23:30,159
polarized like this will get absorbed

4295
02:23:28,879 --> 02:23:31,920
and light polarized like this will go

4296
02:23:30,159 --> 02:23:34,000
through so it's absorbing it's making

4297
02:23:31,920 --> 02:23:36,239
100 polarized light out of an initially

4298
02:23:34,000 --> 02:23:38,559
unpolarized light source and that's what

4299
02:23:36,239 --> 02:23:40,879
happened and what we ended up claiming

4300
02:23:38,559 --> 02:23:42,159
we on on march

4301
02:23:40,879 --> 02:23:44,719
17th

4302
02:23:42,159 --> 02:23:46,239
and i'm sure if you were there you might

4303
02:23:44,719 --> 02:23:48,159
remember this at the harvard center for

4304
02:23:46,239 --> 02:23:49,280
astrophysics there was an announcement

4305
02:23:48,159 --> 02:23:51,200
there were like three or four nobel

4306
02:23:49,280 --> 02:23:53,120
prize winners in the audience and the

4307
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:55,200
bicep2 team which i was no longer

4308
02:23:53,120 --> 02:23:56,399
leading i was still a member of it

4309
02:23:55,200 --> 02:23:57,840
in fact in the announcement the first

4310
02:23:56,398 --> 02:24:00,000
person they mentioned

4311
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:02,318
besides you know thank you all for being

4312
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:03,840
here as me and my team at uc san diego

4313
02:24:02,318 --> 02:24:06,159
although i wasn't invited to go to the

4314
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:09,439
press conference uh because that uh

4315
02:24:06,159 --> 02:24:11,039
harvard complicated yes exactly um it's

4316
02:24:09,439 --> 02:24:12,239
a little school up there in the in

4317
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:14,960
cambridge area

4318
02:24:12,239 --> 02:24:16,318
um and so uh they ended up making this

4319
02:24:14,959 --> 02:24:18,799
announcement that we had discovered the

4320
02:24:16,318 --> 02:24:21,680
aftershocks of inflation we detected the

4321
02:24:18,799 --> 02:24:23,920
gravitational waves shaking up the cmb

4322
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:25,120
and on that day past lex friedman

4323
02:24:23,920 --> 02:24:27,200
podcast back when it was called

4324
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:28,560
artificial intelligence max tag mark

4325
02:24:27,200 --> 02:24:30,560
said goodbye

4326
02:24:28,559 --> 02:24:32,000
universe hello multiverse and hello

4327
02:24:30,559 --> 02:24:35,119
nobel prize

4328
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:36,559
see he saw that as confirmatory evidence

4329
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:37,920
not only of inflation not only

4330
02:24:36,559 --> 02:24:40,639
gravitational waves but of the

4331
02:24:37,920 --> 02:24:43,520
multiverse goodbye universe hello

4332
02:24:40,639 --> 02:24:46,079
multiverse multiverse is a natural

4333
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:47,920
consequence consequence of inflation yes

4334
02:24:46,079 --> 02:24:50,478
according to its prominent you know

4335
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:52,799
supporters yeah uh yeah and of course

4336
02:24:50,478 --> 02:24:54,079
leave the poetry to max which uh he does

4337
02:24:52,799 --> 02:24:55,438
masterfully

4338
02:24:54,079 --> 02:24:58,719
okay

4339
02:24:55,439 --> 02:25:00,398
so that the excitement was there i mean

4340
02:24:58,719 --> 02:25:02,000
maybe

4341
02:25:00,398 --> 02:25:04,000
the initial heartbreak for you is there

4342
02:25:02,000 --> 02:25:05,840
too that's that's some of the darker

4343
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:07,680
moments you're going through but broadly

4344
02:25:05,840 --> 02:25:09,760
for the space of science

4345
02:25:07,680 --> 02:25:10,479
there's excitement there

4346
02:25:09,760 --> 02:25:12,559
and

4347
02:25:10,478 --> 02:25:14,000
and i often note that this is a problem

4348
02:25:12,559 --> 02:25:16,398
in what i call you know the science

4349
02:25:14,000 --> 02:25:19,520
media complex because often times you'll

4350
02:25:16,398 --> 02:25:21,760
see things like past gasser seeger

4351
02:25:19,520 --> 02:25:23,600
venus life you know exists and that will

4352
02:25:21,760 --> 02:25:24,800
be really i mean it's fascinating right

4353
02:25:23,600 --> 02:25:26,880
and with the work that she's doing or

4354
02:25:24,799 --> 02:25:29,199
her colleagues are doing uh or clara

4355
02:25:26,879 --> 02:25:30,879
who's on your show as well and

4356
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:32,720
that will be on front page new york

4357
02:25:30,879 --> 02:25:34,639
times boston globe

4358
02:25:32,719 --> 02:25:36,959
san diego union tribune it'll be above

4359
02:25:34,639 --> 02:25:39,279
the fold make headlines around the world

4360
02:25:36,959 --> 02:25:42,879
and then six months 12 months later as a

4361
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:44,960
case for us retraction page c17 of the

4362
02:25:42,879 --> 02:25:47,119
saturday edition that nobody reads you

4363
02:25:44,959 --> 02:25:49,438
know and underneath the personal

4364
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:51,920
so we have a problem in science that the

4365
02:25:49,439 --> 02:25:53,520
you know if it if it if it explodes it

4366
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:55,760
leads you know and we get this huge

4367
02:25:53,520 --> 02:25:57,600
fanfare and this is not unique to my

4368
02:25:55,760 --> 02:25:59,840
experiment this happened with the

4369
02:25:57,600 --> 02:26:01,120
earlier discovery of so-called

4370
02:25:59,840 --> 02:26:03,359
martian life

4371
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:06,079
uh of discovered in antarctica

4372
02:26:03,359 --> 02:26:07,439
um which was announced after peer review

4373
02:26:06,079 --> 02:26:08,559
we weren't peer reviewed at the point

4374
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:09,840
where we made the announcement we had a

4375
02:26:08,559 --> 02:26:12,000
press conference and there are other

4376
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:13,200
reasons that the team leaders felt it

4377
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:14,719
was important to do that so that we

4378
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:16,479
don't get scooped by a referee it was

4379
02:26:14,719 --> 02:26:18,159
unethical we thought we had done

4380
02:26:16,478 --> 02:26:20,398
everything right but that's confirmation

4381
02:26:18,159 --> 02:26:21,680
there's like levels to this yeah there

4382
02:26:20,398 --> 02:26:23,279
were many levels

4383
02:26:21,680 --> 02:26:24,479
and there were people you know me

4384
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:26,399
warning about you know how it would be

4385
02:26:24,478 --> 02:26:28,079
interpreted and wanting to also make

4386
02:26:26,398 --> 02:26:29,519
sure that we put all the data out

4387
02:26:28,079 --> 02:26:31,600
including the maps which we still

4388
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:33,200
haven't released and um so there were a

4389
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:34,479
lot of reasons to be skeptical but the

4390
02:26:33,200 --> 02:26:37,040
audi the

4391
02:26:34,478 --> 02:26:39,039
the public never knows this yeah i think

4392
02:26:37,040 --> 02:26:40,880
it's so i've made a rule that if i am

4393
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:42,880
ever in charge of you know doling out

4394
02:26:40,879 --> 02:26:44,799
large amounts of science funding

4395
02:26:42,879 --> 02:26:46,318
that when you you should keep kind of an

4396
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:48,959
option in other words you should have

4397
02:26:46,318 --> 02:26:51,039
money for publicity it's fine have money

4398
02:26:48,959 --> 02:26:53,679
for your press conference but hold in

4399
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:56,160
reserve in a bond to be used hopefully

4400
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:58,800
never but if it's to be used an equal

4401
02:26:56,159 --> 02:26:59,760
fund for the retraction if it should

4402
02:26:58,799 --> 02:27:01,679
occur

4403
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:03,920
so you would like to see um because

4404
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:06,000
that's a big part of transparency

4405
02:27:03,920 --> 02:27:08,478
is the

4406
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:10,159
to me in the space of science at least

4407
02:27:08,478 --> 02:27:12,000
that's as beautiful

4408
02:27:10,159 --> 02:27:12,959
because it reveals

4409
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:15,120
the

4410
02:27:12,959 --> 02:27:17,679
it's like it's uh it tells a great story

4411
02:27:15,120 --> 02:27:20,880
there's a there's an excitement there's

4412
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:22,720
uh humanity there so there's a climax of

4413
02:27:20,879 --> 02:27:25,279
the triumph but there's also a climax to

4414
02:27:22,719 --> 02:27:28,000
the like the disappointment yeah

4415
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:30,960
because that also eventually leads

4416
02:27:28,000 --> 02:27:32,719
to triumph again that sets up that's the

4417
02:27:30,959 --> 02:27:35,039
drama that sets up the triumph like with

4418
02:27:32,719 --> 02:27:37,599
andrew wiles bringing for mars last

4419
02:27:35,040 --> 02:27:40,000
uh from us theorem as i guess it's not

4420
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,960
lasting whatever the

4421
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:42,719
is

4422
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:44,719
like the ups and downs of that the

4423
02:27:42,719 --> 02:27:46,559
roller coaster the whole thing should be

4424
02:27:44,719 --> 02:27:48,159
science that is science and when we

4425
02:27:46,559 --> 02:27:50,959
don't do that then we cultivate this

4426
02:27:48,159 --> 02:27:53,119
aura that excludes other scientists

4427
02:27:50,959 --> 02:27:54,879
often from minorities or women back

4428
02:27:53,120 --> 02:27:56,240
that you have to be eins like einstein

4429
02:27:54,879 --> 02:27:57,679
came out of the womb and he was just

4430
02:27:56,239 --> 02:28:00,159
like this guy was like curly no he

4431
02:27:57,680 --> 02:28:02,239
wasn't he was he wasn't bad at math that

4432
02:28:00,159 --> 02:28:03,680
was all that's all nonsense but he said

4433
02:28:02,239 --> 02:28:05,760
that he you know when he said he

4434
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:07,520
attributed his success to lex he said i

4435
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:09,920
never asked my dad

4436
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:12,000
what happened when i ran alongside a

4437
02:28:09,920 --> 02:28:13,840
light beam as a kid and thank god i

4438
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:16,079
didn't because had i he would have told

4439
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:16,880
me the best answer of the day which by

4440
02:28:16,079 --> 02:28:18,799
the way

4441
02:28:16,879 --> 02:28:21,438
you know he would create 20 years later

4442
02:28:18,799 --> 02:28:24,159
as a 26 year old in in the patent office

4443
02:28:21,439 --> 02:28:25,600
obviously in switzerland and in so doing

4444
02:28:24,159 --> 02:28:27,680
by delaying when he asked these

4445
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:30,399
questions he said i approached it with

4446
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:32,239
the intellect of a mature scientist not

4447
02:28:30,398 --> 02:28:34,478
a little kid and i wouldn't have

4448
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:36,318
accepted the same explanation so

4449
02:28:34,478 --> 02:28:38,478
sometimes assuming that scientists are

4450
02:28:36,318 --> 02:28:40,559
infallible inevitable

4451
02:28:38,478 --> 02:28:42,239
omniscient you know being i think that

4452
02:28:40,559 --> 02:28:43,439
really does a disservice jim gates said

4453
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:44,879
you know he's like einstein wasn't

4454
02:28:43,439 --> 02:28:47,280
always einstein

4455
02:28:44,879 --> 02:28:49,759
and we cultivate this mystery and allure

4456
02:28:47,280 --> 02:28:52,000
at our peril because we're humans until

4457
02:28:49,760 --> 02:28:54,318
we have artificial einstein which i

4458
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:55,760
don't think will ever exist you've

4459
02:28:54,318 --> 02:28:58,639
launched the

4460
02:28:55,760 --> 02:29:00,559
uh assayer project where you hope to

4461
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:02,799
assess theories of everything with

4462
02:29:00,559 --> 02:29:04,559
experiments you have a youtube video

4463
02:29:02,799 --> 02:29:06,159
where you're announcing that that looks

4464
02:29:04,559 --> 02:29:07,920
super cool

4465
02:29:06,159 --> 02:29:09,520
can you describe this project and you

4466
02:29:07,920 --> 02:29:12,318
also mentioned kind of you give a shout

4467
02:29:09,520 --> 02:29:14,479
out to a little known fellow by the name

4468
02:29:12,318 --> 02:29:17,119
of galileo galilei

4469
02:29:14,478 --> 02:29:20,239
as an inspiration to this project

4470
02:29:17,120 --> 02:29:22,880
yeah so galileo is kind of my my avatar

4471
02:29:20,239 --> 02:29:24,559
my hero the kind of all-around scientist

4472
02:29:22,879 --> 02:29:26,879
that i would love to

4473
02:29:24,559 --> 02:29:29,840
approach the you know logarithm of

4474
02:29:26,879 --> 02:29:30,959
galileo he was not only a phenomenal

4475
02:29:29,840 --> 02:29:32,239
scientist

4476
02:29:30,959 --> 02:29:35,438
he was

4477
02:29:32,239 --> 02:29:36,719
an incredible artist a writer a poet a

4478
02:29:35,439 --> 02:29:37,600
philosopher

4479
02:29:36,719 --> 02:29:39,279
and back then they didn't have

4480
02:29:37,600 --> 02:29:41,120
distinctions between you know scientists

4481
02:29:39,280 --> 02:29:42,159
and i was like a physician was like a

4482
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:45,120
physicist

4483
02:29:42,159 --> 02:29:47,119
um and he would indulge you know kind of

4484
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:48,160
these really intellectual flights of

4485
02:29:47,120 --> 02:29:51,439
fancy

4486
02:29:48,159 --> 02:29:53,760
thinking about uh phenomena such as the

4487
02:29:51,439 --> 02:29:55,760
earth's tides or the or you know the

4488
02:29:53,760 --> 02:29:58,478
composition of the milky way and what's

4489
02:29:55,760 --> 02:30:00,719
interesting about galileo is that he was

4490
02:29:58,478 --> 02:30:03,519
almost as wrong often as he was right

4491
02:30:00,719 --> 02:30:05,920
and galileo was not alone like this i

4492
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:08,000
always say like einstein had at least

4493
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:09,920
seven nobel prizes that he could have

4494
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:12,000
won for discoveries that later became

4495
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:14,318
true but he also had seven

4496
02:30:12,000 --> 02:30:16,398
you know huge you know impossible to

4497
02:30:14,318 --> 02:30:17,680
believe blunders in some sense

4498
02:30:16,398 --> 02:30:19,599
um it's too bad because he could have

4499
02:30:17,680 --> 02:30:21,680
had a good career as i would say uh and

4500
02:30:19,600 --> 02:30:24,880
galileo was like that too in other words

4501
02:30:21,680 --> 02:30:27,120
he would fall victim to i think this

4502
02:30:24,879 --> 02:30:29,199
confirmation bias that all scientists

4503
02:30:27,120 --> 02:30:31,200
have to guard their lives against their

4504
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:33,600
careers their brands their reputations

4505
02:30:31,200 --> 02:30:35,200
against which is the exclusion of

4506
02:30:33,600 --> 02:30:37,280
evidence that doesn't conform to what

4507
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:38,240
you're trying to prove for one reason or

4508
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:40,640
another

4509
02:30:38,239 --> 02:30:42,959
or the radical acceptance of things that

4510
02:30:40,639 --> 02:30:44,719
do comport with it in order to bolster

4511
02:30:42,959 --> 02:30:46,879
your confidence and both are equally

4512
02:30:44,719 --> 02:30:49,199
intoxicating it's a you know

4513
02:30:46,879 --> 02:30:52,079
confirmation bias is a hell of a drug uh

4514
02:30:49,200 --> 02:30:54,399
because it it really you know reinforces

4515
02:30:52,079 --> 02:30:56,079
this notion which is partially sunk cost

4516
02:30:54,398 --> 02:30:57,920
you put so much time effort money

4517
02:30:56,079 --> 02:31:00,478
reputation into it you don't want to be

4518
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:02,960
wrong and go back on it and with galileo

4519
02:31:00,478 --> 02:31:04,879
he would uh he would be

4520
02:31:02,959 --> 02:31:07,279
incredibly perceptive

4521
02:31:04,879 --> 02:31:08,639
about things such as um you know the

4522
02:31:07,280 --> 02:31:10,560
earth being

4523
02:31:08,639 --> 02:31:12,559
not located at the center of the solar

4524
02:31:10,559 --> 02:31:14,559
system and the sun being the center so

4525
02:31:12,559 --> 02:31:17,519
called copernican hypothesis

4526
02:31:14,559 --> 02:31:19,760
um and he would use as evidence very

4527
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:21,760
very interesting ideas that all of which

4528
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:23,840
were wrong basically and in fact we

4529
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:25,680
weren't able to prove that the earth

4530
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:27,840
orbited around the sun and i ask you

4531
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:29,520
like can you prove the earth is is not

4532
02:31:27,840 --> 02:31:31,760
flat no well you're a flat earther

4533
02:31:29,520 --> 02:31:34,720
anyway but um but but it's i asked my

4534
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:38,159
crowd uh flat earth society member

4535
02:31:34,719 --> 02:31:38,159
t-shirts coming out soon

4536
02:31:38,239 --> 02:31:42,000
merch slash merch

4537
02:31:40,478 --> 02:31:43,279
but it's actually not trivial to do that

4538
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:44,799
but most of my students graduate

4539
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:46,319
students can prove that the earth is

4540
02:31:44,799 --> 02:31:48,079
rounder explain how the earth it is

4541
02:31:46,318 --> 02:31:50,000
actually not trivial to do though it's

4542
02:31:48,079 --> 02:31:51,600
not yeah and much harder is to prove

4543
02:31:50,000 --> 02:31:53,280
that the earth goes around the sun in

4544
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:55,040
fact that's extremely hard to prove and

4545
02:31:53,280 --> 02:31:56,479
and almost none of my students even

4546
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:58,319
after they get their phd in the final

4547
02:31:56,478 --> 02:31:59,519
exam i kind of like to just you know

4548
02:31:58,318 --> 02:32:01,199
give them a little bit of humility

4549
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:02,800
because i think to be a good scientist

4550
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:04,159
you need to be humble you need to have a

4551
02:32:02,799 --> 02:32:05,920
little humility and you need to have

4552
02:32:04,159 --> 02:32:07,920
swagger you need to feel like a little

4553
02:32:05,920 --> 02:32:09,359
cocky like i can do this i can do this

4554
02:32:07,920 --> 02:32:11,280
thing that einstein by definition

4555
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:12,720
couldn't do i'm going to attempt it i'm

4556
02:32:11,280 --> 02:32:15,359
going to attempt to do what was

4557
02:32:12,719 --> 02:32:17,840
impossible just a generation ago how do

4558
02:32:15,359 --> 02:32:19,840
you uh prove that the earth goes around

4559
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:22,318
the sun do you have to

4560
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:23,520
is it by the motion of other planets so

4561
02:32:22,318 --> 02:32:24,719
there are many ways to do it i mean

4562
02:32:23,520 --> 02:32:27,120
obviously you could take a spaceship

4563
02:32:24,719 --> 02:32:29,039
park it at the north celestial pole of

4564
02:32:27,120 --> 02:32:31,200
our solar system and and just watch what

4565
02:32:29,040 --> 02:32:33,040
happens uh but obviously that wasn't how

4566
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:35,120
was discovered in the late 1700s so it's

4567
02:32:33,040 --> 02:32:38,160
called aberration so if you look at

4568
02:32:35,120 --> 02:32:40,319
stars um uh as the earth orbits around

4569
02:32:38,159 --> 02:32:42,639
the sun uh the position of the stars

4570
02:32:40,318 --> 02:32:44,079
will shift slightly because of the tilt

4571
02:32:42,639 --> 02:32:46,079
of the earth and because the earth is in

4572
02:32:44,079 --> 02:32:48,398
motion around the earth and around the

4573
02:32:46,079 --> 02:32:50,719
sun and because the earth has a non a

4574
02:32:48,398 --> 02:32:52,559
trivial amount of velocity compared to

4575
02:32:50,719 --> 02:32:53,519
the speed of light in its orbit around

4576
02:32:52,559 --> 02:32:55,119
the sun

4577
02:32:53,520 --> 02:32:57,040
the stars will trace out little tiny

4578
02:32:55,120 --> 02:32:59,120
ellipses and those will correspond to

4579
02:32:57,040 --> 02:33:00,800
the fact that we're moving around

4580
02:32:59,120 --> 02:33:02,079
if they're at infinite distance which we

4581
02:33:00,799 --> 02:33:03,759
assume that they are they're not really

4582
02:33:02,079 --> 02:33:05,120
but for all intents and purposes and the

4583
02:33:03,760 --> 02:33:06,880
scale of the solar system are infinitely

4584
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:08,079
far away so that's called stellar

4585
02:33:06,879 --> 02:33:09,839
aberration

4586
02:33:08,079 --> 02:33:11,439
and that was the first way it was

4587
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:13,120
discovered and actually we still use

4588
02:33:11,439 --> 02:33:15,120
that we have to correct for that effect

4589
02:33:13,120 --> 02:33:17,120
we measure the cosmic microwave

4590
02:33:15,120 --> 02:33:19,200
background because imagine you're inside

4591
02:33:17,120 --> 02:33:21,120
of an oven it has some temperature three

4592
02:33:19,200 --> 02:33:23,200
kelvin a thousand kelvin whatever if

4593
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:24,319
you're moving towards you the photons

4594
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:26,479
that are coming to me in that direction

4595
02:33:24,318 --> 02:33:28,079
will be blue shifted hotter and the ones

4596
02:33:26,478 --> 02:33:30,478
behind me will be redshifted i'll

4597
02:33:28,079 --> 02:33:32,478
artificially impute a greater or lesser

4598
02:33:30,478 --> 02:33:33,438
amount of matter or energy where you are

4599
02:33:32,478 --> 02:33:34,879
and it's a

4600
02:33:33,439 --> 02:33:36,960
extension of the doppler effect so we

4601
02:33:34,879 --> 02:33:38,478
actually make use of that and construct

4602
02:33:36,959 --> 02:33:39,438
what's called like a local standard of

4603
02:33:38,478 --> 02:33:41,679
rust

4604
02:33:39,439 --> 02:33:43,200
anyway um so you can do it but galileo

4605
02:33:41,680 --> 02:33:45,600
said no no i'm not going to wait for

4606
02:33:43,200 --> 02:33:47,920
that i have other proofs for it

4607
02:33:45,600 --> 02:33:49,680
one of which is that the earth has tides

4608
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:52,159
and the tides come in and out twice a

4609
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:54,159
day high tide and low tide and it's he

4610
02:33:52,159 --> 02:33:55,200
made the analogy of because the earth is

4611
02:33:54,159 --> 02:33:57,439
moving

4612
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:59,040
around the sun say this is the sun here

4613
02:33:57,439 --> 02:34:00,559
and it's moving around the sun but it's

4614
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:03,280
also rotating on its axis see how the

4615
02:34:00,559 --> 02:34:05,519
water is sloshing up and down inside the

4616
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:06,800
vodka bottle um as that happens he said

4617
02:34:05,520 --> 02:34:08,640
that's what the tides are caused by

4618
02:34:06,799 --> 02:34:10,478
totally wrong most people listen to this

4619
02:34:08,639 --> 02:34:11,920
podcast just just

4620
02:34:10,478 --> 02:34:13,920
just so you know if you're listening to

4621
02:34:11,920 --> 02:34:16,239
this he actually has a bottle of vodka

4622
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:18,000
in his hand half drunk

4623
02:34:16,239 --> 02:34:20,879
and we're both

4624
02:34:18,000 --> 02:34:22,639
drunk and whatever else is possible so

4625
02:34:20,879 --> 02:34:23,839
as it sloshed around he claimed that was

4626
02:34:22,639 --> 02:34:25,519
but now it has nothing to do with that

4627
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:28,559
the moon

4628
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:30,479
over there the moon pulls differentially

4629
02:34:28,559 --> 02:34:32,959
on the earth and the earth's ocean

4630
02:34:30,478 --> 02:34:35,039
that causes the oceans to bulge slightly

4631
02:34:32,959 --> 02:34:36,559
towards and away from where the moon is

4632
02:34:35,040 --> 02:34:38,479
and the moon is actually the source of

4633
02:34:36,559 --> 02:34:40,559
the earth's tides it has nothing to do

4634
02:34:38,478 --> 02:34:42,478
with copernicus the orbit of the center

4635
02:34:40,559 --> 02:34:44,639
so he was totally wrong about that he

4636
02:34:42,478 --> 02:34:46,398
also thought that the milky way was

4637
02:34:44,639 --> 02:34:48,639
comprised only of stars when we know

4638
02:34:46,398 --> 02:34:50,799
it's made of gas dust nebulae and things

4639
02:34:48,639 --> 02:34:52,959
like that so he had a fair share of

4640
02:34:50,799 --> 02:34:55,119
blunders now one thing i always kind of

4641
02:34:52,959 --> 02:34:57,279
make note of and i'm actually

4642
02:34:55,120 --> 02:35:00,800
producing along with jim gates

4643
02:34:57,280 --> 02:35:03,040
fabiola giannatti frank wilczyk um and

4644
02:35:00,799 --> 02:35:05,358
uh carlo revelli and my friend lucio

4645
02:35:03,040 --> 02:35:07,359
picarillo the first ever audiobook of

4646
02:35:05,359 --> 02:35:08,960
one of gal of galileo's dialogue the one

4647
02:35:07,359 --> 02:35:11,040
where he claimed to find evidence for

4648
02:35:08,959 --> 02:35:12,398
the orbit of the earth around the sun

4649
02:35:11,040 --> 02:35:14,640
but it was an error

4650
02:35:12,398 --> 02:35:16,398
so you're reading parts of this text

4651
02:35:14,639 --> 02:35:19,039
yeah it's just incredible brilliant book

4652
02:35:16,398 --> 02:35:20,639
so this book is uh was written in 1632

4653
02:35:19,040 --> 02:35:22,479
it was written and it was the one that

4654
02:35:20,639 --> 02:35:24,559
caused him to go into house arrest and

4655
02:35:22,478 --> 02:35:27,679
almost threatened to be tortured and

4656
02:35:24,559 --> 02:35:30,559
that book um laid out his arguments for

4657
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:34,239
what was called the copernican or the um

4658
02:35:30,559 --> 02:35:37,039
uh non-peripatetic aristotelian etc

4659
02:35:34,239 --> 02:35:39,119
notion of the planetary dynamic

4660
02:35:37,040 --> 02:35:40,960
and and eventually he was forced to

4661
02:35:39,120 --> 02:35:42,880
recant that he believed in it and

4662
02:35:40,959 --> 02:35:44,799
allegedly he said he still believes the

4663
02:35:42,879 --> 02:35:46,159
earth moves anyway so we're making that

4664
02:35:44,799 --> 02:35:47,358
it's written in the form of a trilog

4665
02:35:46,159 --> 02:35:49,200
it's actually called the dialogue but

4666
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:52,559
it's three people there's one named

4667
02:35:49,200 --> 02:35:53,920
salviati who is espousing galileo's

4668
02:35:52,559 --> 02:35:56,079
notions about how the heavens were

4669
02:35:53,920 --> 02:35:58,559
orchestrated and salviante means like

4670
02:35:56,079 --> 02:36:00,879
the salvation the savior then there's a

4671
02:35:58,559 --> 02:36:04,000
middleman segreto so carlo revelli is

4672
02:36:00,879 --> 02:36:06,000
playing salviati brilliant one

4673
02:36:04,000 --> 02:36:08,639
i am playing segredo who's like an

4674
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:10,559
intelligent interlocutor i'm you know

4675
02:36:08,639 --> 02:36:12,559
kind of just i can appreciate aristotle

4676
02:36:10,559 --> 02:36:15,519
i can appreciate copernicus then there's

4677
02:36:12,559 --> 02:36:18,318
this guy simplicio the simpleton and he

4678
02:36:15,520 --> 02:36:20,000
espouses the words of the pope so you

4679
02:36:18,318 --> 02:36:21,760
can imagine like you know you're working

4680
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:24,559
in the putin's government or you're

4681
02:36:21,760 --> 02:36:26,398
working in whatever uh and uh and all of

4682
02:36:24,559 --> 02:36:28,879
a sudden you're you're kind of putting

4683
02:36:26,398 --> 02:36:30,239
the words of of like the fool literally

4684
02:36:28,879 --> 02:36:32,639
calling the fool but you're using the

4685
02:36:30,239 --> 02:36:34,318
words of the all-supreme powerful being

4686
02:36:32,639 --> 02:36:36,398
on earth at that time as the vatican

4687
02:36:34,318 --> 02:36:38,639
church especially for an italian like

4688
02:36:36,398 --> 02:36:42,318
galileo so he wasn't as brilliant you

4689
02:36:38,639 --> 02:36:44,559
know politically uh as he was uh

4690
02:36:42,318 --> 02:36:47,039
astrophysically and otherwise who's

4691
02:36:44,559 --> 02:36:49,039
who's uh doing some cliche so plicio is

4692
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:51,359
a friend a friend of mine in university

4693
02:36:49,040 --> 02:36:53,280
of manchester named luccio picciorello

4694
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:55,200
he's a irish guy but he has an attack no

4695
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:57,120
no he's he's a full-blooded italian but

4696
02:36:55,200 --> 02:36:59,600
they all speak english and italian i

4697
02:36:57,120 --> 02:37:01,760
only speak uh and that forwards are

4698
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:04,079
written by so one forward and this place

4699
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:06,559
has three four words uh which is like a

4700
02:37:04,079 --> 02:37:08,719
12 word

4701
02:37:06,559 --> 02:37:10,478
okay uh the four words are written for

4702
02:37:08,719 --> 02:37:12,959
me yeah that was a good one uh the four

4703
02:37:10,478 --> 02:37:15,358
word three four words one of them is

4704
02:37:12,959 --> 02:37:17,839
written by albert einstein in which he

4705
02:37:15,359 --> 02:37:19,359
says galileo was not only one of the

4706
02:37:17,840 --> 02:37:21,520
greatest scientists in history this is

4707
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:23,760
einstein telling galileo

4708
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:26,800
but he was one of the greatest writers

4709
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:28,800
and minds of all of human history that

4710
02:37:26,799 --> 02:37:29,759
forward is read by frank wilczak who

4711
02:37:28,799 --> 02:37:32,079
you've had

4712
02:37:29,760 --> 02:37:34,960
um jim gates you've also had he reads

4713
02:37:32,079 --> 02:37:37,039
the translation um uh the translator

4714
02:37:34,959 --> 02:37:39,679
stillman drake is a renowned uh

4715
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:42,560
scientific translator and then fabiola

4716
02:37:39,680 --> 02:37:43,760
giannatti she reads the introduction and

4717
02:37:42,559 --> 02:37:47,119
dedication

4718
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:48,719
from galileo to the duke of tuscany and

4719
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:50,479
uh and some of the different

4720
02:37:48,719 --> 02:37:52,318
introductions that galileo himself had

4721
02:37:50,478 --> 02:37:54,239
it's just it's it's such a thrill to be

4722
02:37:52,318 --> 02:37:56,559
able to do it i only randomly found out

4723
02:37:54,239 --> 02:37:58,398
because i had i wanted to study it and

4724
02:37:56,559 --> 02:38:00,000
it's like 500 pages long and i was like

4725
02:37:58,398 --> 02:38:02,159
let me get the book because i'm an audio

4726
02:38:00,000 --> 02:38:04,000
medium kind of guy didn't exist so i

4727
02:38:02,159 --> 02:38:05,359
said let's do it ourselves and so we did

4728
02:38:04,000 --> 02:38:07,520
it and hopefully it'll be out on

4729
02:38:05,359 --> 02:38:09,280
galileo's birthday uh which is february

4730
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:12,000
15 2022

4731
02:38:09,280 --> 02:38:14,159
he'll be a ripe 457 but that's not the

4732
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:15,439
only one of his books galileo wrote many

4733
02:38:14,159 --> 02:38:17,039
books

4734
02:38:15,439 --> 02:38:19,439
one of which is called the military

4735
02:38:17,040 --> 02:38:21,200
compass and this is an interesting book

4736
02:38:19,439 --> 02:38:24,239
for my blockchain and your blockchain

4737
02:38:21,200 --> 02:38:26,000
aficionados in this book he talks about

4738
02:38:24,239 --> 02:38:27,920
a compass which is not a magnetic

4739
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:30,478
compass but actual like slide roll it's

4740
02:38:27,920 --> 02:38:32,879
basically a slider rule and he he it's a

4741
02:38:30,478 --> 02:38:34,318
manual it's like imagine if your phone

4742
02:38:32,879 --> 02:38:36,000
you know came with a manual nowadays

4743
02:38:34,318 --> 02:38:38,239
they don't right but this was a manual

4744
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:40,318
for how to use this slide roll which is

4745
02:38:38,239 --> 02:38:41,920
like enormously important and it gives a

4746
02:38:40,318 --> 02:38:43,760
whole bunch of work examples it's a

4747
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:45,920
brilliant book one of the examples is

4748
02:38:43,760 --> 02:38:47,439
how do you convert money so he does a

4749
02:38:45,920 --> 02:38:50,960
money conversion currency conversion

4750
02:38:47,439 --> 02:38:53,439
between ducati and florentine ducati and

4751
02:38:50,959 --> 02:38:54,839
scooty and whatever you know lyra

4752
02:38:53,439 --> 02:38:57,120
whatever he does all these currency

4753
02:38:54,840 --> 02:38:59,600
conversions one copy of this book or

4754
02:38:57,120 --> 02:39:02,079
maybe maybe two exist first printings

4755
02:38:59,600 --> 02:39:05,120
from 1600 still exist

4756
02:39:02,079 --> 02:39:08,559
if galileo had just kept those in his

4757
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:10,079
family they're worth 100 million dollars

4758
02:39:08,559 --> 02:39:12,559
nowadays you can't get a scooty a

4759
02:39:10,079 --> 02:39:13,840
scooty's worth nothing like a ducati's

4760
02:39:12,559 --> 02:39:15,600
worth not i mean maybe some collector

4761
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:18,398
wants a piece of paper right so it's a

4762
02:39:15,600 --> 02:39:19,840
lesson like there are value in physical

4763
02:39:18,398 --> 02:39:22,478
you know non-fungible tokens this

4764
02:39:19,840 --> 02:39:24,239
original non-fungible token so um but

4765
02:39:22,478 --> 02:39:26,239
then a third book is called the assayer

4766
02:39:24,239 --> 02:39:28,000
so what is an assay

4767
02:39:26,239 --> 02:39:29,760
so assayers were kind of like these

4768
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:32,079
alchemists you know physicists chemists

4769
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:34,000
that would uh would would be around a

4770
02:39:32,079 --> 02:39:35,120
court and every so often for the

4771
02:39:34,000 --> 02:39:37,040
treasurer

4772
02:39:35,120 --> 02:39:38,560
they would want to accept pieces of gold

4773
02:39:37,040 --> 02:39:40,640
from the citizens and convert that to

4774
02:39:38,559 --> 02:39:42,799
script or you know paper money

4775
02:39:40,639 --> 02:39:44,799
and to do that they needed someone to

4776
02:39:42,799 --> 02:39:47,639
verify with a standard of gold that they

4777
02:39:44,799 --> 02:39:50,079
knew to be gold and uh do some kind of

4778
02:39:47,639 --> 02:39:51,840
semi-non-destructive evaluation of the

4779
02:39:50,079 --> 02:39:53,039
purported object the metal that was

4780
02:39:51,840 --> 02:39:55,359
supposed to be gold

4781
02:39:53,040 --> 02:39:56,960
so they would take these pieces of gold

4782
02:39:55,359 --> 02:39:58,960
theoretically gold and they would rub it

4783
02:39:56,959 --> 02:40:00,559
on something called a touchstone

4784
02:39:58,959 --> 02:40:03,279
touchstone was a special piece of rock

4785
02:40:00,559 --> 02:40:05,359
granite whatever it has no intrinsic

4786
02:40:03,280 --> 02:40:08,560
value it's just a piece of rock but with

4787
02:40:05,359 --> 02:40:10,640
that rock you could assay and determine

4788
02:40:08,559 --> 02:40:12,239
the content of this thing that could be

4789
02:40:10,639 --> 02:40:13,840
worth you know millions of lira or

4790
02:40:12,239 --> 02:40:15,840
whatever right so it's incredibly

4791
02:40:13,840 --> 02:40:17,840
important job and

4792
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:19,359
so this person would take this piece of

4793
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:21,439
inanimate rock and use it to do

4794
02:40:19,359 --> 02:40:23,920
something valuable what i want to do in

4795
02:40:21,439 --> 02:40:26,398
the assayer project is take this

4796
02:40:23,920 --> 02:40:28,559
plethora of physical theories of

4797
02:40:26,398 --> 02:40:30,000
everything i said recently you know we

4798
02:40:28,559 --> 02:40:31,278
should give a nobel prize to someone who

4799
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:33,920
doesn't come up with a theory of

4800
02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:34,720
everything because there's just that's

4801
02:40:33,920 --> 02:40:36,960
good

4802
02:40:34,719 --> 02:40:39,039
there's just like it's just rotten with

4803
02:40:36,959 --> 02:40:41,599
them and and and i think it's great you

4804
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:42,960
know i often say that um

4805
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:45,120
theory is kind of like software and i'm

4806
02:40:42,959 --> 02:40:46,719
not denigrating software at all but like

4807
02:40:45,120 --> 02:40:49,200
you can create a lot of software you can

4808
02:40:46,719 --> 02:40:50,879
make a coin and it'll make its own quine

4809
02:40:49,200 --> 02:40:52,800
and like you can make infinite amounts

4810
02:40:50,879 --> 02:40:54,639
of stuff look it up kids that's one of

4811
02:40:52,799 --> 02:40:55,840
my favorite videos and you can see you

4812
02:40:54,639 --> 02:40:57,119
can replicate you can't replicate you

4813
02:40:55,840 --> 02:40:58,719
can't make a telescope that makes a

4814
02:40:57,120 --> 02:40:59,840
telescope that makes it in other words

4815
02:40:58,719 --> 02:41:01,519
hardware is kind of like the

4816
02:40:59,840 --> 02:41:03,279
non-fungible token that's the ultimate

4817
02:41:01,520 --> 02:41:05,200
minted you know limited edition the book

4818
02:41:03,279 --> 02:41:07,840
the the compass book

4819
02:41:05,200 --> 02:41:09,439
and so um it's very expensive that means

4820
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:13,279
you have to be very careful before you

4821
02:41:09,439 --> 02:41:14,800
invest decades billions and humans into

4822
02:41:13,279 --> 02:41:16,800
pursuing one of these theories of

4823
02:41:14,799 --> 02:41:18,639
everything you have to have good

4824
02:41:16,799 --> 02:41:21,358
intuition for it and lately what i've

4825
02:41:18,639 --> 02:41:24,318
seen is not predictions but

4826
02:41:21,359 --> 02:41:25,680
retrodictions so you see that the large

4827
02:41:24,318 --> 02:41:28,000
hadron collider will come out with a

4828
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:30,159
measurement and then so-and-so will say

4829
02:41:28,000 --> 02:41:32,719
oh this is uh you know this is

4830
02:41:30,159 --> 02:41:34,398
compatible with string theory or g minus

4831
02:41:32,719 --> 02:41:36,799
two of the muon it has these bizarre

4832
02:41:34,398 --> 02:41:37,920
properties fifth force string theory

4833
02:41:36,799 --> 02:41:40,719
predicts this

4834
02:41:37,920 --> 02:41:43,760
um string theory solves this um

4835
02:41:40,719 --> 02:41:45,519
neutrinos uh sterile neutrinos uh large

4836
02:41:43,760 --> 02:41:48,000
hadron collider

4837
02:41:45,520 --> 02:41:49,920
bottom or b experiment blah blah they'll

4838
02:41:48,000 --> 02:41:51,600
say that it's compatible after the fact

4839
02:41:49,920 --> 02:41:53,279
and it's not so bad right because look

4840
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:54,800
what did einstein do with gr general

4841
02:41:53,279 --> 02:41:57,120
relativity

4842
02:41:54,799 --> 02:41:59,358
the first thing he did was not predict

4843
02:41:57,120 --> 02:42:01,520
something new he looked at the anomalous

4844
02:41:59,359 --> 02:42:03,680
behavior of the planet mercury and he

4845
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:05,120
saw it was behaving strangely and people

4846
02:42:03,680 --> 02:42:07,040
had said oh that's because there's

4847
02:42:05,120 --> 02:42:08,720
another planet hiding behind the sun

4848
02:42:07,040 --> 02:42:09,840
that we can't see that perturbs the

4849
02:42:08,719 --> 02:42:11,519
orbit of the planet mercury and it's

4850
02:42:09,840 --> 02:42:13,279
always called vulcan

4851
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:15,040
um that was one approach that's kind of

4852
02:42:13,279 --> 02:42:16,640
like the dark matter approach where it's

4853
02:42:15,040 --> 02:42:18,960
like there's a clump of matter that we

4854
02:42:16,639 --> 02:42:21,039
can't see that's influencing the planet

4855
02:42:18,959 --> 02:42:23,119
that we can't see and we use that to

4856
02:42:21,040 --> 02:42:24,399
divine and intuit the existence of the

4857
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:26,240
other planet that's actually how neptune

4858
02:42:24,398 --> 02:42:27,599
was discovered neptune was discovered

4859
02:42:26,239 --> 02:42:30,159
because of the anomalous behavior of the

4860
02:42:27,600 --> 02:42:32,000
planet uranus so neptune was dark we

4861
02:42:30,159 --> 02:42:34,879
couldn't see it it was tugging on uranus

4862
02:42:32,000 --> 02:42:36,478
in a certain way and that led to laverie

4863
02:42:34,879 --> 02:42:38,079
discovering the planet predicting where

4864
02:42:36,478 --> 02:42:40,159
this planet should be found

4865
02:42:38,079 --> 02:42:41,680
so it had a good heritage in physics

4866
02:42:40,159 --> 02:42:43,520
right to predict this planet that you

4867
02:42:41,680 --> 02:42:46,079
couldn't see that worked but einstein

4868
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:47,920
said no um it's caused by the warping

4869
02:42:46,079 --> 02:42:49,520
and bending of space-time due to the

4870
02:42:47,920 --> 02:42:50,960
presence of matter

4871
02:42:49,520 --> 02:42:53,439
would later become known as the einstein

4872
02:42:50,959 --> 02:42:54,879
equations so he he explained why mercury

4873
02:42:53,439 --> 02:42:56,479
did that he didn't it was known since

4874
02:42:54,879 --> 02:42:58,719
the time of newton that mercury was

4875
02:42:56,478 --> 02:43:00,478
behaving in this really freaky way so he

4876
02:42:58,719 --> 02:43:02,719
didn't predict it he retrodicted it

4877
02:43:00,478 --> 02:43:04,159
that's fine but at some point you should

4878
02:43:02,719 --> 02:43:06,318
come up with something new that's

4879
02:43:04,159 --> 02:43:08,559
uniquely predictive of your theory as i

4880
02:43:06,318 --> 02:43:10,318
just said the theory of dark matter in

4881
02:43:08,559 --> 02:43:11,920
the context of neptune is actually a

4882
02:43:10,318 --> 02:43:13,600
valid theory it just happens not to make

4883
02:43:11,920 --> 02:43:16,318
sense in the context of

4884
02:43:13,600 --> 02:43:19,120
vulcan and so um if he had kept doing

4885
02:43:16,318 --> 02:43:20,639
that maybe you know maybe perhaps he

4886
02:43:19,120 --> 02:43:22,240
wouldn't have come up with these other

4887
02:43:20,639 --> 02:43:23,840
predictions that he would later reject

4888
02:43:22,239 --> 02:43:25,680
like he rejected the existence of

4889
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:27,439
gravitational waves you and barry talked

4890
02:43:25,680 --> 02:43:28,960
about that he didn't actually believe it

4891
02:43:27,439 --> 02:43:30,800
was the one peer-reviewed paper that he

4892
02:43:28,959 --> 02:43:32,559
had you know he used to send back in

4893
02:43:30,799 --> 02:43:34,799
those days he sent a letter to nature

4894
02:43:32,559 --> 02:43:36,719
physical review publish this you know

4895
02:43:34,799 --> 02:43:38,239
let me know how much it cost

4896
02:43:36,719 --> 02:43:40,478
and they got it rejected because he said

4897
02:43:38,239 --> 02:43:42,000
you can't detect gravitational waves and

4898
02:43:40,478 --> 02:43:43,119
actually or they're not real and the

4899
02:43:42,000 --> 02:43:45,520
guys show that they're real because he

4900
02:43:43,120 --> 02:43:48,079
can't corrected a math error in einstein

4901
02:43:45,520 --> 02:43:50,720
and rosen's paper um so it's fascinating

4902
02:43:48,079 --> 02:43:52,639
what should the assayer do he or she

4903
02:43:50,719 --> 02:43:54,478
should look at these theories look what

4904
02:43:52,639 --> 02:43:56,559
things they explain that already exist

4905
02:43:54,478 --> 02:43:57,358
and look at what new predictions they

4906
02:43:56,559 --> 02:43:59,600
can

4907
02:43:57,359 --> 02:44:01,920
claim to explain if we can build

4908
02:43:59,600 --> 02:44:03,200
experiments to ch to test them so you

4909
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:06,000
have to kind of challenge yourself to

4910
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:08,159
think about what kind of predictions

4911
02:44:06,000 --> 02:44:10,879
can they make such that we can construct

4912
02:44:08,159 --> 02:44:13,439
experiments so that's like ultimately

4913
02:44:10,879 --> 02:44:16,039
back going to this

4914
02:44:13,439 --> 02:44:18,559
to the signal to the

4915
02:44:16,040 --> 02:44:21,200
experimenters theorists essentially

4916
02:44:18,559 --> 02:44:22,879
that's right so like very experiment

4917
02:44:21,200 --> 02:44:25,439
centric

4918
02:44:22,879 --> 02:44:27,039
exploration of the fundamental theory of

4919
02:44:25,439 --> 02:44:29,680
everything that's right and the best

4920
02:44:27,040 --> 02:44:31,920
scientists the best physicists were both

4921
02:44:29,680 --> 02:44:33,680
experimentalists and theorists

4922
02:44:31,920 --> 02:44:34,879
or at least that they if they were

4923
02:44:33,680 --> 02:44:37,279
experimentalists they understood the

4924
02:44:34,879 --> 02:44:38,639
theory well enough to make predictions

4925
02:44:37,279 --> 02:44:40,800
or to explore the predictions and the

4926
02:44:38,639 --> 02:44:42,398
consequences of those predictions they

4927
02:44:40,799 --> 02:44:44,799
or if they were theorists they were like

4928
02:44:42,398 --> 02:44:47,039
galileo like einstein has patents for

4929
02:44:44,799 --> 02:44:48,398
things that he invented

4930
02:44:47,040 --> 02:44:50,720
and then you know some of his work led

4931
02:44:48,398 --> 02:44:52,559
to the laser and the mazer um so he had

4932
02:44:50,719 --> 02:44:54,639
practical it wasn't just pure airy fairy

4933
02:44:52,559 --> 02:44:57,278
you know quantum reality and expanding

4934
02:44:54,639 --> 02:44:58,879
universe um so in this case what i want

4935
02:44:57,279 --> 02:45:00,079
to do is look at you know there's 10

4936
02:44:58,879 --> 02:45:01,759
different theories of everything or

4937
02:45:00,079 --> 02:45:03,200
cosmological models they make

4938
02:45:01,760 --> 02:45:05,200
predictions they have advantages and

4939
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:06,960
disadvantages and i'm just asking the

4940
02:45:05,200 --> 02:45:09,040
question why aren't we applying bayesian

4941
02:45:06,959 --> 02:45:10,398
reasoning with confidence intervals why

4942
02:45:09,040 --> 02:45:11,840
don't we have updates every time an

4943
02:45:10,398 --> 02:45:13,358
experiment comes out

4944
02:45:11,840 --> 02:45:15,439
we can update our credulity in that

4945
02:45:13,359 --> 02:45:17,520
experiment or that theory rather based

4946
02:45:15,439 --> 02:45:19,200
on the results of the experiment and we

4947
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:20,800
shouldn't do it after the fact or as you

4948
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:22,880
know michio kaku has said

4949
02:45:20,799 --> 02:45:24,719
well you have to tell me what the

4950
02:45:22,879 --> 02:45:25,920
initial conditions are that's not my job

4951
02:45:24,719 --> 02:45:27,760
you're supposed to tell me if string

4952
02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:29,359
theory is correct what should it predict

4953
02:45:27,760 --> 02:45:30,960
if it's true

4954
02:45:29,359 --> 02:45:33,600
there's one big problem which i should

4955
02:45:30,959 --> 02:45:36,000
say that um to be a good

4956
02:45:33,600 --> 02:45:37,760
assayer i think you have to

4957
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:39,920
you have to be

4958
02:45:37,760 --> 02:45:41,520
worldly in the sense of

4959
02:45:39,920 --> 02:45:43,600
um worldly and curious like we were

4960
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:45,279
talking about before with with you and

4961
02:45:43,600 --> 02:45:47,600
joe and

4962
02:45:45,279 --> 02:45:50,319
you can't only talk your own book you

4963
02:45:47,600 --> 02:45:52,960
can't only understand your own pet

4964
02:45:50,318 --> 02:45:55,680
theory of everything um you can't only

4965
02:45:52,959 --> 02:45:57,919
say well i only understand string theory

4966
02:45:55,680 --> 02:45:59,920
and i don't have time for these other

4967
02:45:57,920 --> 02:46:02,079
theories or as if it's beneath me to

4968
02:45:59,920 --> 02:46:04,239
even under uh you know go into garrett

4969
02:46:02,079 --> 02:46:07,279
lisey or eric weinstein or stephen

4970
02:46:04,239 --> 02:46:09,279
wolfram or aspects of you know m theory

4971
02:46:07,279 --> 02:46:11,680
etc etc and there are some that say you

4972
02:46:09,279 --> 02:46:13,760
know like why do we give um you know

4973
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:16,318
string theory so much

4974
02:46:13,760 --> 02:46:18,000
um so much of an advanced pass when it

4975
02:46:16,318 --> 02:46:20,000
we they're actually predictions that's

4976
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:22,159
made that are completely anathema to

4977
02:46:20,000 --> 02:46:24,318
what we observe in physics like the dark

4978
02:46:22,159 --> 02:46:26,159
energy should be negative and we see it

4979
02:46:24,318 --> 02:46:27,840
as positive like that's a huge strike

4980
02:46:26,159 --> 02:46:29,119
you know if you told somebody here's my

4981
02:46:27,840 --> 02:46:30,478
10-year application and what do you

4982
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:32,880
think oh i've made this pretty if it

4983
02:46:30,478 --> 02:46:34,799
wasn't done by you know maldisana and

4984
02:46:32,879 --> 02:46:36,000
you know whitten and folks like that i

4985
02:46:34,799 --> 02:46:38,239
don't know if it would have had the

4986
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:40,000
traction the endurance the resiliency

4987
02:46:38,239 --> 02:46:41,039
that it's had and that worries me

4988
02:46:40,000 --> 02:46:43,279
because

4989
02:46:41,040 --> 02:46:45,200
all these men and some women are making

4990
02:46:43,279 --> 02:46:47,040
these fantastic brilliant beautiful

4991
02:46:45,200 --> 02:46:48,479
ideas and they're not even looking at

4992
02:46:47,040 --> 02:46:49,680
what their neighbors doing

4993
02:46:48,478 --> 02:46:51,438
there's a

4994
02:46:49,680 --> 02:46:53,359
thing that i really enjoyed

4995
02:46:51,439 --> 02:46:54,479
seeing and i don't see often enough with

4996
02:46:53,359 --> 02:46:58,159
these theories

4997
02:46:54,478 --> 02:47:00,559
which is others who are also experts

4998
02:46:58,159 --> 02:47:01,600
kind of uh studying them sufficiently

4999
02:47:00,559 --> 02:47:03,920
well

5000
02:47:01,600 --> 02:47:05,840
to steal man the theory

5001
02:47:03,920 --> 02:47:07,359
to show the beautiful aspects of the

5002
02:47:05,840 --> 02:47:09,840
theory

5003
02:47:07,359 --> 02:47:13,040
you know i see that with stephen wolfram

5004
02:47:09,840 --> 02:47:15,359
he has a a very different uh

5005
02:47:13,040 --> 02:47:17,040
sort of formulation of physics with his

5006
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:18,399
physics project

5007
02:47:17,040 --> 02:47:20,880
now i'm

5008
02:47:18,398 --> 02:47:22,559
it's you know physics is a foreign land

5009
02:47:20,879 --> 02:47:24,239
to me but uh

5010
02:47:22,559 --> 02:47:25,600
his formulation especially in the

5011
02:47:24,239 --> 02:47:26,959
context of cellular automate our

5012
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:29,279
hypographs

5013
02:47:26,959 --> 02:47:31,438
just as objects as mathematical objects

5014
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:33,760
themselves are familiar and so i'm able

5015
02:47:31,439 --> 02:47:35,279
to see the the real beauty there and it

5016
02:47:33,760 --> 02:47:36,079
saddens me

5017
02:47:35,279 --> 02:47:37,760
that

5018
02:47:36,079 --> 02:47:39,920
others

5019
02:47:37,760 --> 02:47:41,120
in the physics community can't also see

5020
02:47:39,920 --> 02:47:43,520
the beauty

5021
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:45,439
like give it a chance give a chance to

5022
02:47:43,520 --> 02:47:47,680
see the beauty and then your respect

5023
02:47:45,439 --> 02:47:49,680
right so there is one person who does

5024
02:47:47,680 --> 02:47:51,600
take time and is

5025
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:53,760
what i consider to be a great scientist

5026
02:47:51,600 --> 02:47:55,680
in terms of what he thinks he obviously

5027
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:56,960
has invested interest in his own theory

5028
02:47:55,680 --> 02:47:58,000
and it's eric

5029
02:47:56,959 --> 02:48:00,478
eric's

5030
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:03,760
got a truly encyclopedic knowledge of

5031
02:48:00,478 --> 02:48:06,398
the history of physics and he has a

5032
02:48:03,760 --> 02:48:07,359
great warmth and graciousness when it

5033
02:48:06,398 --> 02:48:08,879
comes to

5034
02:48:07,359 --> 02:48:10,720
giving others and i've witnessed this

5035
02:48:08,879 --> 02:48:12,398
and i've had look first of all i think

5036
02:48:10,719 --> 02:48:14,239
debate is pointless like i don't know

5037
02:48:12,398 --> 02:48:15,840
about you but if you've ever voted like

5038
02:48:14,239 --> 02:48:17,760
oh i saw this debate and you know

5039
02:48:15,840 --> 02:48:19,359
because trump did so badly and i'm going

5040
02:48:17,760 --> 02:48:21,200
to vote for but no it never happened you

5041
02:48:19,359 --> 02:48:23,520
almost never change anybody's mind

5042
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:24,319
unless you debate with love unless you

5043
02:48:23,520 --> 02:48:26,640
have

5044
02:48:24,318 --> 02:48:27,920
almost like we're going to win together

5045
02:48:26,639 --> 02:48:30,478
like the red team approach in the

5046
02:48:27,920 --> 02:48:32,398
military they're trying to win a war so

5047
02:48:30,478 --> 02:48:34,398
they may disagree on this on the tactics

5048
02:48:32,398 --> 02:48:36,239
day-to-day but the strategy we have to

5049
02:48:34,398 --> 02:48:37,519
win this war i love you and i want to

5050
02:48:36,239 --> 02:48:39,119
protect you

5051
02:48:37,520 --> 02:48:41,279
i don't see that in very many of these

5052
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:42,800
physicists from kaku i almost see it

5053
02:48:41,279 --> 02:48:44,560
it's embarrassing in some ways because

5054
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:46,478
they'll they'll almost mock with the

5055
02:48:44,559 --> 02:48:48,159
exception of eric you know garrett's

5056
02:48:46,478 --> 02:48:50,318
interesting you know his theory is you

5057
02:48:48,159 --> 02:48:53,039
know people have a lot of issues very

5058
02:48:50,318 --> 02:48:55,278
technical uh but eric has taken the time

5059
02:48:53,040 --> 02:48:56,720
to try to understand it eric has taken

5060
02:48:55,279 --> 02:48:59,279
the time to understand peter white's

5061
02:48:56,719 --> 02:49:01,039
theory and i i don't see i don't see the

5062
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:02,159
same graciousness extended from them i'm

5063
02:49:01,040 --> 02:49:03,680
sorry yeah

5064
02:49:02,159 --> 02:49:06,079
you're right you're right i mean with

5065
02:49:03,680 --> 02:49:07,439
eric he hasn't he he wants to but he

5066
02:49:06,079 --> 02:49:09,760
hasn't extended the same for stephen

5067
02:49:07,439 --> 02:49:11,760
wolfram because i think

5068
02:49:09,760 --> 02:49:13,600
no he did no actually no he did i had a

5069
02:49:11,760 --> 02:49:15,279
debate with them live on my show no i

5070
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:17,439
did i listened to it but like i just

5071
02:49:15,279 --> 02:49:19,279
think it's outside of the toolkit oh

5072
02:49:17,439 --> 02:49:21,760
that eric is comfortable with so it's

5073
02:49:19,279 --> 02:49:24,840
not it's not that he's not but you're

5074
02:49:21,760 --> 02:49:28,318
the main thing that's often absent and

5075
02:49:24,840 --> 02:49:30,159
eric does have is like the willingness

5076
02:49:28,318 --> 02:49:32,239
and like not just like dismissing or

5077
02:49:30,159 --> 02:49:34,639
mocking the that he's he's reaching out

5078
02:49:32,239 --> 02:49:35,920
but okay i mean what if it's not

5079
02:49:34,639 --> 02:49:37,278
you know i made a joke when they were on

5080
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:38,478
i was like how many theories of

5081
02:49:37,279 --> 02:49:40,239
everything can there be you know

5082
02:49:38,478 --> 02:49:42,478
highlander you know there can be only

5083
02:49:40,239 --> 02:49:44,559
one you know i don't know maybe but he

5084
02:49:42,478 --> 02:49:47,039
of course also like the other folks who

5085
02:49:44,559 --> 02:49:49,760
propose a theory has um

5086
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:52,720
in ego yeah

5087
02:49:49,760 --> 02:49:55,359
he uh he rides a dragon

5088
02:49:52,719 --> 02:49:57,199
the dragon representing the ego

5089
02:49:55,359 --> 02:50:00,000
well let me ask you about

5090
02:49:57,200 --> 02:50:01,760
your friend eric weinstein

5091
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:03,359
so he proposed initial sketches of

5092
02:50:01,760 --> 02:50:05,279
geometric community

5093
02:50:03,359 --> 02:50:07,760
which is his theory of everything maybe

5094
02:50:05,279 --> 02:50:10,159
you can elucidate some aspect of it that

5095
02:50:07,760 --> 02:50:11,920
you find interesting but

5096
02:50:10,159 --> 02:50:14,639
um

5097
02:50:11,920 --> 02:50:17,600
what do you think about the response he

5098
02:50:14,639 --> 02:50:19,278
got from the scientific community

5099
02:50:17,600 --> 02:50:20,800
well you know some of the response came

5100
02:50:19,279 --> 02:50:23,680
from people

5101
02:50:20,799 --> 02:50:25,679
academicians professors some came from a

5102
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:27,520
lay audience and some came from

5103
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:29,920
trained scientists or no longer you know

5104
02:50:27,520 --> 02:50:31,520
maybe practicing in universities

5105
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:33,760
um i thought it was

5106
02:50:31,520 --> 02:50:36,800
there was a lot of vitriol which

5107
02:50:33,760 --> 02:50:38,079
surprised me because i look at what he's

5108
02:50:36,799 --> 02:50:38,959
trying to do

5109
02:50:38,079 --> 02:50:41,200
and

5110
02:50:38,959 --> 02:50:43,919
it was always the vitriol would always

5111
02:50:41,200 --> 02:50:45,920
come with some element of ad hominem um

5112
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:48,318
and maybe that's his personality maybe

5113
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:50,639
that engenders this or whatever maybe

5114
02:50:48,318 --> 02:50:51,920
there is kind of just a natural tendency

5115
02:50:50,639 --> 02:50:53,358
you know i always get these emails

5116
02:50:51,920 --> 02:50:55,120
professor keating

5117
02:50:53,359 --> 02:50:56,960
um i have a new theory einstein was

5118
02:50:55,120 --> 02:50:59,760
wrong i'm going to prove it i'm not good

5119
02:50:56,959 --> 02:51:01,519
at math but if you help me i will share

5120
02:50:59,760 --> 02:51:02,800
my nobel prize with you

5121
02:51:01,520 --> 02:51:05,359
oh thank you have you read my books you

5122
02:51:02,799 --> 02:51:07,438
know um in other words it's always

5123
02:51:05,359 --> 02:51:09,200
taking down taking down the dragon it's

5124
02:51:07,439 --> 02:51:11,200
always taking down the kung fu master

5125
02:51:09,200 --> 02:51:12,560
right that you get the hit points from d

5126
02:51:11,200 --> 02:51:13,920
and d you get their hit ones you take

5127
02:51:12,559 --> 02:51:15,359
their cards you get their risk tokens

5128
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:16,879
from kamchatka

5129
02:51:15,359 --> 02:51:18,960
and thinking about

5130
02:51:16,879 --> 02:51:22,159
with eric it's like because what he's

5131
02:51:18,959 --> 02:51:23,679
doing is so aspirational it is grandiose

5132
02:51:22,159 --> 02:51:26,318
in a good sense what he's trying to do

5133
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:28,079
is is construct a geometric theory of

5134
02:51:26,318 --> 02:51:30,159
everything that has aspects of super

5135
02:51:28,079 --> 02:51:32,398
symmetry instead of stuff embedded in it

5136
02:51:30,159 --> 02:51:35,359
he's trying to meld that it has very

5137
02:51:32,398 --> 02:51:37,119
um unusual features in that it features

5138
02:51:35,359 --> 02:51:39,279
not only multiple spatial dimensions

5139
02:51:37,120 --> 02:51:42,720
multiple time dimensions it uses new

5140
02:51:39,279 --> 02:51:45,200
mathematical objects that he's invented

5141
02:51:42,719 --> 02:51:47,039
and look i had uh you know had him on my

5142
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:49,040
show i've talked with him we've had

5143
02:51:47,040 --> 02:51:50,800
consultations with other physicists you

5144
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:52,319
know where he'll come down and i have a

5145
02:51:50,799 --> 02:51:54,079
visitor's office and he comes down to

5146
02:51:52,318 --> 02:51:55,840
san diego sometimes and spends time

5147
02:51:54,079 --> 02:51:58,318
there and we talk with eminent

5148
02:51:55,840 --> 02:52:01,200
mathematicians and physicists um

5149
02:51:58,318 --> 02:52:02,478
eric's uh been out of the academic world

5150
02:52:01,200 --> 02:52:04,880
for a long time

5151
02:52:02,478 --> 02:52:07,278
and there is as i said before an aspect

5152
02:52:04,879 --> 02:52:09,039
of persuasion that must take place

5153
02:52:07,279 --> 02:52:12,079
in order to get anything through and i

5154
02:52:09,040 --> 02:52:14,399
think there was a slight amount of

5155
02:52:12,079 --> 02:52:16,719
good nature not ignorance naivete but

5156
02:52:14,398 --> 02:52:18,719
just the sense that if this is right

5157
02:52:16,719 --> 02:52:20,559
everyone will recognize it if you build

5158
02:52:18,719 --> 02:52:22,559
a better mousetrap the world will beat a

5159
02:52:20,559 --> 02:52:24,159
path to your door as the expression goes

5160
02:52:22,559 --> 02:52:25,278
that's completely untrue that almost

5161
02:52:24,159 --> 02:52:26,478
that doesn't even happen with mouse

5162
02:52:25,279 --> 02:52:28,479
traps i mean you know how many freaking

5163
02:52:26,478 --> 02:52:30,079
mousetrap types there are it's like

5164
02:52:28,478 --> 02:52:32,000
no they don't beat a path here you have

5165
02:52:30,079 --> 02:52:34,959
to sell that freaking thing you have to

5166
02:52:32,000 --> 02:52:37,120
sell it like steve jobs or elon you i

5167
02:52:34,959 --> 02:52:38,719
have never i've had one paper out of 200

5168
02:52:37,120 --> 02:52:40,800
papers i've published in peer-reviewed

5169
02:52:38,719 --> 02:52:43,039
journals i've only had one half a

5170
02:52:40,799 --> 02:52:44,879
percent published with no referees

5171
02:52:43,040 --> 02:52:46,319
comments in other words published like

5172
02:52:44,879 --> 02:52:47,920
dream submitted it probably it happened

5173
02:52:46,318 --> 02:52:49,840
to be an appreciative journal i was

5174
02:52:47,920 --> 02:52:51,520
pretty psyched about that but you almost

5175
02:52:49,840 --> 02:52:53,120
have to crave the response getting it

5176
02:52:51,520 --> 02:52:54,399
back from a journal and i think he

5177
02:52:53,120 --> 02:52:56,399
doesn't see first of all he doesn't

5178
02:52:54,398 --> 02:52:58,478
subscribe to the peer review process he

5179
02:52:56,398 --> 02:53:00,879
thinks that is anathema to the way

5180
02:52:58,478 --> 02:53:03,199
science is at best interest in public in

5181
02:53:00,879 --> 02:53:05,679
journals etc etc

5182
02:53:03,200 --> 02:53:08,640
i think you can have elements of peer

5183
02:53:05,680 --> 02:53:09,840
review that are substantive and valuable

5184
02:53:08,639 --> 02:53:12,079
i think you have to learn from your

5185
02:53:09,840 --> 02:53:13,600
critics one of my conversations with

5186
02:53:12,079 --> 02:53:14,559
john mather he talks about loving your

5187
02:53:13,600 --> 02:53:16,880
critics

5188
02:53:14,559 --> 02:53:18,559
in this book but not being so open to

5189
02:53:16,879 --> 02:53:21,039
their criticism that their criticism

5190
02:53:18,559 --> 02:53:22,719
goes to your heart and not being so open

5191
02:53:21,040 --> 02:53:24,560
to their compliments that their

5192
02:53:22,719 --> 02:53:26,879
compliments go to your head

5193
02:53:24,559 --> 02:53:29,519
it's a very tough scilla and charybdis

5194
02:53:26,879 --> 02:53:31,438
to walk well there's something i mean

5195
02:53:29,520 --> 02:53:34,560
i want to be careful here because i i'd

5196
02:53:31,439 --> 02:53:37,680
like to talk to eric about this

5197
02:53:34,559 --> 02:53:41,119
uh directly but i'll just

5198
02:53:37,680 --> 02:53:41,120
from a perspective of a friend

5199
02:53:41,200 --> 02:53:45,600
want to ask about

5200
02:53:42,799 --> 02:53:45,599
the um

5201
02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:52,000
the drug of fame

5202
02:53:48,398 --> 02:53:53,439
so there's also the public

5203
02:53:52,000 --> 02:53:56,719
uh

5204
02:53:53,439 --> 02:53:59,680
perception of the battles of physics and

5205
02:53:56,719 --> 02:54:00,879
so there's a very narrow community

5206
02:53:59,680 --> 02:54:02,880
but then there's the way that's

5207
02:54:00,879 --> 02:54:05,519
perceived

5208
02:54:02,879 --> 02:54:08,478
the exploration of ideas is perceived by

5209
02:54:05,520 --> 02:54:10,960
the public and so there is a cert

5210
02:54:08,478 --> 02:54:12,959
certain drug to the excitement that the

5211
02:54:10,959 --> 02:54:14,879
public can show

5212
02:54:12,959 --> 02:54:16,879
when they sense that you have something

5213
02:54:14,879 --> 02:54:19,599
big

5214
02:54:16,879 --> 02:54:22,318
and that in itself

5215
02:54:19,600 --> 02:54:23,600
might become the thing that gives you

5216
02:54:22,318 --> 02:54:25,840
pleasure

5217
02:54:23,600 --> 02:54:27,760
and um

5218
02:54:25,840 --> 02:54:29,520
i think that with theories of everything

5219
02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:31,920
or with any kind of super super

5220
02:54:29,520 --> 02:54:33,120
ambitious projects and this is taking us

5221
02:54:31,920 --> 02:54:35,279
back to

5222
02:54:33,120 --> 02:54:37,680
when you were ambitious about trying to

5223
02:54:35,279 --> 02:54:40,399
understand the origins of the universe

5224
02:54:37,680 --> 02:54:42,479
if you convince yourself that you have

5225
02:54:40,398 --> 02:54:43,680
an intuition about the origins of the

5226
02:54:42,478 --> 02:54:47,358
universe

5227
02:54:43,680 --> 02:54:48,398
and you have a platform like you do now

5228
02:54:47,359 --> 02:54:51,120
where you

5229
02:54:48,398 --> 02:54:52,879
start to communicate your intuition it's

5230
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:55,439
it's it's hazy like all the science

5231
02:54:52,879 --> 02:54:56,879
you're still unsure but you have a sense

5232
02:54:55,439 --> 02:54:58,800
i mean perhaps you don't have that as

5233
02:54:56,879 --> 02:55:00,799
much as an experimentalist because you

5234
02:54:58,799 --> 02:55:03,840
always kind of start going okay how do

5235
02:55:00,799 --> 02:55:04,799
can of build a device that to me to see

5236
02:55:03,840 --> 02:55:06,799
through the

5237
02:55:04,799 --> 02:55:10,079
through the fog but if you're more like

5238
02:55:06,799 --> 02:55:12,000
a theoretician who kind of works in the

5239
02:55:10,079 --> 02:55:13,439
realm of ideas in the realm of

5240
02:55:12,000 --> 02:55:14,719
intuitions

5241
02:55:13,439 --> 02:55:16,800
it's uh

5242
02:55:14,719 --> 02:55:18,318
it is also a source of pleasure you

5243
02:55:16,799 --> 02:55:20,079
mentioned dopamine

5244
02:55:18,318 --> 02:55:23,439
a source of dopamine

5245
02:55:20,079 --> 02:55:25,120
that you can communicate to others

5246
02:55:23,439 --> 02:55:27,120
that you're really excited by the

5247
02:55:25,120 --> 02:55:29,520
possibility of solving the deepest

5248
02:55:27,120 --> 02:55:30,800
mysteries of the universe

5249
02:55:29,520 --> 02:55:33,279
so there's some

5250
02:55:30,799 --> 02:55:36,239
aspect to which you want to be a uh

5251
02:55:33,279 --> 02:55:38,399
grigori grisha pearlman and go into the

5252
02:55:36,239 --> 02:55:40,879
hole and get the work done

5253
02:55:38,398 --> 02:55:42,799
and shut the hell up about the let me

5254
02:55:40,879 --> 02:55:45,358
speak about myself about

5255
02:55:42,799 --> 02:55:48,000
you know talking about the dream and

5256
02:55:45,359 --> 02:55:50,479
planning and exploring how great it will

5257
02:55:48,000 --> 02:55:52,398
be if my intuition turns out to be

5258
02:55:50,478 --> 02:55:55,278
correct that's right

5259
02:55:52,398 --> 02:55:57,199
the sketches i have turn out to actually

5260
02:55:55,279 --> 02:55:58,479
build the bridge that takes us to a

5261
02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:01,040
whole new place

5262
02:55:58,478 --> 02:56:03,679
as a friend of eric's

5263
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:05,359
or a friend of um

5264
02:56:03,680 --> 02:56:07,120
or my friend

5265
02:56:05,359 --> 02:56:10,159
what kind of

5266
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:12,640
advice do you give what is your role is

5267
02:56:10,159 --> 02:56:14,159
it to be a supporter given that he has

5268
02:56:12,639 --> 02:56:17,599
many critics

5269
02:56:14,159 --> 02:56:19,760
or is it to be in private

5270
02:56:17,600 --> 02:56:22,000
um a critic like a lot of my friends

5271
02:56:19,760 --> 02:56:23,279
will say hey shut the hell up

5272
02:56:22,000 --> 02:56:24,879
just get it done well first of all i

5273
02:56:23,279 --> 02:56:27,680
want to ask you a question i've asked

5274
02:56:24,879 --> 02:56:29,358
him and then it comes from uh animal

5275
02:56:27,680 --> 02:56:31,520
farm by uh

5276
02:56:29,359 --> 02:56:33,439
my probably my favorite book yeah so you

5277
02:56:31,520 --> 02:56:34,960
remember benjamin the donkey yes and

5278
02:56:33,439 --> 02:56:36,559
he's talking to the pig

5279
02:56:34,959 --> 02:56:38,000
i forget the pig's name you probably

5280
02:56:36,559 --> 02:56:41,119
know anyway the pig says to him you've

5281
02:56:38,000 --> 02:56:43,520
got this long lustrous beautiful tail

5282
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:46,319
you're so lucky i got this short curly

5283
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:47,520
little squiggly thing does jack squat

5284
02:56:46,318 --> 02:56:49,119
tell me

5285
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:51,279
how does it feel to have such a lustrous

5286
02:56:49,120 --> 02:56:55,040
tail and benjamin says well the good

5287
02:56:51,279 --> 02:56:57,200
lord he gave me a tail to swat away the

5288
02:56:55,040 --> 02:56:59,680
flies but you know what

5289
02:56:57,200 --> 02:57:02,560
i'd rather not have the tail

5290
02:56:59,680 --> 02:57:04,239
if i didn't have the flies so i ask you

5291
02:57:02,559 --> 02:57:05,680
as i've asked eric

5292
02:57:04,239 --> 02:57:07,199
is it worth it

5293
02:57:05,680 --> 02:57:09,840
you know you've got these you've got

5294
02:57:07,200 --> 02:57:11,279
these beautiful tail but there are flies

5295
02:57:09,840 --> 02:57:13,520
i'm not saying in a negative way i'm

5296
02:57:11,279 --> 02:57:16,079
just saying you get unwanted

5297
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:18,319
distractions dopamine you know it's kind

5298
02:57:16,079 --> 02:57:20,559
of the highlight the spotlight

5299
02:57:18,318 --> 02:57:22,478
effect it's obviously allowing you to do

5300
02:57:20,559 --> 02:57:23,760
things that you could never do alone and

5301
02:57:22,478 --> 02:57:25,199
i think

5302
02:57:23,760 --> 02:57:26,398
you know first of all i'd love to know

5303
02:57:25,200 --> 02:57:28,640
how you answer that because that's

5304
02:57:26,398 --> 02:57:30,159
something i don't feel i can relate to

5305
02:57:28,639 --> 02:57:33,439
myself

5306
02:57:30,159 --> 02:57:36,719
well this has to do with more like

5307
02:57:33,439 --> 02:57:39,760
platforms platform stuff yeah scale

5308
02:57:36,719 --> 02:57:42,879
oh i um

5309
02:57:39,760 --> 02:57:45,200
that has no very little effect on me i i

5310
02:57:42,879 --> 02:57:46,959
enjoy it

5311
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:48,960
i enjoy meeting new people but that has

5312
02:57:46,959 --> 02:57:50,639
nothing to do with platform yeah no that

5313
02:57:48,959 --> 02:57:51,599
has no effect on me

5314
02:57:50,639 --> 02:57:55,599
um

5315
02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:58,318
do i want somebody that enjoys

5316
02:57:55,600 --> 02:58:00,159
the act itself so this conversation the

5317
02:57:58,318 --> 02:58:01,119
reason i'm doing this podcast with you

5318
02:58:00,159 --> 02:58:02,079
today

5319
02:58:01,120 --> 02:58:03,920
is

5320
02:58:02,079 --> 02:58:05,359
because it allows me to trick you into

5321
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:07,040
talking to me for a prolonged period of

5322
02:58:05,359 --> 02:58:08,960
time i don't care about platforms i

5323
02:58:07,040 --> 02:58:09,760
assume nobody listens it really doesn't

5324
02:58:08,959 --> 02:58:12,000
matter

5325
02:58:09,760 --> 02:58:13,680
yeah if it got it right my whole test of

5326
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:15,359
it was a good podcast because how do you

5327
02:58:13,680 --> 02:58:17,279
know like podcast been around what 12

5328
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:18,960
years how do we know as podcasters were

5329
02:58:17,279 --> 02:58:20,159
doing a good job like sometimes someone

5330
02:58:18,959 --> 02:58:21,438
said that was the best interview i ever

5331
02:58:20,159 --> 02:58:23,279
had but that doesn't happen that often

5332
02:58:21,439 --> 02:58:25,520
at least for me but

5333
02:58:23,279 --> 02:58:28,079
if you realize that you forgot to put

5334
02:58:25,520 --> 02:58:30,319
the sd card in that little guy and the

5335
02:58:28,079 --> 02:58:32,159
zoom didn't work would you do it again

5336
02:58:30,318 --> 02:58:34,159
and i think if you say yes to that that

5337
02:58:32,159 --> 02:58:35,760
was a good podcast yeah exactly that's

5338
02:58:34,159 --> 02:58:36,719
that's exactly it so

5339
02:58:35,760 --> 02:58:39,439
in that

5340
02:58:36,719 --> 02:58:42,000
in that space yeah um

5341
02:58:39,439 --> 02:58:46,239
all of it is worth it yeah but

5342
02:58:42,000 --> 02:58:48,239
but the dream the the i'm more referring

5343
02:58:46,239 --> 02:58:50,318
to the psychological effects forget the

5344
02:58:48,239 --> 02:58:51,840
platform forget all that

5345
02:58:50,318 --> 02:58:53,439
you know i maybe shouldn't even brought

5346
02:58:51,840 --> 02:58:56,000
up the platform because it really has to

5347
02:58:53,439 --> 02:58:58,960
do even in your own private mind which

5348
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:59,760
is what i'm struggling with

5349
02:58:58,959 --> 02:59:03,519
i

5350
02:58:59,760 --> 02:59:06,079
enjoy the planning the dreaming

5351
02:59:03,520 --> 02:59:07,200
the early stages

5352
02:59:06,079 --> 02:59:08,398
um

5353
02:59:07,200 --> 02:59:09,200
so much

5354
02:59:08,398 --> 02:59:11,039
that

5355
02:59:09,200 --> 02:59:13,040
i often don't take projects to

5356
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:14,399
completion this is a

5357
02:59:13,040 --> 02:59:16,479
psychological effect that i'm sure

5358
02:59:14,398 --> 02:59:18,478
basically everybody every engineer

5359
02:59:16,478 --> 02:59:19,920
everybody that does anything goes

5360
02:59:18,478 --> 02:59:22,239
through i just uh

5361
02:59:19,920 --> 02:59:24,318
in this case particular i think it also

5362
02:59:22,239 --> 02:59:25,359
applies and i wonder as a friend what is

5363
02:59:24,318 --> 02:59:26,959
the role

5364
02:59:25,359 --> 02:59:28,479
so yeah i mean that effect has been

5365
02:59:26,959 --> 02:59:30,239
documented everything from you know

5366
02:59:28,478 --> 02:59:32,639
planning telescopes to dieting so

5367
02:59:30,239 --> 02:59:33,920
there's a there's a tiny bit of dopamine

5368
02:59:32,639 --> 02:59:36,000
that you get

5369
02:59:33,920 --> 02:59:37,439
visualizing how you're going to feel you

5370
02:59:36,000 --> 02:59:39,520
don't need to know this but you know you

5371
02:59:37,439 --> 02:59:41,200
don't deal but losing five pounds i said

5372
02:59:39,520 --> 02:59:42,479
i'm gonna lose five pounds and i'm gonna

5373
02:59:41,200 --> 02:59:44,479
be able to do run you know a minute

5374
02:59:42,478 --> 02:59:46,478
faster so there's a part of me when i'm

5375
02:59:44,478 --> 02:59:48,559
planning the diet and the meals and the

5376
02:59:46,478 --> 02:59:50,478
exercise that i get a little bit of that

5377
02:59:48,559 --> 02:59:51,680
thrill and that actually saps a little

5378
02:59:50,478 --> 02:59:53,278
bit of my willpower to actually complete

5379
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:54,800
the task that will take me to that goal

5380
02:59:53,279 --> 02:59:57,040
so that's a documented effect and that

5381
02:59:54,799 --> 02:59:59,119
happens in um and project planning and

5382
02:59:57,040 --> 03:00:00,720
project management it's a very very

5383
02:59:59,120 --> 03:00:02,399
important thing to guard against as a

5384
03:00:00,719 --> 03:00:04,559
manager of a big project

5385
03:00:02,398 --> 03:00:06,799
with eric it's interesting because with

5386
03:00:04,559 --> 03:00:08,799
him uh first of all we you know we

5387
03:00:06,799 --> 03:00:11,840
relate extremely well you know on a

5388
03:00:08,799 --> 03:00:14,079
friendship level and uh very close he

5389
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:15,920
does remind me a lot of my father

5390
03:00:14,079 --> 03:00:18,719
and i i've told him that you know just

5391
03:00:15,920 --> 03:00:21,040
as a mathematician as a big thinker

5392
03:00:18,719 --> 03:00:22,719
as you know in his case as a father you

5393
03:00:21,040 --> 03:00:25,920
know the father kind of figure that i

5394
03:00:22,719 --> 03:00:27,599
didn't have in a sense but that he is he

5395
03:00:25,920 --> 03:00:29,760
is a true lover of life he knows he's

5396
03:00:27,600 --> 03:00:31,680
got a huge platform he knows he gets a

5397
03:00:29,760 --> 03:00:34,159
lot of attention for what he does

5398
03:00:31,680 --> 03:00:35,920
um and you know i jokingly say well it's

5399
03:00:34,159 --> 03:00:37,359
one thing like how do you know lex that

5400
03:00:35,920 --> 03:00:38,879
someone's an expert

5401
03:00:37,359 --> 03:00:40,399
the experts say

5402
03:00:38,879 --> 03:00:42,159
there's a good rule ray dalio writes

5403
03:00:40,398 --> 03:00:43,760
about in principles he says an expert is

5404
03:00:42,159 --> 03:00:46,000
someone who's done something three times

5405
03:00:43,760 --> 03:00:47,439
successfully like you can do one

5406
03:00:46,000 --> 03:00:48,959
something correctly once you could do

5407
03:00:47,439 --> 03:00:51,279
something correctly it's very hard to

5408
03:00:48,959 --> 03:00:52,478
pull off like three projects three

5409
03:00:51,279 --> 03:00:55,439
telescopes

5410
03:00:52,478 --> 03:00:57,278
three whatever right so um so look for

5411
03:00:55,439 --> 03:00:59,279
uh it's arbitrary could be four it could

5412
03:00:57,279 --> 03:01:00,560
be two right but the point is look at

5413
03:00:59,279 --> 03:01:03,120
eric so how many things has he

5414
03:01:00,559 --> 03:01:05,680
contributed to and made you know pretty

5415
03:01:03,120 --> 03:01:07,279
substantive kind of uh paradigm shifts

5416
03:01:05,680 --> 03:01:09,600
for different people i would say he's

5417
03:01:07,279 --> 03:01:11,520
been right many times does that mean

5418
03:01:09,600 --> 03:01:13,760
he's infallible that he's ineffable no

5419
03:01:11,520 --> 03:01:16,640
of course not for me so what i'm saying

5420
03:01:13,760 --> 03:01:18,960
is i get a little bit of the joy of kind

5421
03:01:16,639 --> 03:01:21,119
of learning something purely

5422
03:01:18,959 --> 03:01:23,519
as a as a scientist something completely

5423
03:01:21,120 --> 03:01:27,840
outside of what i do mathematics

5424
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:30,239
gage theory um the the kind of very um

5425
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:31,680
very advanced geometry topology that

5426
03:01:30,239 --> 03:01:34,398
he's interested in

5427
03:01:31,680 --> 03:01:36,079
but every now and then i will sneak in

5428
03:01:34,398 --> 03:01:37,039
that i want you know i've told him i'm

5429
03:01:36,079 --> 03:01:38,559
going to turn your son into an

5430
03:01:37,040 --> 03:01:40,319
experimentalist despite you you know

5431
03:01:38,559 --> 03:01:41,519
like he is not going to be a theater zev

5432
03:01:40,318 --> 03:01:43,039
is not going to be a therapist he is

5433
03:01:41,520 --> 03:01:45,040
working with me he is learning from me

5434
03:01:43,040 --> 03:01:47,040
it is we're trying to get him into he

5435
03:01:45,040 --> 03:01:48,720
wants to bypass all of the you know kind

5436
03:01:47,040 --> 03:01:50,319
of nonsense of undergraduate and go

5437
03:01:48,719 --> 03:01:52,159
straight to graduate school and i've

5438
03:01:50,318 --> 03:01:53,680
tried to encourage him that maybe he

5439
03:01:52,159 --> 03:01:55,760
could do it maybe he can't but there's

5440
03:01:53,680 --> 03:01:57,600
no other way than to try and so we've

5441
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:59,520
i've prepared a whole curriculum for zev

5442
03:01:57,600 --> 03:02:01,600
to basically bypass all of undergraduate

5443
03:01:59,520 --> 03:02:03,520
and to his credit he he's earns all the

5444
03:02:01,600 --> 03:02:05,359
credit he's learned it to a level that

5445
03:02:03,520 --> 03:02:07,520
matches many of my graduates okay hold

5446
03:02:05,359 --> 03:02:09,680
on a second i have to push back and this

5447
03:02:07,520 --> 03:02:11,520
is me saying it and i'll yeah i'm sure

5448
03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:12,880
i'll talk to eric about this

5449
03:02:11,520 --> 03:02:14,239
but to say

5450
03:02:12,879 --> 03:02:15,599
you said

5451
03:02:14,239 --> 03:02:17,920
eric's done

5452
03:02:15,600 --> 03:02:19,200
was right on multiple

5453
03:02:17,920 --> 03:02:21,840
things

5454
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:23,760
i think eric has a

5455
03:02:21,840 --> 03:02:26,398
great deep

5456
03:02:23,760 --> 03:02:29,120
insight about human nature and how

5457
03:02:26,398 --> 03:02:31,519
societies work and he says a lot of wise

5458
03:02:29,120 --> 03:02:33,680
words on that world

5459
03:02:31,520 --> 03:02:35,920
but i think if we're talking about

5460
03:02:33,680 --> 03:02:37,200
experts you kind of have to prove you

5461
03:02:35,920 --> 03:02:38,478
know it's like michael jordan playing

5462
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:40,319
baseball

5463
03:02:38,478 --> 03:02:41,920
like he's proved it many times that he

5464
03:02:40,318 --> 03:02:43,600
can play basketball

5465
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:45,920
but he's also got to prove that he can

5466
03:02:43,600 --> 03:02:49,600
play baseball and i would say the whole

5467
03:02:45,920 --> 03:02:51,279
point of i mean of radical ideas

5468
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:53,920
is you're not

5469
03:02:51,279 --> 03:02:55,920
i mean it's very hard to be sitting on a

5470
03:02:53,920 --> 03:02:58,159
track record of i mean you're when

5471
03:02:55,920 --> 03:03:02,000
you're swinging for the is always you're

5472
03:02:58,159 --> 03:03:04,159
uh there's not a track record to sit on

5473
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:05,120
and uh like max tegmark is an example of

5474
03:03:04,159 --> 03:03:08,159
somebody

5475
03:03:05,120 --> 03:03:10,240
who has a huge track record of more like

5476
03:03:08,159 --> 03:03:12,079
acceptable stuff but he also keeps

5477
03:03:10,239 --> 03:03:14,719
swinging for the fences in every other

5478
03:03:12,079 --> 03:03:16,719
world so he has that track character

5479
03:03:14,719 --> 03:03:18,398
with eric if you look at just the number

5480
03:03:16,719 --> 03:03:20,639
of publications all this stuff he did

5481
03:03:18,398 --> 03:03:23,680
really he chose not to travel the

5482
03:03:20,639 --> 03:03:28,318
academic cross so there's no proof of

5483
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:30,800
expertise except sort of an obvious

5484
03:03:28,318 --> 03:03:32,719
linguistic demonstration of brilliance

5485
03:03:30,799 --> 03:03:34,559
but that's not how physics works

5486
03:03:32,719 --> 03:03:36,879
there's a polite way to damn somebody as

5487
03:03:34,559 --> 03:03:38,559
a scientist and say he or she

5488
03:03:36,879 --> 03:03:41,119
they really know the history of physics

5489
03:03:38,559 --> 03:03:42,559
very well like this is always lovely

5490
03:03:41,120 --> 03:03:43,840
like sean carr always jokes about like

5491
03:03:42,559 --> 03:03:46,318
you know like physicists should never

5492
03:03:43,840 --> 03:03:48,398
talk about history or physique

5493
03:03:46,318 --> 03:03:50,719
but it's more than that so

5494
03:03:48,398 --> 03:03:53,599
eric has certainly contributed in

5495
03:03:50,719 --> 03:03:56,000
finance and finance specifically

5496
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:58,880
gauge theory and economics and um in

5497
03:03:56,000 --> 03:04:00,799
inflation dynamics in the nominations

5498
03:03:58,879 --> 03:04:02,239
hold on a second that's yet to be proven

5499
03:04:00,799 --> 03:04:03,039
he has a lot of

5500
03:04:02,239 --> 03:04:05,199
power

5501
03:04:03,040 --> 03:04:08,479
he's got calculus calculus proven i mean

5502
03:04:05,200 --> 03:04:11,120
he he has a gauge model for currency um

5503
03:04:08,478 --> 03:04:13,358
for currency uh uh exchanges between

5504
03:04:11,120 --> 03:04:15,840
different nations that is explanatory

5505
03:04:13,359 --> 03:04:17,439
not not it's not um you know is it is it

5506
03:04:15,840 --> 03:04:19,600
is this something in other words it's a

5507
03:04:17,439 --> 03:04:21,840
model and it's used for pedagogical

5508
03:04:19,600 --> 03:04:25,040
purposes and it might be okay but it's

5509
03:04:21,840 --> 03:04:27,279
unique to him i mean him and pia yes

5510
03:04:25,040 --> 03:04:29,680
it might be a powerful model

5511
03:04:27,279 --> 03:04:32,239
it might be one that's actually deserves

5512
03:04:29,680 --> 03:04:34,239
huge amount of applause and celebration

5513
03:04:32,239 --> 03:04:35,760
but does not yet receive that and that's

5514
03:04:34,239 --> 03:04:37,039
one of the things that eric talks about

5515
03:04:35,760 --> 03:04:39,359
it has not received the attention it

5516
03:04:37,040 --> 03:04:41,760
deserves but it has not yet received the

5517
03:04:39,359 --> 03:04:43,760
attention it deserves and so like the

5518
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:46,000
the proven expertise thing i mean

5519
03:04:43,760 --> 03:04:48,159
there's a lot of people that go to their

5520
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:50,398
grave without the recognition they

5521
03:04:48,159 --> 03:04:52,478
deserve and it's a tragedy

5522
03:04:50,398 --> 03:04:53,358
but the fact is

5523
03:04:52,478 --> 03:04:55,519
like

5524
03:04:53,359 --> 03:04:57,279
you have to fight for that recognition

5525
03:04:55,520 --> 03:04:58,560
the tragedy happens for a reason you

5526
03:04:57,279 --> 03:05:00,640
can't just say

5527
03:04:58,559 --> 03:05:02,398
this person is obviously brilliant and

5528
03:05:00,639 --> 03:05:04,398
therefore they deserve

5529
03:05:02,398 --> 03:05:07,199
the credit um

5530
03:05:04,398 --> 03:05:09,278
uh in every single domain it doesn't it

5531
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:10,880
doesn't like transfer immediately

5532
03:05:09,279 --> 03:05:12,720
there's nobody that's well at least i

5533
03:05:10,879 --> 03:05:16,000
wouldn't argue eric is one of the

5534
03:05:12,719 --> 03:05:18,639
special minds in our generation but you

5535
03:05:16,000 --> 03:05:20,879
still have to fight the fight of physics

5536
03:05:18,639 --> 03:05:22,799
and prove it within the community and i

5537
03:05:20,879 --> 03:05:25,599
think the same applies in economics you

5538
03:05:22,799 --> 03:05:28,559
can't i mean as somebody

5539
03:05:25,600 --> 03:05:29,920
that uh you know i've i've gone through

5540
03:05:28,559 --> 03:05:32,639
the academic

5541
03:05:29,920 --> 03:05:35,120
journey just like you said the peer

5542
03:05:32,639 --> 03:05:37,439
review all of those things flawed as

5543
03:05:35,120 --> 03:05:40,000
they are that's the part of the process

5544
03:05:37,439 --> 03:05:42,639
you have to convince your peers the

5545
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:44,478
um the people that are as obsessed for

5546
03:05:42,639 --> 03:05:46,639
whatever the hell reason about that

5547
03:05:44,478 --> 03:05:49,119
particular thing that you're working on

5548
03:05:46,639 --> 03:05:51,358
yes there's egos yes there's politics

5549
03:05:49,120 --> 03:05:52,800
it's a giant mess but i think it's a

5550
03:05:51,359 --> 03:05:56,159
beautiful mess

5551
03:05:52,799 --> 03:05:56,819
through which you have to go through in

5552
03:05:56,159 --> 03:05:58,478
order to

5553
03:05:56,819 --> 03:06:00,559
[Music]

5554
03:05:58,478 --> 03:06:02,639
reveal the power of your idea to

5555
03:06:00,559 --> 03:06:04,639
yourself and to the world well let me

5556
03:06:02,639 --> 03:06:07,039
use an example so um you know of james

5557
03:06:04,639 --> 03:06:08,959
clerk maxwell and he invented the laws

5558
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:11,040
of electromagnetism which is the first

5559
03:06:08,959 --> 03:06:12,799
example of a unification principle ever

5560
03:06:11,040 --> 03:06:16,319
displayed by the human mind in history

5561
03:06:12,799 --> 03:06:18,079
math purely mathematics um unifying

5562
03:06:16,318 --> 03:06:20,478
completely disparate phenomena in one

5563
03:06:18,079 --> 03:06:22,159
case electricity charges static

5564
03:06:20,478 --> 03:06:24,959
electricity lightning and the other

5565
03:06:22,159 --> 03:06:27,200
magnets bar magnets currents etc unify

5566
03:06:24,959 --> 03:06:28,639
them you know what he did

5567
03:06:27,200 --> 03:06:31,359
i like to do a thought experiment

5568
03:06:28,639 --> 03:06:32,959
imagine twitter exists 1864. maxwell's

5569
03:06:31,359 --> 03:06:35,680
working away and he goes i have this

5570
03:06:32,959 --> 03:06:37,919
wonderful idea with fluctions and and uh

5571
03:06:35,680 --> 03:06:39,760
inductive virtue and blah blah and it

5572
03:06:37,920 --> 03:06:41,120
revolves on this thing called an ether

5573
03:06:39,760 --> 03:06:43,520
and by the way there are these little

5574
03:06:41,120 --> 03:06:44,880
vortices and gears and the gears have

5575
03:06:43,520 --> 03:06:46,319
these planetary things and they suck up

5576
03:06:44,879 --> 03:06:47,759
vortices and the vortices to determine

5577
03:06:46,318 --> 03:06:48,719
the density of the electromagnetic

5578
03:06:47,760 --> 03:06:50,318
potent

5579
03:06:48,719 --> 03:06:52,559
you'd be like this guy's a freaking not

5580
03:06:50,318 --> 03:06:54,079
a and and what would you do come

5581
03:06:52,559 --> 03:06:55,920
on honestly you would say everything

5582
03:06:54,079 --> 03:06:58,000
this guy does is wrong i mean he's got

5583
03:06:55,920 --> 03:07:00,559
this idiotic idea and it would be proven

5584
03:06:58,000 --> 03:07:03,359
falsified a couple decades later by uh

5585
03:07:00,559 --> 03:07:05,039
michaelson and morley and in so doing

5586
03:07:03,359 --> 03:07:07,680
you would have thrown out a very

5587
03:07:05,040 --> 03:07:09,600
beautiful baby with bathwater or imagine

5588
03:07:07,680 --> 03:07:12,960
twitter imagine a twit storm you know

5589
03:07:09,600 --> 03:07:15,200
clerk maxwell uh at clerk maxwell uh one

5590
03:07:12,959 --> 03:07:16,799
would get it would be brutal right and

5591
03:07:15,200 --> 03:07:18,720
to the detriment and that might even set

5592
03:07:16,799 --> 03:07:20,719
back history imagine yang mills doing

5593
03:07:18,719 --> 03:07:22,799
the same thing churn simon's all these

5594
03:07:20,719 --> 03:07:25,039
things are very fantastic but but why

5595
03:07:22,799 --> 03:07:27,278
lex why does ed witten

5596
03:07:25,040 --> 03:07:29,279
what is juan aldo cena let me give a

5597
03:07:27,279 --> 03:07:30,640
good example one guest brilliant guy i

5598
03:07:29,279 --> 03:07:32,880
love him

5599
03:07:30,639 --> 03:07:34,398
he is the reason that stephen hawking

5600
03:07:32,879 --> 03:07:36,639
conceded his black hole information

5601
03:07:34,398 --> 03:07:38,799
paradox loss uh issue what did he

5602
03:07:36,639 --> 03:07:42,239
conceive it conceded based upon mile the

5603
03:07:38,799 --> 03:07:44,879
same as calculation in ads cft and

5604
03:07:42,239 --> 03:07:46,159
five-dimensional wormholes about

5605
03:07:44,879 --> 03:07:47,839
is any of that first of all we don't

5606
03:07:46,159 --> 03:07:49,840
live in an ads universe second of all we

5607
03:07:47,840 --> 03:07:52,079
don't know if wormholes are traversable

5608
03:07:49,840 --> 03:07:53,520
if they exist even uh you know these are

5609
03:07:52,079 --> 03:07:55,840
devices you know kip thorn is

5610
03:07:53,520 --> 03:07:57,520
popularized from movies like to say that

5611
03:07:55,840 --> 03:07:59,359
this is something on which i will

5612
03:07:57,520 --> 03:08:01,040
concede a bat now obviously hawking was

5613
03:07:59,359 --> 03:08:03,520
doing that for publicity why does

5614
03:08:01,040 --> 03:08:06,399
maldisana what is and he's got a pretty

5615
03:08:03,520 --> 03:08:08,239
high h index pretty well respect guy ias

5616
03:08:06,398 --> 03:08:11,199
loved talking to him brilliant guy by

5617
03:08:08,239 --> 03:08:12,879
the way he also had uh made use of eric

5618
03:08:11,200 --> 03:08:15,359
and pia's work on gauge theory and

5619
03:08:12,879 --> 03:08:16,639
economics uh originally and one i

5620
03:08:15,359 --> 03:08:18,720
believe the breakthrough i can't

5621
03:08:16,639 --> 03:08:20,478
remember exactly what but partially you

5622
03:08:18,719 --> 03:08:22,719
know credit some of the work that he did

5623
03:08:20,478 --> 03:08:24,879
which appears there's a footnote to pia

5624
03:08:22,719 --> 03:08:27,199
milani's thesis and some conversations

5625
03:08:24,879 --> 03:08:29,438
with eric i think in it anyway getting

5626
03:08:27,200 --> 03:08:31,920
back to that why why is there not the

5627
03:08:29,439 --> 03:08:34,559
same skepticism is it because maldisana

5628
03:08:31,920 --> 03:08:36,478
who's an eminent physicist obviously has

5629
03:08:34,559 --> 03:08:38,478
published you know realistic work and

5630
03:08:36,478 --> 03:08:40,639
done and what about whitten

5631
03:08:38,478 --> 03:08:42,318
you know whitten gets a pass i mean if

5632
03:08:40,639 --> 03:08:44,719
you wouldn't get so passed on which

5633
03:08:42,318 --> 03:08:46,159
aspect the strength yeah the m theory is

5634
03:08:44,719 --> 03:08:48,239
correct i mean here's let me just say

5635
03:08:46,159 --> 03:08:50,719
hawking hawking gets the ultimate pass

5636
03:08:48,239 --> 03:08:52,239
hawking would say things like m theory

5637
03:08:50,719 --> 03:08:53,840
there's zero evidence for it i mean

5638
03:08:52,239 --> 03:08:55,520
there's the famous meme that went around

5639
03:08:53,840 --> 03:08:56,880
this weekend like what is string theory

5640
03:08:55,520 --> 03:08:58,159
predicted and it's nothing and by the

5641
03:08:56,879 --> 03:08:59,599
way that's actually wrong i talked to

5642
03:08:58,159 --> 03:09:01,279
cameron i know you talked to carmen

5643
03:08:59,600 --> 03:09:03,040
carmen says that string theory does make

5644
03:09:01,279 --> 03:09:05,279
predictions it predicts the mass of the

5645
03:09:03,040 --> 03:09:06,800
electron lies between 10 to the minus 1

5646
03:09:05,279 --> 03:09:09,600
planck mass and 10 to the minus 30

5647
03:09:06,799 --> 03:09:11,519
plagma okay whatever our electron it's a

5648
03:09:09,600 --> 03:09:13,520
big range it's a huge range

5649
03:09:11,520 --> 03:09:15,840
is that imagine qumran comes up and

5650
03:09:13,520 --> 03:09:16,720
again he's just some nobody but he

5651
03:09:15,840 --> 03:09:19,040
actually you know he doesn't have a

5652
03:09:16,719 --> 03:09:21,119
profile he's not harvard has zero h

5653
03:09:19,040 --> 03:09:23,040
index or whatever eric says

5654
03:09:21,120 --> 03:09:24,800
why do we not like in other words why

5655
03:09:23,040 --> 03:09:26,800
are we more harsh on people that are

5656
03:09:24,799 --> 03:09:29,920
that are trying you know the answer to

5657
03:09:26,799 --> 03:09:33,358
that so i get a million emails just like

5658
03:09:29,920 --> 03:09:35,279
you said you yourself where they proven

5659
03:09:33,359 --> 03:09:36,000
in my world is artificial intelligence

5660
03:09:35,279 --> 03:09:37,359
the

5661
03:09:36,000 --> 03:09:39,600
equivalence of that

5662
03:09:37,359 --> 03:09:41,680
uh is i figured out how to build

5663
03:09:39,600 --> 03:09:44,399
consciousness how to engineer

5664
03:09:41,680 --> 03:09:45,920
intelligence how to in and awesome you

5665
03:09:44,398 --> 03:09:47,840
should send your emails to me and i'll

5666
03:09:45,920 --> 03:09:49,680
send my emails and we'll reply

5667
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:51,760
i mean i and i don't want to sort of

5668
03:09:49,680 --> 03:09:53,359
mock this because i think it's very

5669
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:55,840
possible that there is

5670
03:09:53,359 --> 03:09:58,479
either kernels of interesting ideas or

5671
03:09:55,840 --> 03:10:00,559
and whole like there is geniuses out

5672
03:09:58,478 --> 03:10:02,959
there that are unheard but the because

5673
03:10:00,559 --> 03:10:05,039
of so much noise

5674
03:10:02,959 --> 03:10:06,159
you do have to

5675
03:10:05,040 --> 03:10:07,600
weigh

5676
03:10:06,159 --> 03:10:10,799
like uh

5677
03:10:07,600 --> 03:10:13,760
hire the edwins of the world when they

5678
03:10:10,799 --> 03:10:15,519
make statements and that's why you build

5679
03:10:13,760 --> 03:10:16,800
up a track record as you just said with

5680
03:10:15,520 --> 03:10:18,800
ray dalio

5681
03:10:16,799 --> 03:10:21,278
you have to show

5682
03:10:18,799 --> 03:10:23,759
that you can uh

5683
03:10:21,279 --> 03:10:26,800
like if you're pollock and you show us a

5684
03:10:23,760 --> 03:10:28,398
painting of a bunch of chaos you have to

5685
03:10:26,799 --> 03:10:29,599
and this is a bad example probably

5686
03:10:28,398 --> 03:10:32,478
because he probably never showed this

5687
03:10:29,600 --> 03:10:34,640
book he could do it right yeah

5688
03:10:32,478 --> 03:10:36,000
it's much more conf it's much more

5689
03:10:34,639 --> 03:10:38,639
comforting

5690
03:10:36,000 --> 03:10:40,959
to see that they can paint a good

5691
03:10:38,639 --> 03:10:44,000
accurate picture still life of still

5692
03:10:40,959 --> 03:10:45,759
life of an apple on the table so there's

5693
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:47,439
a meteorite at a time because then i

5694
03:10:45,760 --> 03:10:49,200
mean um

5695
03:10:47,439 --> 03:10:50,720
uh because then

5696
03:10:49,200 --> 03:10:52,640
there's something about the scientific

5697
03:10:50,719 --> 03:10:54,959
community that they have perhaps an

5698
03:10:52,639 --> 03:10:56,639
oversensitive sensor to where

5699
03:10:54,959 --> 03:10:58,639
they're not going to give the full

5700
03:10:56,639 --> 03:11:00,398
effort of their attention

5701
03:10:58,639 --> 03:11:02,398
if you don't have the track record now

5702
03:11:00,398 --> 03:11:04,398
you could say that's the kind of club

5703
03:11:02,398 --> 03:11:06,879
that only you have to like you have to

5704
03:11:04,398 --> 03:11:07,680
have 10 you have to this yes that exists

5705
03:11:06,879 --> 03:11:09,199
but

5706
03:11:07,680 --> 03:11:11,439
there's some aspect in which you have to

5707
03:11:09,200 --> 03:11:13,680
play the game a little bit

5708
03:11:11,439 --> 03:11:15,200
to get the machine of science going

5709
03:11:13,680 --> 03:11:17,600
otherwise if you're

5710
03:11:15,200 --> 03:11:19,200
uh always saying well i'm

5711
03:11:17,600 --> 03:11:21,920
i have my ball and i don't want to play

5712
03:11:19,200 --> 03:11:23,600
your game your game sucks then nobody's

5713
03:11:21,920 --> 03:11:26,159
going to want to play with you that's

5714
03:11:23,600 --> 03:11:28,479
true in there look inherent in all this

5715
03:11:26,159 --> 03:11:30,159
is an underlying grandiosity look how

5716
03:11:28,478 --> 03:11:32,318
could you talk about

5717
03:11:30,159 --> 03:11:34,079
doing what cox said on on here and

5718
03:11:32,318 --> 03:11:35,439
elsewhere you know we're looking for the

5719
03:11:34,079 --> 03:11:37,039
umbilical cord that connects our

5720
03:11:35,439 --> 03:11:38,800
universe to another universe that will

5721
03:11:37,040 --> 03:11:40,640
then reveal in a one-inch equation that

5722
03:11:38,799 --> 03:11:42,639
will surely win a nobel prize the mind

5723
03:11:40,639 --> 03:11:44,398
of god that's like a prerequisite i

5724
03:11:42,639 --> 03:11:46,000
guess to tackle these questions i think

5725
03:11:44,398 --> 03:11:48,639
it's it's

5726
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:50,000
detrimental i think doing that first of

5727
03:11:48,639 --> 03:11:51,199
all i think there's an element of almost

5728
03:11:50,000 --> 03:11:53,359
snarkiness because none of these

5729
03:11:51,200 --> 03:11:55,359
scientists are believing you know uh

5730
03:11:53,359 --> 03:11:56,720
gnostics they're they're not theists

5731
03:11:55,359 --> 03:11:58,238
right so they're using it as kind of a

5732
03:11:56,719 --> 03:11:59,438
stand-in and they always talk about

5733
03:11:58,238 --> 03:12:01,279
einstein didn't mean it was like a

5734
03:11:59,439 --> 03:12:03,120
spinoza and he wasn't a you know a

5735
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:04,880
theater god doesn't play dice god

5736
03:12:03,120 --> 03:12:07,040
doesn't play yeah he's mentions of god

5737
03:12:04,879 --> 03:12:09,119
yeah yeah and then um stephen hawking

5738
03:12:07,040 --> 03:12:11,439
says if when we come we get m theory

5739
03:12:09,120 --> 03:12:14,079
understood we'll know the mind of god uh

5740
03:12:11,439 --> 03:12:16,479
that's the title of kaku's book the god

5741
03:12:14,079 --> 03:12:17,600
particle the god equation

5742
03:12:16,478 --> 03:12:19,358
it you know

5743
03:12:17,600 --> 03:12:20,880
do any of them really believe in that no

5744
03:12:19,359 --> 03:12:23,359
is that a prerequisite no i'm not saying

5745
03:12:20,879 --> 03:12:24,398
that but um but the point being you're

5746
03:12:23,359 --> 03:12:26,079
talking about something has to do with

5747
03:12:24,398 --> 03:12:28,000
god right i mean where else do you go

5748
03:12:26,079 --> 03:12:29,840
from there i mean i think god for now

5749
03:12:28,000 --> 03:12:33,040
enjoys a little bit more you know kind

5750
03:12:29,840 --> 03:12:35,439
of pr than elon or joe or whatever right

5751
03:12:33,040 --> 03:12:37,359
so so like it's you know god's got a

5752
03:12:35,439 --> 03:12:39,200
pretty good you know h index himself he

5753
03:12:37,359 --> 03:12:40,720
has a by the way a twitter account just

5754
03:12:39,200 --> 03:12:42,880
so you know it's pretty good it tweets

5755
03:12:40,719 --> 03:12:45,519
of god yeah

5756
03:12:42,879 --> 03:12:46,799
um so if you look at that um you have to

5757
03:12:45,520 --> 03:12:48,640
go in there again you have to go with

5758
03:12:46,799 --> 03:12:51,039
some swagger you have to have a little

5759
03:12:48,639 --> 03:12:52,719
bit of of arrogance but you should i

5760
03:12:51,040 --> 03:12:54,560
agree mix with a little bit of humility

5761
03:12:52,719 --> 03:12:56,559
so he's doing something he comes from

5762
03:12:54,559 --> 03:12:58,238
outside of academia now if he rails

5763
03:12:56,559 --> 03:12:59,680
against er i'm talking about eric if

5764
03:12:58,238 --> 03:13:01,119
he's just railing oh the system and i'm

5765
03:12:59,680 --> 03:13:02,559
not going to publish because f that and

5766
03:13:01,120 --> 03:13:04,399
that's only created by by greedy

5767
03:13:02,559 --> 03:13:06,159
journals i i don't think he's doing

5768
03:13:04,398 --> 03:13:08,159
himself any favors on the other hand if

5769
03:13:06,159 --> 03:13:11,680
he's shopping it if he's talking it if

5770
03:13:08,159 --> 03:13:14,478
he's if he's willing to expose it to uh

5771
03:13:11,680 --> 03:13:16,720
to to criticism and to even embrace

5772
03:13:14,478 --> 03:13:19,199
people who may not have the purest

5773
03:13:16,719 --> 03:13:20,959
intentions perhaps but in the sense of

5774
03:13:19,200 --> 03:13:22,560
of like they're they're not arguing

5775
03:13:20,959 --> 03:13:24,559
solely to get to the truth with a

5776
03:13:22,559 --> 03:13:26,398
capital t what they're trying to do is

5777
03:13:24,559 --> 03:13:28,000
take down error hopefully those aren't

5778
03:13:26,398 --> 03:13:29,278
those people aren't out there but on the

5779
03:13:28,000 --> 03:13:31,520
other hand

5780
03:13:29,279 --> 03:13:33,840
looking at what eric does for other

5781
03:13:31,520 --> 03:13:35,920
people looking at the fact that he has

5782
03:13:33,840 --> 03:13:37,600
courtesy he will look at wolfram he will

5783
03:13:35,920 --> 03:13:39,680
look at lisey who's one of his closest

5784
03:13:37,600 --> 03:13:41,840
friends i mean he calls him his uh as is

5785
03:13:39,680 --> 03:13:43,120
not his nemesis nemesis right right yeah

5786
03:13:41,840 --> 03:13:44,880
and i think that's interesting that

5787
03:13:43,120 --> 03:13:46,319
they're loving friends i really enjoyed

5788
03:13:44,879 --> 03:13:48,879
that portal conversation between

5789
03:13:46,318 --> 03:13:51,680
guerrillas uh eric eric has torn about

5790
03:13:48,879 --> 03:13:53,920
that conversation because i guess

5791
03:13:51,680 --> 03:13:55,920
because of the nemesis of the beautiful

5792
03:13:53,920 --> 03:13:57,120
dance of minds playing with these ideas

5793
03:13:55,920 --> 03:13:58,960
and fears of everything some of these

5794
03:13:57,120 --> 03:14:01,200
things you know look so fundamentally

5795
03:13:58,959 --> 03:14:02,639
now i might disagree with him eric on a

5796
03:14:01,200 --> 03:14:04,319
different aspect which is the only one

5797
03:14:02,639 --> 03:14:06,159
i'm capable of but let me say one thing

5798
03:14:04,318 --> 03:14:08,238
which is experimental but but let me say

5799
03:14:06,159 --> 03:14:09,760
one thing i understand probably

5800
03:14:08,238 --> 03:14:12,398
a third of what eric's talking about

5801
03:14:09,760 --> 03:14:14,398
with gu i understand you know gr i

5802
03:14:12,398 --> 03:14:16,799
understand mathematics i understand some

5803
03:14:14,398 --> 03:14:19,039
group theory fiber bond i can get a

5804
03:14:16,799 --> 03:14:20,879
little of the age theory um

5805
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:22,720
but i i also understand what i don't

5806
03:14:20,879 --> 03:14:25,679
understand and i understand that there

5807
03:14:22,719 --> 03:14:27,519
are people like witten maldisana uh nema

5808
03:14:25,680 --> 03:14:29,760
other people that that can't understand

5809
03:14:27,520 --> 03:14:31,520
it and they're not trying to understand

5810
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:33,200
sabine she can understand she makes all

5811
03:14:31,520 --> 03:14:34,238
these you know oh i don't understand it

5812
03:14:33,200 --> 03:14:36,399
i don't want to understand it i don't

5813
03:14:34,238 --> 03:14:38,559
have time and then she makes a video a

5814
03:14:36,398 --> 03:14:40,238
music video you know kind of mocking

5815
03:14:38,559 --> 03:14:41,760
eric and stephen and garrett yeah i'm

5816
03:14:40,238 --> 03:14:43,439
like oh you have a time to do and i love

5817
03:14:41,760 --> 03:14:45,680
sabine and i've i've actually promoted

5818
03:14:43,439 --> 03:14:48,159
my show on her and i i love her and

5819
03:14:45,680 --> 03:14:49,680
she's doing a wonderful job but

5820
03:14:48,159 --> 03:14:51,039
you have a video that you said yourself

5821
03:14:49,680 --> 03:14:52,800
takes eight weeks to produce from start

5822
03:14:51,040 --> 03:14:55,040
to finish and you couldn't have spent

5823
03:14:52,799 --> 03:14:56,639
you know 30 minutes two hours i brian

5824
03:14:55,040 --> 03:14:58,880
keating have done it as an experimental

5825
03:14:56,639 --> 03:15:00,478
cosmologist and i have enough to say

5826
03:14:58,879 --> 03:15:02,799
like this is interesting it's part of

5827
03:15:00,478 --> 03:15:03,840
the assayer project and it actually i

5828
03:15:02,799 --> 03:15:05,119
shouldn't say that there are no people

5829
03:15:03,840 --> 03:15:08,079
they're very serious

5830
03:15:05,120 --> 03:15:10,079
uh alvarez gomez at suny stony brook

5831
03:15:08,079 --> 03:15:11,680
simon center for geometrical physics so

5832
03:15:10,079 --> 03:15:12,879
he and i are running this this uh

5833
03:15:11,680 --> 03:15:14,720
seminar hopefully this summer we're

5834
03:15:12,879 --> 03:15:17,358
going to reenact the famous shelter

5835
03:15:14,719 --> 03:15:19,119
island conferences in the 1900s

5836
03:15:17,359 --> 03:15:20,960
where you know feynman got together and

5837
03:15:19,120 --> 03:15:23,120
they calculated the lamb shift

5838
03:15:20,959 --> 03:15:25,919
but what did that feature

5839
03:15:23,120 --> 03:15:28,399
the harmony the resonant minds behind

5840
03:15:25,920 --> 03:15:30,079
the best experimentalist in cosmology

5841
03:15:28,398 --> 03:15:31,599
particle physics condensed matter

5842
03:15:30,079 --> 03:15:33,439
physics is now teaching us tremendous

5843
03:15:31,600 --> 03:15:36,079
things about you know lower dimensional

5844
03:15:33,439 --> 03:15:37,680
systems that can be applied um theorists

5845
03:15:36,079 --> 03:15:40,478
and experimentalists observers

5846
03:15:37,680 --> 03:15:42,079
cosmologists we all were get together

5847
03:15:40,478 --> 03:15:44,478
and we're just gonna do it out of a

5848
03:15:42,079 --> 03:15:46,318
spirit of love but if it's just like oh

5849
03:15:44,478 --> 03:15:47,840
this guy's like a loud map i don't have

5850
03:15:46,318 --> 03:15:49,199
time for that i really don't i don't i

5851
03:15:47,840 --> 03:15:52,000
don't think it's interesting way to

5852
03:15:49,200 --> 03:15:53,600
spend my time there is a aspect that i

5853
03:15:52,000 --> 03:15:55,359
hope to see and

5854
03:15:53,600 --> 03:15:57,920
it goes back to our sort of uh

5855
03:15:55,359 --> 03:15:59,840
discussion with about joe rogan

5856
03:15:57,920 --> 03:16:01,680
i do hope to see sort of love and

5857
03:15:59,840 --> 03:16:03,760
humility in the presentation like let go

5858
03:16:01,680 --> 03:16:06,318
of this kind of

5859
03:16:03,760 --> 03:16:08,800
fear of your ideas being stolen and the

5860
03:16:06,318 --> 03:16:12,000
ego that's inherent to the scientific

5861
03:16:08,799 --> 03:16:14,079
pursuit and um right

5862
03:16:12,000 --> 03:16:16,478
now that everybody's

5863
03:16:14,079 --> 03:16:18,238
established and known entities let go of

5864
03:16:16,478 --> 03:16:20,398
that a little bit so we can

5865
03:16:18,238 --> 03:16:21,920
explore and celebrate ideas i would love

5866
03:16:20,398 --> 03:16:24,238
to see more of that just because you're

5867
03:16:21,920 --> 03:16:26,398
saying especially with these big ideas

5868
03:16:24,238 --> 03:16:28,238
of theories of everything

5869
03:16:26,398 --> 03:16:29,920
i mean this isn't talking tales out of

5870
03:16:28,238 --> 03:16:31,760
school but i mean he has made claims

5871
03:16:29,920 --> 03:16:33,120
that i fundamentally disagree with you

5872
03:16:31,760 --> 03:16:34,960
know in terms of like

5873
03:16:33,120 --> 03:16:37,040
you know he's had this twitter

5874
03:16:34,959 --> 03:16:37,919
baiting you know loving trolling of elon

5875
03:16:37,040 --> 03:16:39,359
you know why are you spending all this

5876
03:16:37,920 --> 03:16:40,559
money to get to mars you know we should

5877
03:16:39,359 --> 03:16:42,800
be spending money on interdimensional

5878
03:16:40,559 --> 03:16:44,398
travel and we can unlock it if we and i

5879
03:16:42,799 --> 03:16:47,199
said to him like and he makes the point

5880
03:16:44,398 --> 03:16:49,439
you know that oh the atomic theory

5881
03:16:47,200 --> 03:16:51,359
you know that unleashed the nuclear age

5882
03:16:49,439 --> 03:16:52,960
and uh and that you know could lead to

5883
03:16:51,359 --> 03:16:54,960
planetary destruction

5884
03:16:52,959 --> 03:16:57,119
um but i make the point pushing back

5885
03:16:54,959 --> 03:16:58,799
with love on him and i say look nobody

5886
03:16:57,120 --> 03:17:00,560
looked into the equations you know like

5887
03:16:58,799 --> 03:17:02,478
fermi didn't like look into all these

5888
03:17:00,559 --> 03:17:04,318
equations of of the unification which

5889
03:17:02,478 --> 03:17:05,920
still doesn't exist by the way we spend

5890
03:17:04,318 --> 03:17:07,278
all this time lex and i don't know why

5891
03:17:05,920 --> 03:17:09,279
it is it's a phenomenon purely in

5892
03:17:07,279 --> 03:17:10,800
theoretical physics people are looking

5893
03:17:09,279 --> 03:17:12,960
for the toe

5894
03:17:10,799 --> 03:17:14,000
and they're overlooking the gut in other

5895
03:17:12,959 --> 03:17:15,919
words they're spending all this time in

5896
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:17,600
the theory of everything that god equate

5897
03:17:15,920 --> 03:17:19,200
and there's this gut that unifies the

5898
03:17:17,600 --> 03:17:20,720
three stronger forces we don't have a

5899
03:17:19,200 --> 03:17:22,880
single theory for that and people like

5900
03:17:20,719 --> 03:17:24,840
lashound they've tried and failed at it

5901
03:17:22,879 --> 03:17:27,119
yeah people don't know there's four

5902
03:17:24,840 --> 03:17:29,439
forces gut grant unification theories

5903
03:17:27,120 --> 03:17:31,120
that unifies the three forces stuff and

5904
03:17:29,439 --> 03:17:32,800
done trying to get a shortcut to the

5905
03:17:31,120 --> 03:17:33,760
theory of everything which unifies the

5906
03:17:32,799 --> 03:17:35,679
four

5907
03:17:33,760 --> 03:17:37,279
um and then there's this whole thing

5908
03:17:35,680 --> 03:17:39,840
that may be quantum gravity is not even

5909
03:17:37,279 --> 03:17:40,720
a thing right

5910
03:17:39,840 --> 03:17:43,120
um

5911
03:17:40,719 --> 03:17:44,478
so we're we're we're trying to solve

5912
03:17:43,120 --> 03:17:46,399
uh

5913
03:17:44,478 --> 03:17:48,879
we're trying to solve the puzzle of

5914
03:17:46,398 --> 03:17:51,439
everything at the physics level

5915
03:17:48,879 --> 03:17:53,599
and then already before solving it

5916
03:17:51,439 --> 03:17:55,439
already saying once we solve it here's

5917
03:17:53,600 --> 03:17:56,960
going to be all the beautiful just like

5918
03:17:55,439 --> 03:18:00,479
time levels jumping in yeah going to

5919
03:17:56,959 --> 03:18:00,478
level you know 256.

5920
03:18:00,799 --> 03:18:06,719
yeah yeah yeah i mean i i suppose you

5921
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:08,880
need that kind of ego that confidence

5922
03:18:06,719 --> 03:18:10,238
that ambition in order to even have a

5923
03:18:08,879 --> 03:18:12,159
chance at some of these the only two

5924
03:18:10,238 --> 03:18:14,799
people in this book of nine nobel

5925
03:18:12,159 --> 03:18:16,318
laureates who told me they don't

5926
03:18:14,799 --> 03:18:17,920
have the imposter syndrome were two

5927
03:18:16,318 --> 03:18:19,278
theorists frank wilchuck and sheldon

5928
03:18:17,920 --> 03:18:20,960
glashow

5929
03:18:19,279 --> 03:18:22,079
and you know frank is pretty interesting

5930
03:18:20,959 --> 03:18:23,679
and i know eventually we're gonna talk

5931
03:18:22,079 --> 03:18:25,120
about the meaning of life but you talk

5932
03:18:23,680 --> 03:18:26,880
about frank

5933
03:18:25,120 --> 03:18:29,920
frank invented this theory along with

5934
03:18:26,879 --> 03:18:33,519
his advisor and another a third person

5935
03:18:29,920 --> 03:18:34,719
in the early 1970s which from 1974

5936
03:18:33,520 --> 03:18:36,720
through when he was at princeton all the

5937
03:18:34,719 --> 03:18:38,959
way up until 2004 when he won the nobel

5938
03:18:36,719 --> 03:18:40,398
prize every day of his life imagine this

5939
03:18:38,959 --> 03:18:41,599
alex you're going to have this startup

5940
03:18:40,398 --> 03:18:43,358
someone tells actually someone tells you

5941
03:18:41,600 --> 03:18:45,040
you're going to win the lottery you're a

5942
03:18:43,359 --> 03:18:47,279
lottery in 40 years

5943
03:18:45,040 --> 03:18:51,840
what becomes your singular focus in your

5944
03:18:47,279 --> 03:18:51,840
life from now until the next 40 years

5945
03:18:52,318 --> 03:18:55,600
well

5946
03:18:53,200 --> 03:18:57,279
i'm not sure i mean would it be winning

5947
03:18:55,600 --> 03:18:58,960
the lottery or if i'm sorry i'm sorry if

5948
03:18:57,279 --> 03:19:00,479
you're guaranteed to win a lottery yeah

5949
03:18:58,959 --> 03:19:01,599
there's this here's this wallet bitcoin

5950
03:19:00,478 --> 03:19:03,920
wallet it's going to guarantee i have

5951
03:19:01,600 --> 03:19:05,279
this much money stablecoin whatever uh

5952
03:19:03,920 --> 03:19:07,200
you're going to win it 40 but you have

5953
03:19:05,279 --> 03:19:09,120
to wait 40 years to me it would be

5954
03:19:07,200 --> 03:19:10,640
surviving for the next 40 years you

5955
03:19:09,120 --> 03:19:12,479
wouldn't leave your house you would

5956
03:19:10,639 --> 03:19:14,159
cover go out in a bubble wrap hat you

5957
03:19:12,478 --> 03:19:16,719
wouldn't go out without 20 masks on

5958
03:19:14,159 --> 03:19:18,238
right your whole life would be consumed

5959
03:19:16,719 --> 03:19:19,278
with now imagine everyone's telling you

5960
03:19:18,238 --> 03:19:20,879
you're going to win the nobel prize

5961
03:19:19,279 --> 03:19:22,399
which is bigger than the lottery i mean

5962
03:19:20,879 --> 03:19:24,719
many peop prizes are worth more than the

5963
03:19:22,398 --> 03:19:26,398
nobel prize and every person who wins a

5964
03:19:24,719 --> 03:19:27,920
prize that's worth three times the money

5965
03:19:26,398 --> 03:19:29,920
like maldasena he would trade the

5966
03:19:27,920 --> 03:19:31,439
breakthrough prize for a nobel prize in

5967
03:19:29,920 --> 03:19:34,079
a heartbeat so

5968
03:19:31,439 --> 03:19:35,920
these guys had to wait 40 years imagine

5969
03:19:34,079 --> 03:19:37,760
the excruciating pain what got him

5970
03:19:35,920 --> 03:19:39,840
through it he didn't feel like he didn't

5971
03:19:37,760 --> 03:19:42,719
deserve it he felt like hell yeah i

5972
03:19:39,840 --> 03:19:44,639
earned it he has that swagger and what

5973
03:19:42,719 --> 03:19:47,119
i'm looking for in this asshair is to

5974
03:19:44,639 --> 03:19:48,478
try to find ways that we can test stuff

5975
03:19:47,120 --> 03:19:50,399
now because i don't know if i'm going to

5976
03:19:48,478 --> 03:19:51,840
be here in 40 years i hope i am but can

5977
03:19:50,398 --> 03:19:54,000
we bypass can we get shortcuts what's

5978
03:19:51,840 --> 03:19:55,760
called the low energy regime and to me

5979
03:19:54,000 --> 03:19:57,279
that's that's what's interesting like

5980
03:19:55,760 --> 03:19:59,439
what can we do now i don't care like

5981
03:19:57,279 --> 03:20:00,479
isaac newton came up with color theory

5982
03:19:59,439 --> 03:20:01,680
and he did something really interesting

5983
03:20:00,478 --> 03:20:03,599
next time i come i'll bring you some

5984
03:20:01,680 --> 03:20:05,600
prisms so what did he do he took a white

5985
03:20:03,600 --> 03:20:06,880
light he took a prism from the sun

5986
03:20:05,600 --> 03:20:08,880
actually he put it through a slit put it

5987
03:20:06,879 --> 03:20:10,478
through a prism and it made a beautiful

5988
03:20:08,879 --> 03:20:12,478
rainbow like you've seen

5989
03:20:10,478 --> 03:20:14,559
and then he took another prism and he

5990
03:20:12,478 --> 03:20:16,159
put it upside down like you know dark

5991
03:20:14,559 --> 03:20:17,439
side of the moon whatever and the light

5992
03:20:16,159 --> 03:20:19,439
went through the first prism turned into

5993
03:20:17,439 --> 03:20:21,359
a rainbow and then the rainbow went into

5994
03:20:19,439 --> 03:20:23,359
a prism and came out a white light

5995
03:20:21,359 --> 03:20:25,359
that's pretty cool then he took a

5996
03:20:23,359 --> 03:20:27,520
popsicle stick or whatever his

5997
03:20:25,359 --> 03:20:29,760
pipe tobacco and and he put it in the

5998
03:20:27,520 --> 03:20:31,840
beam like blocked out the orange and it

5999
03:20:29,760 --> 03:20:34,159
didn't make white light come out so he

6000
03:20:31,840 --> 03:20:36,159
showed like colors of synthesis it's a

6001
03:20:34,159 --> 03:20:38,079
combination he didn't use like uh the

6002
03:20:36,159 --> 03:20:39,600
large hadron collider to do that you

6003
03:20:38,079 --> 03:20:41,439
know he used a very low energy

6004
03:20:39,600 --> 03:20:43,040
experiment to prove a unification in

6005
03:20:41,439 --> 03:20:44,159
this color physics and different kind of

6006
03:20:43,040 --> 03:20:46,479
color physics than quantum

6007
03:20:44,159 --> 03:20:48,398
chromodynamics but nevertheless can we

6008
03:20:46,478 --> 03:20:50,079
find things like that are we spending

6009
03:20:48,398 --> 03:20:52,238
way too much time and energy thinking

6010
03:20:50,079 --> 03:20:53,920
about the future circular collider which

6011
03:20:52,238 --> 03:20:55,439
even if it gets built will cost 30

6012
03:20:53,920 --> 03:20:57,200
billion dollars just to build by the way

6013
03:20:55,439 --> 03:20:58,880
anytime from now on if i leave you with

6014
03:20:57,200 --> 03:21:00,319
anything anytime an experimental

6015
03:20:58,879 --> 03:21:02,318
physicist tells you a number always

6016
03:21:00,318 --> 03:21:04,478
double it maybe triple it how much it's

6017
03:21:02,318 --> 03:21:06,559
going to cost to operate it so like do

6018
03:21:04,478 --> 03:21:08,318
we build an aircraft carrier to build an

6019
03:21:06,559 --> 03:21:10,559
aircraft carrier do we build a nuclear

6020
03:21:08,318 --> 03:21:12,000
reactor a semiconductor facility and the

6021
03:21:10,559 --> 03:21:13,920
rule of thumb that works pretty well in

6022
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:16,478
project management is it costs about 10

6023
03:21:13,920 --> 03:21:18,639
per year to operate a given object of

6024
03:21:16,478 --> 03:21:20,398
sufficient complexity and in this case

6025
03:21:18,639 --> 03:21:22,478
so in 10 years it'll cost double the

6026
03:21:20,398 --> 03:21:23,920
cost so never believe a number whether

6027
03:21:22,478 --> 03:21:25,840
it's from our mutual friend harry or

6028
03:21:23,920 --> 03:21:28,000
whoever don't believe the number double

6029
03:21:25,840 --> 03:21:30,318
it and then say is it worth it and so

6030
03:21:28,000 --> 03:21:32,318
building a solar system size accelerator

6031
03:21:30,318 --> 03:21:34,879
even if it were possible do we have to

6032
03:21:32,318 --> 03:21:37,439
do that or can we use these two 30 solar

6033
03:21:34,879 --> 03:21:39,599
mass objects colliding together to test

6034
03:21:37,439 --> 03:21:41,279
the the number of large extra spatial

6035
03:21:39,600 --> 03:21:43,040
dimensions can we do that people are

6036
03:21:41,279 --> 03:21:43,840
working on it i think it's fascinating

6037
03:21:43,040 --> 03:21:47,279
so

6038
03:21:43,840 --> 03:21:48,318
focus on building detectors experiments

6039
03:21:47,279 --> 03:21:50,720
uh

6040
03:21:48,318 --> 03:21:50,719
that

6041
03:21:50,840 --> 03:21:56,478
like where the cosmos is part of the

6042
03:21:54,799 --> 03:21:58,478
experiment i suppose that's doing the

6043
03:21:56,478 --> 03:22:00,079
hard work because when you're saying low

6044
03:21:58,478 --> 03:22:02,000
energy regime

6045
03:22:00,079 --> 03:22:03,760
because for some of these especially big

6046
03:22:02,000 --> 03:22:07,200
questions like theories of everything

6047
03:22:03,760 --> 03:22:09,520
you need some high energy events

6048
03:22:07,200 --> 03:22:11,760
and so somehow figure out how the high

6049
03:22:09,520 --> 03:22:15,359
energy events that are already happening

6050
03:22:11,760 --> 03:22:16,960
out there how to leverage them

6051
03:22:15,359 --> 03:22:19,920
here on earth so one of the alternative

6052
03:22:16,959 --> 03:22:22,000
theories of uh cosmology that is not a

6053
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:24,559
singular quantum gravitational requiring

6054
03:22:22,000 --> 03:22:26,959
as the big bang and inflation are is uh

6055
03:22:24,559 --> 03:22:29,199
are these bouncing models some of them

6056
03:22:26,959 --> 03:22:30,559
feature a similar kind of entity called

6057
03:22:29,200 --> 03:22:32,880
the quantum field

6058
03:22:30,559 --> 03:22:34,559
and that quantum field in the initial

6059
03:22:32,879 --> 03:22:35,920
stages of the universe of our current

6060
03:22:34,559 --> 03:22:38,079
after the bounce which is not a

6061
03:22:35,920 --> 03:22:39,920
singularity it compresses to a classical

6062
03:22:38,079 --> 03:22:41,439
kind of rebound and the universe starts

6063
03:22:39,920 --> 03:22:43,279
expanding

6064
03:22:41,439 --> 03:22:44,880
during that process

6065
03:22:43,279 --> 03:22:47,120
the expansion is governed by what's

6066
03:22:44,879 --> 03:22:48,478
called a scalar field of which we only

6067
03:22:47,120 --> 03:22:50,640
know one that exists that's called the

6068
03:22:48,478 --> 03:22:52,959
higgs boson i think this is a scalar um

6069
03:22:50,639 --> 03:22:55,519
fundamental particle fundamental field

6070
03:22:52,959 --> 03:22:59,438
um that field then later does double

6071
03:22:55,520 --> 03:23:01,120
duty and it becomes dark energy

6072
03:22:59,439 --> 03:23:02,559
so it solves two problems and i'm not

6073
03:23:01,120 --> 03:23:04,720
saying it's correct we don't know yet

6074
03:23:02,559 --> 03:23:06,318
but are there observations of and so

6075
03:23:04,719 --> 03:23:08,159
dark energies manifest today it's

6076
03:23:06,318 --> 03:23:11,439
manifest in properties we see in

6077
03:23:08,159 --> 03:23:13,119
supernova explosions um etc etc we see

6078
03:23:11,439 --> 03:23:15,600
the effects of accelerating universe

6079
03:23:13,120 --> 03:23:18,560
caused by presumably dark energy is dark

6080
03:23:15,600 --> 03:23:20,318
energy a constant or does it vary that

6081
03:23:18,559 --> 03:23:21,519
has to vary in order for this theory to

6082
03:23:20,318 --> 03:23:23,920
be true because that eventually has to

6083
03:23:21,520 --> 03:23:25,600
decay so the universe can not support

6084
03:23:23,920 --> 03:23:27,920
itself and collapse again again

6085
03:23:25,600 --> 03:23:29,120
classically so we could use low energy

6086
03:23:27,920 --> 03:23:31,279
phenomena it's hard to think of

6087
03:23:29,120 --> 03:23:32,880
supernovas being a low energy phenomenon

6088
03:23:31,279 --> 03:23:35,120
but you use that as a tracer of the

6089
03:23:32,879 --> 03:23:36,799
cosmic expansion field and see does it

6090
03:23:35,120 --> 03:23:38,479
change or is it a constant that's an

6091
03:23:36,799 --> 03:23:40,639
example of a low energy limit to prove a

6092
03:23:38,478 --> 03:23:42,879
high energy phenomenon like this

6093
03:23:40,639 --> 03:23:45,039
collapsing universe in the cyclic model

6094
03:23:42,879 --> 03:23:48,079
speaking of things that cost a lot but

6095
03:23:45,040 --> 03:23:48,080
are super exciting

6096
03:23:48,639 --> 03:23:52,799
uh page two

6097
03:23:50,398 --> 03:23:54,719
crap no we'll get we'll wrap it up and

6098
03:23:52,799 --> 03:23:56,318
now calm down this is this there's more

6099
03:23:54,719 --> 03:23:58,398
than page two

6100
03:23:56,318 --> 03:24:00,719
what do you think this is

6101
03:23:58,398 --> 03:24:02,398
this is uh jesus

6102
03:24:00,719 --> 03:24:03,920
well louis de broglie's thesis was three

6103
03:24:02,398 --> 03:24:06,000
pages long and he won the nobel prize

6104
03:24:03,920 --> 03:24:08,478
for the wave particle duality

6105
03:24:06,000 --> 03:24:10,559
so you know size

6106
03:24:08,478 --> 03:24:12,799
matters in different dimensions in life

6107
03:24:10,559 --> 03:24:15,278
i think the the lessons i've learned

6108
03:24:12,799 --> 03:24:17,438
about life is the shorter the paper or

6109
03:24:15,279 --> 03:24:18,960
the shorter the thesis

6110
03:24:17,439 --> 03:24:20,800
uh actually the shorter the paper some

6111
03:24:18,959 --> 03:24:23,599
of the greatest papers ever written are

6112
03:24:20,799 --> 03:24:26,079
sure like i feel like uh

6113
03:24:23,600 --> 03:24:28,318
some of the best ideas in this world not

6114
03:24:26,079 --> 03:24:29,760
to sound like a contradiction of feynman

6115
03:24:28,318 --> 03:24:31,199
a contradiction on top of a

6116
03:24:29,760 --> 03:24:33,120
contradiction but it could be written on

6117
03:24:31,200 --> 03:24:35,600
a napkin honestly

6118
03:24:33,120 --> 03:24:38,720
um it which just kind of tells you

6119
03:24:35,600 --> 03:24:38,720
something about ideas

6120
03:24:39,439 --> 03:24:44,000
what are your

6121
03:24:40,478 --> 03:24:46,398
thoughts about uh the james webb space

6122
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:48,719
telescope um is this

6123
03:24:46,398 --> 03:24:51,519
as somebody who likes

6124
03:24:48,719 --> 03:24:53,679
telescopes and this is one of the

6125
03:24:51,520 --> 03:24:56,479
i think it says um

6126
03:24:53,680 --> 03:24:57,520
it took 20 years to build 9.7 billion

6127
03:24:56,478 --> 03:24:59,438
dollars

6128
03:24:57,520 --> 03:25:01,200
is that way too much too little are you

6129
03:24:59,439 --> 03:25:02,800
excited about this thing

6130
03:25:01,200 --> 03:25:04,640
it's it's sufficiently different from

6131
03:25:02,799 --> 03:25:06,238
what i do in my field that it's

6132
03:25:04,639 --> 03:25:08,719
incredibly interesting to me because

6133
03:25:06,238 --> 03:25:10,959
it's it's i have no you know horse in

6134
03:25:08,719 --> 03:25:13,039
that race and so i'm not competing with

6135
03:25:10,959 --> 03:25:15,759
them for time or money or resources or

6136
03:25:13,040 --> 03:25:18,880
people or whatever so i can purely be

6137
03:25:15,760 --> 03:25:20,880
an advocate and an aficionado of science

6138
03:25:18,879 --> 03:25:23,119
it is in some sense the successor to

6139
03:25:20,879 --> 03:25:24,478
hubble it will do things that hubble

6140
03:25:23,120 --> 03:25:26,560
can't do

6141
03:25:24,478 --> 03:25:29,119
it will also may or may not have the

6142
03:25:26,559 --> 03:25:31,359
impact on a visceral

6143
03:25:29,120 --> 03:25:32,800
kind of artistic level that hubble had

6144
03:25:31,359 --> 03:25:34,079
what are some of the most iconic things

6145
03:25:32,799 --> 03:25:36,159
that hubble did

6146
03:25:34,079 --> 03:25:39,039
the hubble ultra deep field the pillars

6147
03:25:36,159 --> 03:25:41,279
of creation you know storms and and

6148
03:25:39,040 --> 03:25:43,840
imaging and of these twisted deep galax

6149
03:25:41,279 --> 03:25:44,880
deep sky galaxies those resonated with

6150
03:25:43,840 --> 03:25:46,880
the public

6151
03:25:44,879 --> 03:25:48,799
just visually they were beautiful

6152
03:25:46,879 --> 03:25:50,639
yeah when you look at um these images

6153
03:25:48,799 --> 03:25:52,799
the hubble ultra deep field you'll maybe

6154
03:25:50,639 --> 03:25:55,439
put that in you'll show every speck of

6155
03:25:52,799 --> 03:25:57,679
light except for one 4 000 blobs of

6156
03:25:55,439 --> 03:26:00,238
light there's one star in our galaxy the

6157
03:25:57,680 --> 03:26:02,398
rest of galaxies now that image is less

6158
03:26:00,238 --> 03:26:04,799
than one tenth of your fingernail held

6159
03:26:02,398 --> 03:26:07,119
out at arm's length it contains 4 000

6160
03:26:04,799 --> 03:26:09,599
galaxies so now you can figure out how

6161
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:11,200
many galaxies there are in the whole sky

6162
03:26:09,600 --> 03:26:12,640
just by seeing how long does it take you

6163
03:26:11,200 --> 03:26:15,200
to move your fingernail over the whole

6164
03:26:12,639 --> 03:26:16,559
sky so we have another couple hours

6165
03:26:15,200 --> 03:26:18,880
no so it comes out to be that's how we

6166
03:26:16,559 --> 03:26:20,559
get 500 billion or more galaxies now

6167
03:26:18,879 --> 03:26:22,398
it's not exact to the galaxy but it's

6168
03:26:20,559 --> 03:26:24,000
it's it's a good order of magnitude

6169
03:26:22,398 --> 03:26:25,680
estimate maybe even better

6170
03:26:24,000 --> 03:26:27,279
um hubble produced that and it was

6171
03:26:25,680 --> 03:26:29,200
basically serendipitous they pointed to

6172
03:26:27,279 --> 03:26:30,880
some dark black piece of sky what they

6173
03:26:29,200 --> 03:26:32,560
thought was blank and they saw it same

6174
03:26:30,879 --> 03:26:33,679
thing that happened with the cmb they

6175
03:26:32,559 --> 03:26:35,199
were looking they were something they

6176
03:26:33,680 --> 03:26:37,200
didn't find same thing they found when

6177
03:26:35,200 --> 03:26:38,640
they were looking for the deceleration

6178
03:26:37,200 --> 03:26:42,159
of the universe and found it was

6179
03:26:38,639 --> 03:26:43,358
accelerating um so what i sometimes hear

6180
03:26:42,159 --> 03:26:45,439
is that we don't know what we're gonna

6181
03:26:43,359 --> 03:26:47,279
discover i never think that's a good

6182
03:26:45,439 --> 03:26:48,720
idea to spend billions of dollars on

6183
03:26:47,279 --> 03:26:50,880
something like you should have some

6184
03:26:48,719 --> 03:26:52,000
guaranteed low-hanging fruit

6185
03:26:50,879 --> 03:26:53,119
and then there should be swinging for

6186
03:26:52,000 --> 03:26:55,120
the fences

6187
03:26:53,120 --> 03:26:56,319
and i think in this case it was really

6188
03:26:55,120 --> 03:26:57,520
everything is swinging for the fences

6189
03:26:56,318 --> 03:26:59,439
because it's either it's kind of a

6190
03:26:57,520 --> 03:27:02,238
single point failure if that telescope

6191
03:26:59,439 --> 03:27:04,479
which is this origami construction of 22

6192
03:27:02,238 --> 03:27:06,879
hexagonal panels that have to unfold

6193
03:27:04,478 --> 03:27:08,478
properly and then orient themselves a

6194
03:27:06,879 --> 03:27:10,799
million miles from earth beyond the

6195
03:27:08,478 --> 03:27:12,879
earth moon distance by a factor of four

6196
03:27:10,799 --> 03:27:13,599
and and still transmit telecommunity you

6197
03:27:12,879 --> 03:27:15,278
know

6198
03:27:13,600 --> 03:27:17,279
telecommunication back to the earth get

6199
03:27:15,279 --> 03:27:18,319
solar energy keep it away from the sun

6200
03:27:17,279 --> 03:27:19,760
you know you don't want to look through

6201
03:27:18,318 --> 03:27:21,840
the telescope of the sun with your

6202
03:27:19,760 --> 03:27:24,079
remaining good eye and you do that and

6203
03:27:21,840 --> 03:27:27,760
you cover it's going to be phenomenal i

6204
03:27:24,079 --> 03:27:29,039
i um for science for sure if it works

6205
03:27:27,760 --> 03:27:31,279
there are a lot of people think you know

6206
03:27:29,040 --> 03:27:33,439
it's so risky it's such nasa sunk so

6207
03:27:31,279 --> 03:27:34,880
much of their budget it ate up you know

6208
03:27:33,439 --> 03:27:37,279
and what if it does fail i mean there's

6209
03:27:34,879 --> 03:27:38,959
no guarantee yes it's insured but so

6210
03:27:37,279 --> 03:27:40,720
what you're not gonna get back those 20

6211
03:27:38,959 --> 03:27:42,238
years of people let's start building it

6212
03:27:40,719 --> 03:27:46,879
again like they didn't build two copies

6213
03:27:42,238 --> 03:27:49,119
of it um and then if it fails it kind of

6214
03:27:46,879 --> 03:27:49,920
has a dampening effect

6215
03:27:49,120 --> 03:27:51,520
on

6216
03:27:49,920 --> 03:27:53,279
the prospects and the inspiration of the

6217
03:27:51,520 --> 03:27:55,840
public for the what science can do what

6218
03:27:53,279 --> 03:27:57,040
science engineering can do is out in

6219
03:27:55,840 --> 03:27:58,238
it will make a huge impact

6220
03:27:57,040 --> 03:28:00,080
scientifically let's hope for the best

6221
03:27:58,238 --> 03:28:02,719
let's assume it does succeed it's

6222
03:28:00,079 --> 03:28:04,799
launched in a couple weeks and um and

6223
03:28:02,719 --> 03:28:06,398
when it does it will transform our

6224
03:28:04,799 --> 03:28:09,278
understanding of you know we just

6225
03:28:06,398 --> 03:28:11,199
discovered not only like extrasolar

6226
03:28:09,279 --> 03:28:12,560
planets that have moons on them an

6227
03:28:11,200 --> 03:28:15,040
asteroid belt we discovered an

6228
03:28:12,559 --> 03:28:16,639
extrasolar planet in another galaxy this

6229
03:28:15,040 --> 03:28:20,000
will be able to see crazy stuff like

6230
03:28:16,639 --> 03:28:21,680
that spectroscopy imaging um but but

6231
03:28:20,000 --> 03:28:23,680
it's and it will be able to go back

6232
03:28:21,680 --> 03:28:25,680
farther in time such that we will be

6233
03:28:23,680 --> 03:28:26,960
doing cosmo like hubble did some

6234
03:28:25,680 --> 03:28:28,479
cosmology and measured the hubble

6235
03:28:26,959 --> 03:28:31,358
constant that was its key project when

6236
03:28:28,478 --> 03:28:33,438
it was designed and launched um but

6237
03:28:31,359 --> 03:28:35,120
because it is optical telescope it's

6238
03:28:33,439 --> 03:28:37,600
sensitive to more you know close in

6239
03:28:35,120 --> 03:28:39,439
redshift so shorter distances now james

6240
03:28:37,600 --> 03:28:42,159
webb is much much higher redshift it can

6241
03:28:39,439 --> 03:28:43,920
probe the darker deeper distant universe

6242
03:28:42,159 --> 03:28:47,119
okay let's talk about not the distant

6243
03:28:43,920 --> 03:28:50,840
universe but our neighboring planets

6244
03:28:47,120 --> 03:28:53,920
first i gotta ask you about the moon

6245
03:28:50,840 --> 03:28:56,000
um so there's a there's a piece of the

6246
03:28:53,920 --> 03:28:58,478
moon on this table that you've given me

6247
03:28:56,000 --> 03:29:00,799
yes uh that we didn't have to pick up

6248
03:28:58,478 --> 03:29:02,559
that arrived here that's right so how

6249
03:29:00,799 --> 03:29:05,599
did a piece of the moon arrive here on

6250
03:29:02,559 --> 03:29:07,920
earth so this chunk of the moon if it

6251
03:29:05,600 --> 03:29:10,479
were delivered by

6252
03:29:07,920 --> 03:29:12,639
the apollo and nasa emissions uh you and

6253
03:29:10,478 --> 03:29:14,238
i would be guilty of a felony right now

6254
03:29:12,639 --> 03:29:16,398
because illegal to own pieces of the

6255
03:29:14,238 --> 03:29:18,000
moon collected by the apollo astronauts

6256
03:29:16,398 --> 03:29:19,519
so don't even joke about that when you

6257
03:29:18,000 --> 03:29:21,200
go over to houston

6258
03:29:19,520 --> 03:29:24,399
this piece of moon rock was delivered

6259
03:29:21,200 --> 03:29:26,800
via the old-fashioned way by gravity so

6260
03:29:24,398 --> 03:29:28,799
this was a chunk of the moon which is

6261
03:29:26,799 --> 03:29:31,679
blasted off because the moon gets

6262
03:29:28,799 --> 03:29:33,358
bombarded by asteroids and meteoroids

6263
03:29:31,680 --> 03:29:36,079
some of them eject material from the

6264
03:29:33,359 --> 03:29:39,120
surface of the moon into space

6265
03:29:36,079 --> 03:29:41,039
and it will then orbit the common uh

6266
03:29:39,120 --> 03:29:42,960
moon earth system

6267
03:29:41,040 --> 03:29:45,200
and it will then eventually enter our

6268
03:29:42,959 --> 03:29:46,639
atmosphere and if the piece is large

6269
03:29:45,200 --> 03:29:48,640
enough and the trajectory is proper it

6270
03:29:46,639 --> 03:29:51,599
can land intact and this one landed with

6271
03:29:48,639 --> 03:29:54,238
a few uh 100 grams worth and they sliced

6272
03:29:51,600 --> 03:29:56,559
it up and then it was delivered via us

6273
03:29:54,238 --> 03:29:58,159
postal service to my house so you can

6274
03:29:56,559 --> 03:30:00,238
buy these pieces and actually can buy a

6275
03:29:58,159 --> 03:30:02,559
piece of mars you can buy a piece of

6276
03:30:00,238 --> 03:30:04,159
mars delivered by the same route

6277
03:30:02,559 --> 03:30:06,478
now what's so interesting about that

6278
03:30:04,159 --> 03:30:08,398
well if a piece of mars can get here a

6279
03:30:06,478 --> 03:30:10,719
piece of earth can get there

6280
03:30:08,398 --> 03:30:13,039
if some piece of earth has some life

6281
03:30:10,719 --> 03:30:14,398
forms on it it could get there and if

6282
03:30:13,040 --> 03:30:16,399
that can happen in our solar system it

6283
03:30:14,398 --> 03:30:18,639
could happen throughout the galaxy

6284
03:30:16,398 --> 03:30:21,199
so i'm actually not of the opinion that

6285
03:30:18,639 --> 03:30:23,278
there is life elsewhere in the universe

6286
03:30:21,200 --> 03:30:24,800
at least technological life that we can

6287
03:30:23,279 --> 03:30:27,439
see i see this look of horror on your

6288
03:30:24,799 --> 03:30:30,000
face um i view it

6289
03:30:27,439 --> 03:30:31,920
i am personally extremely pessimistic

6290
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:34,398
would be extremely surprised i'm just

6291
03:30:31,920 --> 03:30:37,279
i'm curious by the transition

6292
03:30:34,398 --> 03:30:39,519
because you just said that life

6293
03:30:37,279 --> 03:30:41,279
could have arrived from mars or like

6294
03:30:39,520 --> 03:30:43,359
from planet to planet but because of the

6295
03:30:41,279 --> 03:30:45,040
meteorites striking and so on yeah and

6296
03:30:43,359 --> 03:30:46,399
then you went to

6297
03:30:45,040 --> 03:30:47,760
you don't think there

6298
03:30:46,398 --> 03:30:49,680
there might be life out there in the

6299
03:30:47,760 --> 03:30:51,600
universe technological life

6300
03:30:49,680 --> 03:30:52,880
technological life

6301
03:30:51,600 --> 03:30:54,399
like yeah advanced intelligence

6302
03:30:52,879 --> 03:30:57,599
civilizations okay

6303
03:30:54,398 --> 03:30:59,599
uh yeah okay so go on yeah so that's a

6304
03:30:57,600 --> 03:31:01,520
the generalization of what uh the famous

6305
03:30:59,600 --> 03:31:04,559
astronomer fred hoyle called i know this

6306
03:31:01,520 --> 03:31:07,439
is a pg-13 it's called panspermia

6307
03:31:04,559 --> 03:31:10,799
panspermia and uh beep that up yeah yeah

6308
03:31:07,439 --> 03:31:13,200
please and uh that's the exchange of

6309
03:31:10,799 --> 03:31:14,959
genetic life for material from

6310
03:31:13,200 --> 03:31:17,120
other reaches on earth which explains

6311
03:31:14,959 --> 03:31:18,959
the origin of life on earth but not the

6312
03:31:17,120 --> 03:31:20,640
origin of life itself which i think is a

6313
03:31:18,959 --> 03:31:22,079
much grander mystery and much more

6314
03:31:20,639 --> 03:31:23,680
interesting

6315
03:31:22,079 --> 03:31:25,760
how did life get here and you've talked

6316
03:31:23,680 --> 03:31:27,040
with many eminent people about that

6317
03:31:25,760 --> 03:31:29,439
i'm not going to add that much but but

6318
03:31:27,040 --> 03:31:31,439
just thinking about the reverse process

6319
03:31:29,439 --> 03:31:32,559
let's say life started on the earth

6320
03:31:31,439 --> 03:31:33,920
somehow

6321
03:31:32,559 --> 03:31:36,000
and then made its way out into the

6322
03:31:33,920 --> 03:31:38,079
universe is there enough time for the

6323
03:31:36,000 --> 03:31:40,879
whatever material went from earth via

6324
03:31:38,079 --> 03:31:43,039
panspermic direction you know spraying

6325
03:31:40,879 --> 03:31:45,039
the love gun out into the universe did

6326
03:31:43,040 --> 03:31:46,720
that then have enough time to incubate

6327
03:31:45,040 --> 03:31:49,520
and go on to a planet that could support

6328
03:31:46,719 --> 03:31:51,278
it certainly not within our solar system

6329
03:31:49,520 --> 03:31:52,560
which traveling at the meteorite speeds

6330
03:31:51,279 --> 03:31:54,560
would require you know hundreds of

6331
03:31:52,559 --> 03:31:56,719
millions of years then looking at the

6332
03:31:54,559 --> 03:31:57,680
evolutionary history from bacteria to

6333
03:31:56,719 --> 03:31:59,039
bach

6334
03:31:57,680 --> 03:32:00,960
from you know

6335
03:31:59,040 --> 03:32:02,800
rocks to rock mononof i don't know i can

6336
03:32:00,959 --> 03:32:04,959
do this all day oh wow it's pretty good

6337
03:32:02,799 --> 03:32:06,799
how do you get from those very simple

6338
03:32:04,959 --> 03:32:08,079
inanimate objects to like i just simply

6339
03:32:06,799 --> 03:32:09,840
think there's not enough time for earth

6340
03:32:08,079 --> 03:32:10,879
to seed life technological life

6341
03:32:09,840 --> 03:32:13,520
throughout the galaxy i don't think

6342
03:32:10,879 --> 03:32:16,238
there's any evidence for that but so you

6343
03:32:13,520 --> 03:32:18,000
you really think that the origin of of

6344
03:32:16,238 --> 03:32:20,959
life on earth

6345
03:32:18,000 --> 03:32:23,520
is a really special event yeah if it did

6346
03:32:20,959 --> 03:32:26,159
originate on earth my question for those

6347
03:32:23,520 --> 03:32:28,479
that search for life outside the earth

6348
03:32:26,159 --> 03:32:31,600
is what if you had a letter from god and

6349
03:32:28,478 --> 03:32:33,679
the letter said um life didn't originate

6350
03:32:31,600 --> 03:32:35,520
on earth like would you

6351
03:32:33,680 --> 03:32:36,880
choose a different profession like it

6352
03:32:35,520 --> 03:32:38,560
would seem hopeless like in other words

6353
03:32:36,879 --> 03:32:40,318
we only have a sample of one in fact we

6354
03:32:38,559 --> 03:32:42,159
only know of one conscious life form let

6355
03:32:40,318 --> 03:32:43,600
alone one planet that has life on it

6356
03:32:42,159 --> 03:32:45,760
right what if you knew for sure it

6357
03:32:43,600 --> 03:32:48,479
didn't start here that means that like

6358
03:32:45,760 --> 03:32:51,359
there's almost nothing about earth that

6359
03:32:48,478 --> 03:32:53,199
is um originated it didn't originate the

6360
03:32:51,359 --> 03:32:54,720
life process so to study purely the

6361
03:32:53,200 --> 03:32:56,319
origin of life not life itself i think

6362
03:32:54,719 --> 03:32:59,119
that's still fascinating but how could

6363
03:32:56,318 --> 03:33:00,639
we learn about you know the origin of of

6364
03:32:59,120 --> 03:33:03,040
remember you have to go from inanimate

6365
03:33:00,639 --> 03:33:04,639
object to a living object whatever that

6366
03:33:03,040 --> 03:33:07,439
definition of life is and i'm not an

6367
03:33:04,639 --> 03:33:10,159
expert in many definitions max sarah you

6368
03:33:07,439 --> 03:33:12,479
know many different uh definitions but

6369
03:33:10,159 --> 03:33:14,238
but how do you actually go from from

6370
03:33:12,478 --> 03:33:16,159
from inanimate to animate it's a huge

6371
03:33:14,238 --> 03:33:19,039
question yeah but then you don't have to

6372
03:33:16,159 --> 03:33:21,600
be the place where life originated to

6373
03:33:19,040 --> 03:33:23,040
replicate the origin or to under like uh

6374
03:33:21,600 --> 03:33:24,479
yeah that's one way to understand

6375
03:33:23,040 --> 03:33:26,720
something is to

6376
03:33:24,478 --> 03:33:29,039
uh build it yeah but another way is to

6377
03:33:26,719 --> 03:33:32,879
just observe it you don't have to truly

6378
03:33:29,040 --> 03:33:34,560
re-uh re-engineer from scratch so

6379
03:33:32,879 --> 03:33:36,559
you know i

6380
03:33:34,559 --> 03:33:40,318
but then yes if it didn't originate on

6381
03:33:36,559 --> 03:33:43,439
earth then your intuitions about the

6382
03:33:40,318 --> 03:33:45,039
basic prerequisites of life are are off

6383
03:33:43,439 --> 03:33:47,359
what's the governing principle right

6384
03:33:45,040 --> 03:33:50,239
like me what is um and then you could

6385
03:33:47,359 --> 03:33:51,520
have just an almost an arbitrary number

6386
03:33:50,238 --> 03:33:52,398
of possible

6387
03:33:51,520 --> 03:33:56,079
like

6388
03:33:52,398 --> 03:33:56,079
if life didn't start on earth

6389
03:33:56,478 --> 03:34:02,079
to me that's exciting because it's like

6390
03:33:58,959 --> 03:34:04,079
we know even less than we thought

6391
03:34:02,079 --> 03:34:05,120
the thing is it can prosper on earth

6392
03:34:04,079 --> 03:34:07,760
though

6393
03:34:05,120 --> 03:34:09,840
yeah so maybe the origin of life is

6394
03:34:07,760 --> 03:34:11,920
fundamentally different from

6395
03:34:09,840 --> 03:34:14,880
the maintenance of life right and maybe

6396
03:34:11,920 --> 03:34:17,439
maybe the existence of the earth life

6397
03:34:14,879 --> 03:34:19,679
symbiosis is critical i think sarah you

6398
03:34:17,439 --> 03:34:22,479
talked about sarah walker um

6399
03:34:19,680 --> 03:34:23,920
that it's a planetary phenomenon etc so

6400
03:34:22,478 --> 03:34:25,760
doesn't that make it less like in other

6401
03:34:23,920 --> 03:34:29,520
words like not only do you need special

6402
03:34:25,760 --> 03:34:32,079
life conditions to create life but then

6403
03:34:29,520 --> 03:34:33,279
sustenance of life as you say that also

6404
03:34:32,079 --> 03:34:34,559
has to be

6405
03:34:33,279 --> 03:34:36,800
maintained under very specific

6406
03:34:34,559 --> 03:34:38,799
circumstances by very specific planets

6407
03:34:36,799 --> 03:34:40,159
and with very specific tectonic activity

6408
03:34:38,799 --> 03:34:42,478
and moon and by the way you need a

6409
03:34:40,159 --> 03:34:44,318
jupiter nearby you need an earth and a

6410
03:34:42,478 --> 03:34:46,478
moon system so that you don't get

6411
03:34:44,318 --> 03:34:48,639
bombarded too early and i always think

6412
03:34:46,478 --> 03:34:50,159
like this like technological life i

6413
03:34:48,639 --> 03:34:51,519
haven't said this before really soon i'm

6414
03:34:50,159 --> 03:34:52,799
just speaking i usually like to write

6415
03:34:51,520 --> 03:34:53,760
down before i say different things but

6416
03:34:52,799 --> 03:34:56,159
one of the things i thought about

6417
03:34:53,760 --> 03:34:57,760
somebody hosts a podcast you should

6418
03:34:56,159 --> 03:34:59,760
probably accept the fact that you're

6419
03:34:57,760 --> 03:35:01,920
going to say stupid things every once in

6420
03:34:59,760 --> 03:35:05,120
a while not every once in a while every

6421
03:35:01,920 --> 03:35:07,760
while i claim that you know to get to

6422
03:35:05,120 --> 03:35:10,319
sending you know people to the moon

6423
03:35:07,760 --> 03:35:12,478
you know our planet needed whales and

6424
03:35:10,318 --> 03:35:14,559
and dinosaurs right like you don't make

6425
03:35:12,478 --> 03:35:16,079
a solar panel from another solar panel

6426
03:35:14,559 --> 03:35:19,199
like you made a solar panel from a

6427
03:35:16,079 --> 03:35:20,879
factory that melted down glass silica

6428
03:35:19,200 --> 03:35:22,479
you know aluminum extruded that using

6429
03:35:20,879 --> 03:35:24,879
fossil fuels where do those fossil fuels

6430
03:35:22,478 --> 03:35:26,318
come from like so any civilization

6431
03:35:24,879 --> 03:35:28,000
that's going to be a dyson you know

6432
03:35:26,318 --> 03:35:29,680
kardashev

6433
03:35:28,000 --> 03:35:31,520
did they have dinosaurs like do they

6434
03:35:29,680 --> 03:35:34,000
have like prebiotic life do they have a

6435
03:35:31,520 --> 03:35:37,200
great oxygenation event did they have a

6436
03:35:34,000 --> 03:35:38,959
dimorphism between prokaryotic eukaryote

6437
03:35:37,200 --> 03:35:40,720
all those hurdles they give each one

6438
03:35:38,959 --> 03:35:42,318
let's say there's eight hurdles

6439
03:35:40,719 --> 03:35:44,159
and each one of those has a probability

6440
03:35:42,318 --> 03:35:46,639
of one in a thousand to go from you know

6441
03:35:44,159 --> 03:35:48,079
uh eukaryotic prokaryote whatever let's

6442
03:35:46,639 --> 03:35:50,000
say there's a one in a thousand chance i

6443
03:35:48,079 --> 03:35:51,200
think it's like one in 10 to the 40th or

6444
03:35:50,000 --> 03:35:53,439
whatever if you really do it but let's

6445
03:35:51,200 --> 03:35:54,800
say it's first generous nature one in

6446
03:35:53,439 --> 03:35:56,800
ten to the three

6447
03:35:54,799 --> 03:35:58,398
let's say there's eight of those hurdles

6448
03:35:56,799 --> 03:36:00,639
that means you have you know 10 to the

6449
03:35:58,398 --> 03:36:02,238
to the to the 24th power

6450
03:36:00,639 --> 03:36:04,318
uh different

6451
03:36:02,238 --> 03:36:05,920
possibility and that's just with eight

6452
03:36:04,318 --> 03:36:07,278
like the moon has to be there jupiter

6453
03:36:05,920 --> 03:36:08,559
has to be there dinosaurs had to be

6454
03:36:07,279 --> 03:36:10,800
there all the different things that we

6455
03:36:08,559 --> 03:36:12,959
have to get to technological life

6456
03:36:10,799 --> 03:36:16,639
there's only 10 to the 2 only there's 10

6457
03:36:12,959 --> 03:36:18,879
to the 22nd we think earth not earth

6458
03:36:16,639 --> 03:36:21,680
planets in the observable universe not

6459
03:36:18,879 --> 03:36:24,079
the galaxy so that's a hundred times

6460
03:36:21,680 --> 03:36:26,238
fewer than the probability to get you

6461
03:36:24,079 --> 03:36:28,559
know 100 percent clearing these eight

6462
03:36:26,238 --> 03:36:30,398
very low hurdles of one in a thousand

6463
03:36:28,559 --> 03:36:31,920
that's fascinating because now i really

6464
03:36:30,398 --> 03:36:34,079
need to listen to your conversation with

6465
03:36:31,920 --> 03:36:37,439
lee cronin who i believe you had

6466
03:36:34,079 --> 03:36:39,600
because he believes the opposite yes

6467
03:36:37,439 --> 03:36:41,520
yeah i want to have a debate with him

6468
03:36:39,600 --> 03:36:42,479
he believes

6469
03:36:41,520 --> 03:36:45,359
that

6470
03:36:42,478 --> 03:36:47,358
the the way biology evolved on earth

6471
03:36:45,359 --> 03:36:49,760
could have evolved almost an infinite

6472
03:36:47,359 --> 03:36:51,439
number of other ways so like if you ran

6473
03:36:49,760 --> 03:36:53,200
earth over and over and over you would

6474
03:36:51,439 --> 03:36:54,159
keep getting life and it would be very

6475
03:36:53,200 --> 03:36:55,520
different

6476
03:36:54,159 --> 03:36:57,200
so it's

6477
03:36:55,520 --> 03:36:59,920
the the fact that our

6478
03:36:57,200 --> 03:37:01,920
particular life seems unique

6479
03:36:59,920 --> 03:37:03,760
is just like well because every freaking

6480
03:37:01,920 --> 03:37:06,000
life is gonna seem unique but you know

6481
03:37:03,760 --> 03:37:08,079
be very different it's not like

6482
03:37:06,000 --> 03:37:09,760
we shouldn't be asking the question of

6483
03:37:08,079 --> 03:37:12,799
what's the likelihood of getting a

6484
03:37:09,760 --> 03:37:15,200
human-like thing

6485
03:37:12,799 --> 03:37:16,639
because that seems to be super special

6486
03:37:15,200 --> 03:37:18,399
it's more like

6487
03:37:16,639 --> 03:37:21,439
um

6488
03:37:18,398 --> 03:37:23,840
how easy is it to make

6489
03:37:21,439 --> 03:37:25,520
anything that has the skills of a human

6490
03:37:23,840 --> 03:37:26,639
and i don't mean like something with

6491
03:37:25,520 --> 03:37:28,560
thumbs but

6492
03:37:26,639 --> 03:37:30,879
achieving basically a technological

6493
03:37:28,559 --> 03:37:33,920
civilization and according to lee at

6494
03:37:30,879 --> 03:37:35,679
least it's like it's it's trivial i know

6495
03:37:33,920 --> 03:37:36,639
we fought i fought a little bit i'd love

6496
03:37:35,680 --> 03:37:38,000
to debate him and i think it'll be a lot

6497
03:37:36,639 --> 03:37:39,358
of fun because we debate with love when

6498
03:37:38,000 --> 03:37:41,520
i talk with lee i love him and he loves

6499
03:37:39,359 --> 03:37:44,238
me i think i hope but let me ask you a

6500
03:37:41,520 --> 03:37:46,319
question i asked this of him and sarah

6501
03:37:44,238 --> 03:37:47,760
on our clubhouse once so what do you

6502
03:37:46,318 --> 03:37:50,000
think would happen the next day let's

6503
03:37:47,760 --> 03:37:52,159
say we discovered life

6504
03:37:50,000 --> 03:37:53,439
it's proxima centauri b

6505
03:37:52,159 --> 03:37:55,039
it's um

6506
03:37:53,439 --> 03:37:57,600
it looks just like slime mold like you

6507
03:37:55,040 --> 03:37:58,720
got on your brie cheese or whatever

6508
03:37:57,600 --> 03:38:01,200
we discover

6509
03:37:58,719 --> 03:38:02,799
what would happen the next day

6510
03:38:01,200 --> 03:38:04,800
and they were like oh this would be

6511
03:38:02,799 --> 03:38:06,639
transformative and and i'm not trying to

6512
03:38:04,799 --> 03:38:08,159
be like you know total cassandra about

6513
03:38:06,639 --> 03:38:09,840
this but i said i don't think anything

6514
03:38:08,159 --> 03:38:10,959
would happen

6515
03:38:09,840 --> 03:38:13,200
what are you talking about

6516
03:38:10,959 --> 03:38:15,278
transformational i'm like i stipulate

6517
03:38:13,200 --> 03:38:16,880
that life exists go down to like the

6518
03:38:15,279 --> 03:38:19,520
river you know i'm in san diego go out

6519
03:38:16,879 --> 03:38:22,000
to the pacific ocean scoop up a glass

6520
03:38:19,520 --> 03:38:23,760
you know um you're gonna find life in

6521
03:38:22,000 --> 03:38:25,200
there and what are we doing what are we

6522
03:38:23,760 --> 03:38:27,920
doing to our earth

6523
03:38:25,200 --> 03:38:29,279
we're destroying it callously we're like

6524
03:38:27,920 --> 03:38:30,799
pumping crap into there like we have

6525
03:38:29,279 --> 03:38:32,000
this toxic waste spill a couple months

6526
03:38:30,799 --> 03:38:33,438
ago in san diego i couldn't go to the

6527
03:38:32,000 --> 03:38:35,279
beach

6528
03:38:33,439 --> 03:38:36,720
let me take it a step further you know

6529
03:38:35,279 --> 03:38:38,399
how many you know how many people i'm

6530
03:38:36,719 --> 03:38:40,639
sorry that you do know but how many

6531
03:38:38,398 --> 03:38:42,478
people died in the 20th century

6532
03:38:40,639 --> 03:38:44,000
killed these are advanced civils this

6533
03:38:42,478 --> 03:38:46,799
isn't slime mold

6534
03:38:44,000 --> 03:38:48,079
we kill we maim we harm we hurt

6535
03:38:46,799 --> 03:38:49,278
we hate

6536
03:38:48,079 --> 03:38:51,120
i don't think anything would happen the

6537
03:38:49,279 --> 03:38:52,800
next day then we go back to what we had

6538
03:38:51,120 --> 03:38:54,640
and i said if that weren't proof enough

6539
03:38:52,799 --> 03:38:56,159
life has been discovered at least two or

6540
03:38:54,639 --> 03:38:58,559
three times just in my professional

6541
03:38:56,159 --> 03:39:00,398
career once in 1996

6542
03:38:58,559 --> 03:39:02,478
these allen land hills meteorites in

6543
03:39:00,398 --> 03:39:04,959
antarctica they saw like microbial

6544
03:39:02,478 --> 03:39:06,559
respiration processes still we don't

6545
03:39:04,959 --> 03:39:08,000
know it was a press conference held by

6546
03:39:06,559 --> 03:39:10,559
bill clinton on the white house lawn

6547
03:39:08,000 --> 03:39:12,799
that's featured in the movie contact um

6548
03:39:10,559 --> 03:39:14,799
repurposed for that movie

6549
03:39:12,799 --> 03:39:17,119
and um and then there's uh and then

6550
03:39:14,799 --> 03:39:19,679
there's this um the this phosphorus life

6551
03:39:17,120 --> 03:39:20,880
this this toxic life in the pools of

6552
03:39:19,680 --> 03:39:23,040
mono lake

6553
03:39:20,879 --> 03:39:24,159
many you know extremophile we don't give

6554
03:39:23,040 --> 03:39:26,479
a crap

6555
03:39:24,159 --> 03:39:28,398
we continue to so why are we thinking

6556
03:39:26,478 --> 03:39:30,559
that like our salvati from whence will

6557
03:39:28,398 --> 03:39:32,478
our salvation come as the bible says

6558
03:39:30,559 --> 03:39:34,398
like it's not going to change how we are

6559
03:39:32,478 --> 03:39:37,119
it's not going to magnify how i treat

6560
03:39:34,398 --> 03:39:38,559
you or you treat me and and we're pretty

6561
03:39:37,120 --> 03:39:40,239
knowledgeable people you and i compared

6562
03:39:38,559 --> 03:39:41,359
to you know lay people okay that's

6563
03:39:40,238 --> 03:39:43,520
interesting that's a really interesting

6564
03:39:41,359 --> 03:39:44,399
argument i i wonder if you're right but

6565
03:39:43,520 --> 03:39:46,479
my

6566
03:39:44,398 --> 03:39:48,079
intuition is

6567
03:39:46,478 --> 03:39:50,238
and i can

6568
03:39:48,079 --> 03:39:52,238
i can maybe present a different argument

6569
03:39:50,238 --> 03:39:54,959
that you can think about in the realm of

6570
03:39:52,238 --> 03:39:57,039
things you care about even deeper which

6571
03:39:54,959 --> 03:39:58,959
is like what happens once we figure out

6572
03:39:57,040 --> 03:40:00,640
the origins of the universe like how

6573
03:39:58,959 --> 03:40:02,000
would that change your life

6574
03:40:00,639 --> 03:40:04,879
i would say there are certain

6575
03:40:02,000 --> 03:40:07,680
discoveries that even in their very idea

6576
03:40:04,879 --> 03:40:10,000
will change the fabric of society i tend

6577
03:40:07,680 --> 03:40:12,079
to see if there's definitive proof

6578
03:40:10,000 --> 03:40:14,000
that there's life and the more complex

6579
03:40:12,079 --> 03:40:16,639
the more powerful that

6580
03:40:14,000 --> 03:40:19,120
idea is elsewhere

6581
03:40:16,639 --> 03:40:20,959
that i'm not exactly sure how it will

6582
03:40:19,120 --> 03:40:24,479
change society

6583
03:40:20,959 --> 03:40:26,879
um because it's such a slap in the face

6584
03:40:24,478 --> 03:40:29,438
it's like a such a humbling force or

6585
03:40:26,879 --> 03:40:30,398
maybe not or maybe it's a motivator to

6586
03:40:29,439 --> 03:40:32,318
say

6587
03:40:30,398 --> 03:40:34,159
um yeah i don't know which force would

6588
03:40:32,318 --> 03:40:35,680
take over maybe it would be governments

6589
03:40:34,159 --> 03:40:37,840
with military

6590
03:40:35,680 --> 03:40:40,079
uh start to think like well

6591
03:40:37,840 --> 03:40:41,520
how do we kill it

6592
03:40:40,079 --> 03:40:43,199
if there's a lot of life out there how

6593
03:40:41,520 --> 03:40:46,640
do we create the defenses how do we

6594
03:40:43,199 --> 03:40:47,840
extract it or or yeah or mine it for for

6595
03:40:46,639 --> 03:40:49,599
benefits

6596
03:40:47,840 --> 03:40:51,680
i mean i just see like there's a hundred

6597
03:40:49,600 --> 03:40:52,559
million literal counter examples about i

6598
03:40:51,680 --> 03:40:55,520
mean

6599
03:40:52,559 --> 03:40:57,680
right now there's like like 700 million

6600
03:40:55,520 --> 03:40:59,680
kids in poverty and like we just how do

6601
03:40:57,680 --> 03:41:01,680
we go about our life and just not deal

6602
03:40:59,680 --> 03:41:04,000
with that i mean i look i put it aside i

6603
03:41:01,680 --> 03:41:06,000
eat hamburgers and you know in 100 years

6604
03:41:04,000 --> 03:41:08,238
i'll be canceled for being a you know a

6605
03:41:06,000 --> 03:41:09,760
carnivore or whatever but you know so

6606
03:41:08,238 --> 03:41:10,879
obviously to get through life you have

6607
03:41:09,760 --> 03:41:12,960
to make certain compromise you're not

6608
03:41:10,879 --> 03:41:15,198
going to think about certain things but

6609
03:41:12,959 --> 03:41:16,959
i i i just think there is a sort of wish

6610
03:41:15,199 --> 03:41:18,319
fulfillment like every time there's why

6611
03:41:16,959 --> 03:41:20,159
are we going to mars and digging and

6612
03:41:18,318 --> 03:41:22,079
flying this cool ass helicopter i'm

6613
03:41:20,159 --> 03:41:23,600
we're looking for water like stipulate

6614
03:41:22,079 --> 03:41:25,120
that water was there

6615
03:41:23,600 --> 03:41:26,640
like i believe there was water i think

6616
03:41:25,120 --> 03:41:28,800
we should invest again and see what the

6617
03:41:26,639 --> 03:41:30,159
geology was like but but don't you think

6618
03:41:28,799 --> 03:41:31,358
so so you're saying i don't think you're

6619
03:41:30,159 --> 03:41:33,039
going to get meaning from it that's all

6620
03:41:31,359 --> 03:41:34,720
i'm saying i i'm not saying it's not

6621
03:41:33,040 --> 03:41:37,199
worth doing i'm just saying there's a

6622
03:41:34,719 --> 03:41:40,238
wish fulfillment aspect that people will

6623
03:41:37,199 --> 03:41:42,159
find meaning for life from science okay

6624
03:41:40,238 --> 03:41:43,840
but

6625
03:41:42,159 --> 03:41:46,000
there's a there's a complicated line

6626
03:41:43,840 --> 03:41:47,760
here what what if it's this

6627
03:41:46,000 --> 03:41:49,600
intelligent civilization

6628
03:41:47,760 --> 03:41:51,680
living

6629
03:41:49,600 --> 03:41:54,559
obviously probably not on mars but

6630
03:41:51,680 --> 03:41:57,279
somewhere like uh in neighboring galaxy

6631
03:41:54,559 --> 03:42:00,318
that we uh sorry in in in the name in a

6632
03:41:57,279 --> 03:42:02,159
neighboring star star system

6633
03:42:00,318 --> 03:42:04,398
that we discover

6634
03:42:02,159 --> 03:42:07,039
don't you think that profound change in

6635
03:42:04,398 --> 03:42:08,959
meaning i mean i guess again i assume

6636
03:42:07,040 --> 03:42:10,399
that because of this pan ceramic process

6637
03:42:08,959 --> 03:42:12,238
or whatever that

6638
03:42:10,398 --> 03:42:14,318
the probability is much much greater

6639
03:42:12,238 --> 03:42:16,318
than zero i mean it's not one a hundred

6640
03:42:14,318 --> 03:42:17,920
percent but it's it's much likelier than

6641
03:42:16,318 --> 03:42:20,799
that that at least some living material

6642
03:42:17,920 --> 03:42:22,879
from earth has ejaculated itself into

6643
03:42:20,799 --> 03:42:23,759
the solar system into the universe right

6644
03:42:22,879 --> 03:42:25,599
into our guys

6645
03:42:23,760 --> 03:42:28,318
please

6646
03:42:25,600 --> 03:42:29,680
as well that's right so ice like the

6647
03:42:28,318 --> 03:42:31,119
fact that that could happen and that

6648
03:42:29,680 --> 03:42:32,720
you're holding a piece you know from a

6649
03:42:31,120 --> 03:42:34,880
planetary body and one that couldn't

6650
03:42:32,719 --> 03:42:36,879
support life as far as we know uh but i

6651
03:42:34,879 --> 03:42:38,398
could get next time if you're if you if

6652
03:42:36,879 --> 03:42:40,238
you play nice and you come on my podcast

6653
03:42:38,398 --> 03:42:42,398
someday i will give you a tiny chunk of

6654
03:42:40,238 --> 03:42:44,639
mars so mars theoretically could support

6655
03:42:42,398 --> 03:42:46,079
stuff right now so yeah so i believe

6656
03:42:44,639 --> 03:42:47,599
that there's there could be remnants of

6657
03:42:46,079 --> 03:42:49,600
earth in this so so that means there

6658
03:42:47,600 --> 03:42:51,279
could be evolution i don't think there's

6659
03:42:49,600 --> 03:42:53,359
any chance that there's like you know

6660
03:42:51,279 --> 03:42:54,560
people using iphones and having podcasts

6661
03:42:53,359 --> 03:42:56,238
and stuff and probably so there's this

6662
03:42:54,559 --> 03:42:58,559
interesting there's so much some chance

6663
03:42:56,238 --> 03:43:00,879
though right

6664
03:42:58,559 --> 03:43:02,398
so again yes i think the pro well

6665
03:43:00,879 --> 03:43:04,238
obviously the simple state statement to

6666
03:43:02,398 --> 03:43:05,599
say it's much much much higher

6667
03:43:04,238 --> 03:43:07,600
probability that life exists and

6668
03:43:05,600 --> 03:43:09,520
technological life exists right i don't

6669
03:43:07,600 --> 03:43:10,960
think we can argue that um it doesn't

6670
03:43:09,520 --> 03:43:12,319
mean it's forbidden again i'm not saying

6671
03:43:10,959 --> 03:43:13,759
any of this is forbidden not worth

6672
03:43:12,318 --> 03:43:15,840
studying not interesting it's a

6673
03:43:13,760 --> 03:43:17,760
likelihood thing yeah and to answer your

6674
03:43:15,840 --> 03:43:20,000
i think you're wise to push back and

6675
03:43:17,760 --> 03:43:21,760
like what does it matter what i'm doing

6676
03:43:20,000 --> 03:43:23,279
and i like to think about that you know

6677
03:43:21,760 --> 03:43:24,800
because it's like what is the value of

6678
03:43:23,279 --> 03:43:26,560
what you're doing like you have to

6679
03:43:24,799 --> 03:43:27,438
answer that question or else at the end

6680
03:43:26,559 --> 03:43:29,840
of your life you'll have these

6681
03:43:27,439 --> 03:43:31,840
existential you know kind of crises

6682
03:43:29,840 --> 03:43:34,000
right so when i think about like who i

6683
03:43:31,840 --> 03:43:36,000
am part of my identity is answering and

6684
03:43:34,000 --> 03:43:37,600
asking scientific questions for me

6685
03:43:36,000 --> 03:43:40,159
though there is a religious kind of

6686
03:43:37,600 --> 03:43:42,318
undercurrent that does undergird in some

6687
03:43:40,159 --> 03:43:44,079
sense this quest again i'm not like a

6688
03:43:42,318 --> 03:43:46,959
practicing i'm not like wearing a you

6689
03:43:44,079 --> 03:43:49,520
know like i'm not like full-on into

6690
03:43:46,959 --> 03:43:52,079
my birth religion judaism

6691
03:43:49,520 --> 03:43:53,439
but at the same token i think as you

6692
03:43:52,079 --> 03:43:54,719
know one of the things einstein did say

6693
03:43:53,439 --> 03:43:57,920
is that you know religion without

6694
03:43:54,719 --> 03:44:01,198
science is blind and uh or is lame and

6695
03:43:57,920 --> 03:44:03,199
uh science without religion is lame it's

6696
03:44:01,199 --> 03:44:05,359
blind and lame anyway the point is that

6697
03:44:03,199 --> 03:44:07,439
like you can't get meaning

6698
03:44:05,359 --> 03:44:09,600
um you know from just knowing facts like

6699
03:44:07,439 --> 03:44:11,680
wikipedia knows more than all of us will

6700
03:44:09,600 --> 03:44:13,840
ever know right it has no wisdom you

6701
03:44:11,680 --> 03:44:15,920
know wisdom it means you know sapien the

6702
03:44:13,840 --> 03:44:17,920
word wisdom in latin and sapient we are

6703
03:44:15,920 --> 03:44:20,398
wise and by the way do you know what

6704
03:44:17,920 --> 03:44:22,559
we're what our real name is homo sapien

6705
03:44:20,398 --> 03:44:24,559
sapien so it's man who knows that he

6706
03:44:22,559 --> 03:44:26,000
knows do you know what he knows do you

6707
03:44:24,559 --> 03:44:27,278
know what the knowing is it's that he's

6708
03:44:26,000 --> 03:44:28,719
gonna die

6709
03:44:27,279 --> 03:44:30,000
we're the only creatures that know that

6710
03:44:28,719 --> 03:44:31,278
we are going to die we don't know when

6711
03:44:30,000 --> 03:44:33,760
we're going to die

6712
03:44:31,279 --> 03:44:36,560
but like you know i have a cat

6713
03:44:33,760 --> 03:44:38,079
a fierce attack cat is beautiful um she

6714
03:44:36,559 --> 03:44:39,600
doesn't know when she's going to die it

6715
03:44:38,079 --> 03:44:40,639
doesn't mean i'm more valuable than

6716
03:44:39,600 --> 03:44:42,640
surviving

6717
03:44:40,639 --> 03:44:44,318
the survival instinct is much it's

6718
03:44:42,639 --> 03:44:45,760
fundamentally different from like the

6719
03:44:44,318 --> 03:44:47,600
knowledge

6720
03:44:45,760 --> 03:44:49,760
of death and that's where ernest becker

6721
03:44:47,600 --> 03:44:52,000
comes in with the terror of death and

6722
03:44:49,760 --> 03:44:54,398
that that's a creative force

6723
03:44:52,000 --> 03:44:55,520
that um seems to be more feature than

6724
03:44:54,398 --> 03:44:56,478
bug

6725
03:44:55,520 --> 03:44:58,720
but the

6726
03:44:56,478 --> 03:45:00,238
human condition is that

6727
03:44:58,719 --> 03:45:02,159
um

6728
03:45:00,238 --> 03:45:03,600
i mean it's a gift

6729
03:45:02,159 --> 03:45:05,760
of knowing

6730
03:45:03,600 --> 03:45:09,439
our own mortality

6731
03:45:05,760 --> 03:45:11,520
um yeah to me i mean that's that's why

6732
03:45:09,439 --> 03:45:14,159
you know i i agree with you in some

6733
03:45:11,520 --> 03:45:17,040
sense in terms of the aliens not being a

6734
03:45:14,159 --> 03:45:19,119
thing that solves all mysteries

6735
03:45:17,040 --> 03:45:22,800
that's why you know my love has always

6736
03:45:19,120 --> 03:45:25,600
been the human mind so understanding

6737
03:45:22,799 --> 03:45:28,959
who we are what the hell are we and i

6738
03:45:25,600 --> 03:45:29,920
think your love has been an echo of that

6739
03:45:28,959 --> 03:45:33,519
which is

6740
03:45:29,920 --> 03:45:35,920
where did we come from yeah or basically

6741
03:45:33,520 --> 03:45:38,880
as cheesy as the songs you know

6742
03:45:35,920 --> 03:45:41,920
uh michio kaku is away with words i if

6743
03:45:38,879 --> 03:45:43,920
you if you can just like enjoy the

6744
03:45:41,920 --> 03:45:45,920
uh you know he speaks in complete he's

6745
03:45:43,920 --> 03:45:47,920
like sam harris of cosmology i mean he

6746
03:45:45,920 --> 03:45:50,159
speaks in complete paragraphs but like

6747
03:45:47,920 --> 03:45:53,040
also unapologetically

6748
03:45:50,159 --> 03:45:54,799
he says you know we will know god or

6749
03:45:53,040 --> 03:45:58,239
we'll know the mind of god or whatever

6750
03:45:54,799 --> 03:45:58,238
the quotes those kinds of things

6751
03:45:58,318 --> 03:46:03,359
that's exciting

6752
03:46:00,079 --> 03:46:06,398
that physics might be able to find

6753
03:46:03,359 --> 03:46:08,479
equations that unlock our origins

6754
03:46:06,398 --> 03:46:11,519
at the very core and like the fabric of

6755
03:46:08,478 --> 03:46:13,438
it all too and not just our origins

6756
03:46:11,520 --> 03:46:16,079
you know what's up you know what's at

6757
03:46:13,439 --> 03:46:18,079
the beginning um something tells me

6758
03:46:16,079 --> 03:46:19,920
we're too dumb to truly understand was

6759
03:46:18,079 --> 03:46:21,920
at the beginning but i think we should

6760
03:46:19,920 --> 03:46:24,000
be humble in that way i mean again

6761
03:46:21,920 --> 03:46:26,079
another thing is you know

6762
03:46:24,000 --> 03:46:30,079
you ever hear the saying like we shared

6763
03:46:26,079 --> 03:46:31,120
99 of our dna with chimps or bonobos or

6764
03:46:30,079 --> 03:46:32,959
whatever

6765
03:46:31,120 --> 03:46:35,359
i share like probably more than that you

6766
03:46:32,959 --> 03:46:36,639
know sometimes i wish we shared like 100

6767
03:46:35,359 --> 03:46:39,040
like that would be so much more

6768
03:46:36,639 --> 03:46:41,039
interesting like oh well there's 50 of a

6769
03:46:39,040 --> 03:46:43,279
fruit fly or banana like

6770
03:46:41,040 --> 03:46:45,199
no no there's something but that should

6771
03:46:43,279 --> 03:46:47,680
make us feel more precious and i almost

6772
03:46:45,199 --> 03:46:50,479
feel like discovering life on another

6773
03:46:47,680 --> 03:46:52,639
planet whatever solar system would cause

6774
03:46:50,478 --> 03:46:54,559
a diminution of humanity like the one

6775
03:46:52,639 --> 03:46:56,318
thing i do hold fast to from religion i

6776
03:46:54,559 --> 03:46:58,079
don't know where i am with god like do i

6777
03:46:56,318 --> 03:46:59,760
believe in god i think that's an

6778
03:46:58,079 --> 03:47:02,398
unanswerable question

6779
03:46:59,760 --> 03:47:04,559
um but but i have some thoughts about it

6780
03:47:02,398 --> 03:47:06,318
but by by the same token

6781
03:47:04,559 --> 03:47:07,600
i think the one thing i do get from

6782
03:47:06,318 --> 03:47:09,278
religion is that every human has

6783
03:47:07,600 --> 03:47:11,520
infinite worth because we are in a

6784
03:47:09,279 --> 03:47:13,840
religious capacity considered to be

6785
03:47:11,520 --> 03:47:15,680
equal to god in other words we are gods

6786
03:47:13,840 --> 03:47:17,680
not to be like you know but we can

6787
03:47:15,680 --> 03:47:19,439
contemplate what god did we have aspects

6788
03:47:17,680 --> 03:47:22,159
of god we have free will god had free

6789
03:47:19,439 --> 03:47:23,760
will uh if he exists again i can't prove

6790
03:47:22,159 --> 03:47:25,279
that god exists otherwise you wouldn't

6791
03:47:23,760 --> 03:47:27,840
have any credit for believing in god

6792
03:47:25,279 --> 03:47:29,680
this is interesting i mean

6793
03:47:27,840 --> 03:47:31,840
it's like i'm talking to einstein here

6794
03:47:29,680 --> 03:47:32,860
but let me ask anyway can you clip that

6795
03:47:31,840 --> 03:47:34,559
for my eclipse shop

6796
03:47:32,860 --> 03:47:37,760
[Laughter]

6797
03:47:34,559 --> 03:47:42,000
for somebody who's looking at the

6798
03:47:37,760 --> 03:47:42,000
young universe at the early universe

6799
03:47:42,318 --> 03:47:47,278
and are talking about god and are

6800
03:47:45,359 --> 03:47:50,800
agnostic

6801
03:47:47,279 --> 03:47:53,439
who do you think is god

6802
03:47:50,799 --> 03:47:56,079
so i thought you had just like one of

6803
03:47:53,439 --> 03:47:57,760
the best podcasts with sam harris this

6804
03:47:56,079 --> 03:48:00,079
past summer

6805
03:47:57,760 --> 03:48:01,680
and um one of the things i liked about

6806
03:48:00,079 --> 03:48:03,120
that conversation is he talked a lot

6807
03:48:01,680 --> 03:48:04,720
about happiness

6808
03:48:03,120 --> 03:48:05,920
and meditation

6809
03:48:04,719 --> 03:48:07,198
and he says something that's really

6810
03:48:05,920 --> 03:48:08,478
resonated with me and i've been working

6811
03:48:07,199 --> 03:48:11,120
around and trying to work out in my own

6812
03:48:08,478 --> 03:48:13,840
way but he said like you can never

6813
03:48:11,120 --> 03:48:16,079
you could never be

6814
03:48:13,840 --> 03:48:17,439
you could only become happy

6815
03:48:16,079 --> 03:48:18,799
and i'm trying to take a little bit

6816
03:48:17,439 --> 03:48:20,639
further than that because i think it's

6817
03:48:18,799 --> 03:48:22,478
it's interesting like meditation is like

6818
03:48:20,639 --> 03:48:24,478
you're not like oh i'm happy and now

6819
03:48:22,478 --> 03:48:26,159
like oh my kid came in and i'm not happy

6820
03:48:24,478 --> 03:48:27,920
they're like no like you can be

6821
03:48:26,159 --> 03:48:29,359
satisfied kurt vonnegut said like so you

6822
03:48:27,920 --> 03:48:30,719
ever catch us sometimes alex you're like

6823
03:48:29,359 --> 03:48:33,520
walking around you're like life is

6824
03:48:30,719 --> 03:48:35,358
freaking amazing like i'm happy and kurt

6825
03:48:33,520 --> 03:48:36,640
vonnegut said you should say to yourself

6826
03:48:35,359 --> 03:48:39,120
every time that happens like a little

6827
03:48:36,639 --> 03:48:41,198
mantra like if this isn't goodness if

6828
03:48:39,120 --> 03:48:43,359
this isn't happiness nothing is just

6829
03:48:41,199 --> 03:48:45,279
remind yourself how awesome it is every

6830
03:48:43,359 --> 03:48:46,800
breath everything that you do when you

6831
03:48:45,279 --> 03:48:49,840
make an impact even some of the bad

6832
03:48:46,799 --> 03:48:50,799
stuff that happens good it's good so sam

6833
03:48:49,840 --> 03:48:52,318
said that

6834
03:48:50,799 --> 03:48:53,278
and it made me think because i was like

6835
03:48:52,318 --> 03:48:54,959
well

6836
03:48:53,279 --> 03:48:58,159
what does it really mean

6837
03:48:54,959 --> 03:49:00,879
to to be happy uh because like i can

6838
03:48:58,159 --> 03:49:02,879
think of um i can think of about you

6839
03:49:00,879 --> 03:49:04,639
know two or three ways that right now i

6840
03:49:02,879 --> 03:49:06,079
could double my happiness

6841
03:49:04,639 --> 03:49:07,439
you know like when the lottery or

6842
03:49:06,079 --> 03:49:08,879
whatever like i could double my habit

6843
03:49:07,439 --> 03:49:09,760
there's only a few ways though right

6844
03:49:08,879 --> 03:49:11,438
like

6845
03:49:09,760 --> 03:49:13,199
you know i had uh

6846
03:49:11,439 --> 03:49:15,680
this this kind of thought like how many

6847
03:49:13,199 --> 03:49:17,279
boats can you water ski behind like you

6848
03:49:15,680 --> 03:49:19,359
had twice as many followers now you got

6849
03:49:17,279 --> 03:49:20,960
two million followers five mil whatever

6850
03:49:19,359 --> 03:49:22,559
it doesn't do anything it's called the

6851
03:49:20,959 --> 03:49:24,879
hedonic treadmill like once you get to a

6852
03:49:22,559 --> 03:49:27,359
certain level it takes a lot more you

6853
03:49:24,879 --> 03:49:29,920
know change and followers money impact

6854
03:49:27,359 --> 03:49:32,238
women whatever you want to make you have

6855
03:49:29,920 --> 03:49:33,600
one more quanta of happiness right on

6856
03:49:32,238 --> 03:49:36,079
the other hand

6857
03:49:33,600 --> 03:49:38,318
this is a concept from entropy

6858
03:49:36,079 --> 03:49:40,000
i can make your life miserable in an

6859
03:49:38,318 --> 03:49:41,840
infinite number of ways in other words

6860
03:49:40,000 --> 03:49:44,318
there's more space space to make your

6861
03:49:41,840 --> 03:49:45,600
life unhappy than happy

6862
03:49:44,318 --> 03:49:48,079
and so i thought about that in the

6863
03:49:45,600 --> 03:49:50,720
context of what sam said about happiness

6864
03:49:48,079 --> 03:49:53,279
um so it's sort of like yeah it's an

6865
03:49:50,719 --> 03:49:54,879
expression of entropy and that what you

6866
03:49:53,279 --> 03:49:56,960
should be doing in life

6867
03:49:54,879 --> 03:49:58,959
is doing that which

6868
03:49:56,959 --> 03:50:00,559
will cause you devastation

6869
03:49:58,959 --> 03:50:02,478
if it goes away

6870
03:50:00,559 --> 03:50:04,559
because those are the things that like

6871
03:50:02,478 --> 03:50:06,879
are where you're reducing

6872
03:50:04,559 --> 03:50:08,079
entropy like a kid like anyone who's a

6873
03:50:06,879 --> 03:50:10,238
parent

6874
03:50:08,079 --> 03:50:12,318
knows instantly what i'm talking about

6875
03:50:10,238 --> 03:50:13,600
like how to make your life a billion

6876
03:50:12,318 --> 03:50:14,799
times worse

6877
03:50:13,600 --> 03:50:16,399
but there's no way to make your life a

6878
03:50:14,799 --> 03:50:18,159
billion times better

6879
03:50:16,398 --> 03:50:20,959
and so thinking about that now turning

6880
03:50:18,159 --> 03:50:22,799
into the question of god's existence

6881
03:50:20,959 --> 03:50:24,238
i feel like there's no way that you can

6882
03:50:22,799 --> 03:50:26,799
believe in god

6883
03:50:24,238 --> 03:50:29,359
to quote misquote sam but there's ways

6884
03:50:26,799 --> 03:50:31,438
that you can become a believer in god in

6885
03:50:29,359 --> 03:50:34,000
other words you could increase the

6886
03:50:31,439 --> 03:50:35,600
bayesian confidence level that there is

6887
03:50:34,000 --> 03:50:37,040
some and let's not call it god because

6888
03:50:35,600 --> 03:50:39,439
that's a freighted term let's just call

6889
03:50:37,040 --> 03:50:41,760
it some infinite source of goodness or

6890
03:50:39,439 --> 03:50:42,639
our beautiful power in the universe

6891
03:50:41,760 --> 03:50:44,318
right

6892
03:50:42,639 --> 03:50:47,198
simple things can do that you can

6893
03:50:44,318 --> 03:50:49,519
increase your credulity in the goodness

6894
03:50:47,199 --> 03:50:51,120
of life and we have this bias as humans

6895
03:50:49,520 --> 03:50:52,880
towards negativity negativity bias

6896
03:50:51,120 --> 03:50:54,800
well-known fact

6897
03:50:52,879 --> 03:50:56,398
so what i want to do is

6898
03:50:54,799 --> 03:50:58,478
let's call god good right that's where

6899
03:50:56,398 --> 03:50:59,599
it comes from god good same words in

6900
03:50:58,478 --> 03:51:00,398
german

6901
03:50:59,600 --> 03:51:02,479
and

6902
03:51:00,398 --> 03:51:04,398
when we think about what is good

6903
03:51:02,478 --> 03:51:06,799
let's do those things

6904
03:51:04,398 --> 03:51:09,840
that would devastate us

6905
03:51:06,799 --> 03:51:12,478
and a lot of that could be relationships

6906
03:51:09,840 --> 03:51:15,520
and there's a powerful concept from

6907
03:51:12,478 --> 03:51:17,358
um from network theory which is that you

6908
03:51:15,520 --> 03:51:19,439
know the number of connections in a

6909
03:51:17,359 --> 03:51:20,880
network you know i'm just saying foreign

6910
03:51:19,439 --> 03:51:22,720
it grows as the square of the elements

6911
03:51:20,879 --> 03:51:25,119
in the matrix in the number right so you

6912
03:51:22,719 --> 03:51:26,639
think of a matrix with n people you know

6913
03:51:25,120 --> 03:51:28,560
person one two three four and then

6914
03:51:26,639 --> 03:51:30,719
there's four other people there's 16

6915
03:51:28,559 --> 03:51:32,799
different pairs but two half of them

6916
03:51:30,719 --> 03:51:34,559
overlap the diagonal is where you know

6917
03:51:32,799 --> 03:51:36,959
each other you know yourself so there's

6918
03:51:34,559 --> 03:51:38,959
but that still grows as n squared

6919
03:51:36,959 --> 03:51:39,919
so those connections

6920
03:51:38,959 --> 03:51:42,318
increase

6921
03:51:39,920 --> 03:51:43,840
and decrease right you ever have two

6922
03:51:42,318 --> 03:51:45,198
friends that are fighting and like

6923
03:51:43,840 --> 03:51:46,799
you're kind of upset even though you're

6924
03:51:45,199 --> 03:51:48,560
not fighting with either one of them so

6925
03:51:46,799 --> 03:51:50,079
like a network grows like that so you

6926
03:51:48,559 --> 03:51:52,478
want to increase your network as much as

6927
03:51:50,079 --> 03:51:54,799
possible but only the kind of high

6928
03:51:52,478 --> 03:51:57,438
quality interstices between them and i

6929
03:51:54,799 --> 03:51:59,920
think in doing so you incr you you make

6930
03:51:57,439 --> 03:52:01,840
yourself fragile not anti-fragile and i

6931
03:51:59,920 --> 03:52:03,520
think that is where

6932
03:52:01,840 --> 03:52:05,520
purpose and maybe approaching some

6933
03:52:03,520 --> 03:52:08,079
notion of god can come from

6934
03:52:05,520 --> 03:52:11,120
so that is a source of meaning

6935
03:52:08,079 --> 03:52:13,920
maximizing the goodness in life and the

6936
03:52:11,120 --> 03:52:16,399
way you know is good is if it's taken

6937
03:52:13,920 --> 03:52:18,960
away it would devastate you

6938
03:52:16,398 --> 03:52:21,119
that's one way

6939
03:52:18,959 --> 03:52:23,278
think about it your brand your business

6940
03:52:21,120 --> 03:52:25,439
your spouse your kids

6941
03:52:23,279 --> 03:52:26,560
i mean parents can't contact i've known

6942
03:52:25,439 --> 03:52:28,720
parents that have

6943
03:52:26,559 --> 03:52:31,840
jim simons here's a perfect example he's

6944
03:52:28,719 --> 03:52:35,119
one of my oldest friends and mentors

6945
03:52:31,840 --> 03:52:37,199
he is one of the richest people on earth

6946
03:52:35,120 --> 03:52:38,840
gulfstream mega yacht this is all

6947
03:52:37,199 --> 03:52:42,720
documented books about

6948
03:52:38,840 --> 03:52:44,719
um he lost two sons as adults

6949
03:52:42,719 --> 03:52:46,238
and i hear people say i'm so jealous of

6950
03:52:44,719 --> 03:52:48,559
jim simons

6951
03:52:46,238 --> 03:52:50,959
would you take everything

6952
03:52:48,559 --> 03:52:53,198
i don't know where he has that strength

6953
03:52:50,959 --> 03:52:54,799
and his wife marilyn and his first wife

6954
03:52:53,199 --> 03:52:56,800
barbara

6955
03:52:54,799 --> 03:52:59,119
i'm not i'm not like that

6956
03:52:56,799 --> 03:53:00,959
uh some people are there are angels that

6957
03:52:59,120 --> 03:53:02,319
walk among us

6958
03:53:00,959 --> 03:53:03,759
and

6959
03:53:02,318 --> 03:53:06,159
you know i there's this famous prayer

6960
03:53:03,760 --> 03:53:07,600
it's like you know uh god you know

6961
03:53:06,159 --> 03:53:09,199
there's there's an old saying like one

6962
03:53:07,600 --> 03:53:10,720
of the hardest tests there are in life

6963
03:53:09,199 --> 03:53:12,239
is to be given a lot of money and you

6964
03:53:10,719 --> 03:53:13,438
see it like happens with like lawyer

6965
03:53:12,238 --> 03:53:15,680
like people that win the lottery or

6966
03:53:13,439 --> 03:53:17,279
whatever or nfl football players after

6967
03:53:15,680 --> 03:53:19,520
their career's over they get they're

6968
03:53:17,279 --> 03:53:20,640
broke right and i was just like god

6969
03:53:19,520 --> 03:53:22,960
please test me with money you know

6970
03:53:20,639 --> 03:53:24,719
that'd be great but but in reality you

6971
03:53:22,959 --> 03:53:26,799
should never say i'm gonna

6972
03:53:24,719 --> 03:53:28,398
i want what x person has unless you're

6973
03:53:26,799 --> 03:53:31,840
willing to take everything and you'll

6974
03:53:28,398 --> 03:53:31,840
find you won't want to take everything

6975
03:53:32,639 --> 03:53:36,639
yeah

6976
03:53:33,840 --> 03:53:40,079
i think a lot about the altering effects

6977
03:53:36,639 --> 03:53:42,000
of fame of money of power on people

6978
03:53:40,079 --> 03:53:44,000
i

6979
03:53:42,000 --> 03:53:47,120
it uh

6980
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:47,120
it blinds people

6981
03:53:47,439 --> 03:53:51,199
and and i wonder about that

6982
03:53:49,439 --> 03:53:52,720
for myself because

6983
03:53:51,199 --> 03:53:54,560
it seems like

6984
03:53:52,719 --> 03:53:56,159
in themselves these are definitely not

6985
03:53:54,559 --> 03:53:59,680
the goals i'm

6986
03:53:56,159 --> 03:54:01,840
pretty much afraid i'm not desirous

6987
03:53:59,680 --> 03:54:02,960
and i'm definitely afraid of each of

6988
03:54:01,840 --> 03:54:04,639
those things

6989
03:54:02,959 --> 03:54:05,839
money

6990
03:54:04,639 --> 03:54:07,119
fame

6991
03:54:05,840 --> 03:54:09,680
and power

6992
03:54:07,120 --> 03:54:11,760
but it seems the dreams i have

6993
03:54:09,680 --> 03:54:14,079
as consequences

6994
03:54:11,760 --> 03:54:15,920
can often have these things

6995
03:54:14,079 --> 03:54:17,520
and i'm really afraid of becoming

6996
03:54:15,920 --> 03:54:19,760
something

6997
03:54:17,520 --> 03:54:22,319
that would disappoint me when i was

6998
03:54:19,760 --> 03:54:24,000
younger that would um that i wouldn't

6999
03:54:22,318 --> 03:54:25,439
recognize

7000
03:54:24,000 --> 03:54:27,040
you know because change happens

7001
03:54:25,439 --> 03:54:29,439
gradually

7002
03:54:27,040 --> 03:54:31,199
but are you using yourself as the

7003
03:54:29,439 --> 03:54:34,318
as the touchstone to use the assay or

7004
03:54:31,199 --> 03:54:36,560
amount like what is your rubric to to a

7005
03:54:34,318 --> 03:54:38,959
prize if you have lived up to that 12

7006
03:54:36,559 --> 03:54:40,799
year old whatever year old lex like how

7007
03:54:38,959 --> 03:54:42,639
will you know or not know if you've let

7008
03:54:40,799 --> 03:54:44,238
yourself down or

7009
03:54:42,639 --> 03:54:46,398
like i always think live to impress

7010
03:54:44,238 --> 03:54:49,439
yourself like i don't care if i have

7011
03:54:46,398 --> 03:54:51,439
followers like it's nice or whatever but

7012
03:54:49,439 --> 03:54:53,439
it's hedonic and it's just never ending

7013
03:54:51,439 --> 03:54:54,960
because you'll always see the next level

7014
03:54:53,439 --> 03:54:56,398
but i think it's pretty damn cool that

7015
03:54:54,959 --> 03:54:57,759
like i've gotten to go to these places

7016
03:54:56,398 --> 03:54:59,920
the south pole and i've done these

7017
03:54:57,760 --> 03:55:00,719
things and i've made a family and and

7018
03:54:59,920 --> 03:55:02,559
i'm

7019
03:55:00,719 --> 03:55:03,519
able to teleport my values into the

7020
03:55:02,559 --> 03:55:05,840
future

7021
03:55:03,520 --> 03:55:08,159
um through my children and i've had

7022
03:55:05,840 --> 03:55:10,639
ideological children that i

7023
03:55:08,159 --> 03:55:12,478
so by what metric you know have you not

7024
03:55:10,639 --> 03:55:13,680
already a impressed yourself and b could

7025
03:55:12,478 --> 03:55:15,198
you let yourself down i don't in terms

7026
03:55:13,680 --> 03:55:17,920
of the therapist i think some of it is

7027
03:55:15,199 --> 03:55:19,120
psychology for me i'm very much just

7028
03:55:17,920 --> 03:55:21,439
never

7029
03:55:19,120 --> 03:55:23,520
i'm highly self-critical

7030
03:55:21,439 --> 03:55:25,680
i'm never happy never happy with what

7031
03:55:23,520 --> 03:55:28,238
i've done but i'm always happy in the

7032
03:55:25,680 --> 03:55:31,279
way that you describe which is that uh

7033
03:55:28,238 --> 03:55:34,478
the vonnegut thing where you just often

7034
03:55:31,279 --> 03:55:36,159
during the day i will feel i don't know

7035
03:55:34,478 --> 03:55:38,238
i just remember

7036
03:55:36,159 --> 03:55:40,799
just eating uh

7037
03:55:38,238 --> 03:55:43,520
beef jerky and being truly happy that

7038
03:55:40,799 --> 03:55:46,639
was just last night and i have that

7039
03:55:43,520 --> 03:55:47,760
all the time and that to me

7040
03:55:46,639 --> 03:55:48,719
is why

7041
03:55:47,760 --> 03:55:50,478
i mean

7042
03:55:48,719 --> 03:55:53,119
that feels to me like a healthy way to

7043
03:55:50,478 --> 03:55:54,879
live life and at least for me it's the

7044
03:55:53,120 --> 03:55:56,640
one i really enjoy

7045
03:55:54,879 --> 03:55:59,119
a lot of people tell me that maybe being

7046
03:55:56,639 --> 03:56:01,039
so self-critical so hard on yourself

7047
03:55:59,120 --> 03:56:03,120
is not a good way to go but more and

7048
03:56:01,040 --> 03:56:07,120
more as i get older i realize it's just

7049
03:56:03,120 --> 03:56:09,279
who i am i you have to a certain point

7050
03:56:07,120 --> 03:56:10,880
accept this is how i'm always going to

7051
03:56:09,279 --> 03:56:13,600
be this self-critical it's like the

7052
03:56:10,879 --> 03:56:14,719
oracle of delphi right you know thyself

7053
03:56:13,600 --> 03:56:16,238
but i want to leave you with one last

7054
03:56:14,719 --> 03:56:17,438
thing it was just to say just on this

7055
03:56:16,238 --> 03:56:19,840
topic

7056
03:56:17,439 --> 03:56:21,840
you know it could be different right

7057
03:56:19,840 --> 03:56:24,398
we could go down to the ocean and get

7058
03:56:21,840 --> 03:56:26,719
some krill instead of the 7-eleven you

7059
03:56:24,398 --> 03:56:29,198
know it could be that we have no other

7060
03:56:26,719 --> 03:56:31,198
no other taste buds and and you know

7061
03:56:29,199 --> 03:56:33,120
eric's talked to the four dimensions of

7062
03:56:31,199 --> 03:56:34,399
you know the vibration of your tongue

7063
03:56:33,120 --> 03:56:37,199
right it could be

7064
03:56:34,398 --> 03:56:38,398
like there's one and it's just like

7065
03:56:37,199 --> 03:56:40,159
not you know

7066
03:56:38,398 --> 03:56:42,799
memphis barbecue or whatever you like in

7067
03:56:40,159 --> 03:56:44,398
your in your in your slim gym it could

7068
03:56:42,799 --> 03:56:47,119
be something it could be very boring

7069
03:56:44,398 --> 03:56:48,879
similarly what if like that's a clue

7070
03:56:47,120 --> 03:56:50,239
like what if that's giving us evidence

7071
03:56:48,879 --> 03:56:51,920
here's another clue

7072
03:56:50,238 --> 03:56:53,039
we there are many animals most animals

7073
03:56:51,920 --> 03:56:55,840
have single

7074
03:56:53,040 --> 03:56:57,760
mono color vision they only see in in in

7075
03:56:55,840 --> 03:57:00,398
black and white intensity they only have

7076
03:56:57,760 --> 03:57:02,960
rods and no cones

7077
03:57:00,398 --> 03:57:05,519
we could be like that but we're not

7078
03:57:02,959 --> 03:57:06,719
why is that not a clue like

7079
03:57:05,520 --> 03:57:08,159
if like

7080
03:57:06,719 --> 03:57:08,959
god's not gonna like hit you over the

7081
03:57:08,159 --> 03:57:10,318
head

7082
03:57:08,959 --> 03:57:11,358
and say like here i am because then

7083
03:57:10,318 --> 03:57:12,719
everybody would believe in him and

7084
03:57:11,359 --> 03:57:14,318
there's very simplistic i've had debates

7085
03:57:12,719 --> 03:57:16,478
even with like famous atheists like

7086
03:57:14,318 --> 03:57:18,398
lawrence krauss he's like self-declared

7087
03:57:16,478 --> 03:57:20,238
militant atheist

7088
03:57:18,398 --> 03:57:22,398
and i was like well i don't believe in

7089
03:57:20,238 --> 03:57:24,079
the same god you don't believe in like

7090
03:57:22,398 --> 03:57:26,079
some guy in a white beard and a chair

7091
03:57:24,079 --> 03:57:27,840
like that's infantile like i gave that

7092
03:57:26,079 --> 03:57:30,159
away a long time ago

7093
03:57:27,840 --> 03:57:31,439
but what if there are clues what if yang

7094
03:57:30,159 --> 03:57:33,199
mills theory and

7095
03:57:31,439 --> 03:57:34,800
you know maxwell's equate like what

7096
03:57:33,199 --> 03:57:37,040
those are beautiful

7097
03:57:34,799 --> 03:57:39,119
if you've ever seen like you know

7098
03:57:37,040 --> 03:57:41,520
expressed in tensor notation einstein's

7099
03:57:39,120 --> 03:57:43,840
equations or or maxwell's equations or

7100
03:57:41,520 --> 03:57:46,159
and then maxwell's equations riding on

7101
03:57:43,840 --> 03:57:47,520
uh einstein's it's unbelievably

7102
03:57:46,159 --> 03:57:49,199
beautiful

7103
03:57:47,520 --> 03:57:51,199
doesn't have to be that way

7104
03:57:49,199 --> 03:57:53,120
that we can comprehend it

7105
03:57:51,199 --> 03:57:55,279
that's a crack maybe that's where the

7106
03:57:53,120 --> 03:57:58,000
light gets in and the light is what

7107
03:57:55,279 --> 03:57:59,920
reveals what's beautiful so i i don't

7108
03:57:58,000 --> 03:58:02,079
believe in god i think that's a stupid

7109
03:57:59,920 --> 03:58:04,079
notion like do i believe in god like

7110
03:58:02,079 --> 03:58:05,840
sometimes i i wonder if god believes in

7111
03:58:04,079 --> 03:58:08,000
me you know like more than if i believe

7112
03:58:05,840 --> 03:58:10,478
it like he needs brian keating like you

7113
03:58:08,000 --> 03:58:12,398
know what you know it's like one of my

7114
03:58:10,478 --> 03:58:14,719
friends is a rabbit he's like um

7115
03:58:12,398 --> 03:58:16,238
what would i be doing if i were god

7116
03:58:14,719 --> 03:58:17,920
exactly what god's doing right now like

7117
03:58:16,238 --> 03:58:21,680
you think i know more than god give me a

7118
03:58:17,920 --> 03:58:24,079
prayer leaving cue clues of beauty for

7119
03:58:21,680 --> 03:58:26,159
for these hairless apes yeah

7120
03:58:24,079 --> 03:58:29,199
and to see what they do with this and

7121
03:58:26,159 --> 03:58:32,398
then marvel at um

7122
03:58:29,199 --> 03:58:35,199
at the both the tragedy of what the what

7123
03:58:32,398 --> 03:58:36,318
those apes do to each other and

7124
03:58:35,199 --> 03:58:39,359
the

7125
03:58:36,318 --> 03:58:41,439
the rare moments of uh when they have

7126
03:58:39,359 --> 03:58:43,279
when they understand understand deeply
