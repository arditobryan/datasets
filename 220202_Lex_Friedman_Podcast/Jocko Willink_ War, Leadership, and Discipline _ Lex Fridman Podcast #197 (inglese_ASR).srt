00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,879
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,440
jaco willink a retired u.s navy seal

3
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,320
co-author of extreme ownership dichotomy

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,638
of leadership

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,839
discipline equals freedom and many other

6
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,039
excellent books

7
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:17,439
and he's the host of jaco podcast

8
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:18,480
jacob spent 20 years in the seal teams

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,520
he was the commander

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,439
of seal team 3's task unit bruiser

11
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,960
that became the most highly decorated

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,079
special operations unit

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,960
of the iraq war this conversation was

14
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,678
intense

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,280
and to the point we agreed to talk again

16
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,079
probably many times

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,960
and what i find very interesting aside

18
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,200
from the talk

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,640
of leadership is the conversation about

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,440
military tactics

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,120
of specific battles in history quick

22
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:48,558
mention of our sponsors

23
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:50,718

the united states

28
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:59,599
let me say a few words about what this

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,160
country

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,760
my country the united states of america

31
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,000
means to me

32
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,759
first by way of background i was born

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,280
and raised in the soviet union

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
just long enough to get a bit of the

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,560
russian soul an appreciation of soviet

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,880
history

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,920
music culture of wrestling and

38
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,719
mathematics

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,680
of engineering and philosophy stoicism

40
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,519
and humor

41
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
tragedies and triumphs of war and

42
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,759
revolutions

43
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,000
all in ways that are uniquely russian i

44
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,319
do

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,359
happen to at times mention that i'm

46
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,758
russian

47
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,560
this is what i mean that i got a bit of

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,519
that

49
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
russian soul but of course who i really

50
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,478
am

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,438
is an american this country gave me the

52
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,319
opportunity

53
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,118
the freedom to become and to be who i am

54
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,758
to stand

55
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,920
as an individual this seemingly simple

56
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,879
freedom to be a sovereign human being in

57
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,040
the face of

58
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,879
all the beauty and cruelty of life is

59
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,079
why i love this country

60
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:57,199
much of life can be unfair unjust even

61
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,199
tragic

62
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,240
but this is the country where if i'm

63
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,399
clever enough

64
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,478
work hard enough and just get lucky

65
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,200
enough i have a chance to dream big

66
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,639
and make my dream a reality the united

67
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,800
states welcomed me

68
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,000
my family and millions of immigrants

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,760
throughout its history

70
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
so that we can make something meaningful

71
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:19,280
of ourselves to love to dream to create

72
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,719
to find joy and meaning it lets me be

73
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
the weird kid i am

74
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:24,400
who wears a suit talks about love and

75
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,039
has a

76
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
fascination with robots i know some

77
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:29,840
people these days

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,039
have an aversion to pride and love for

79
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,319
their country

80
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,439
i don't i love america i also love

81
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,719
humanity

82
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:41,598
i believe these two patriotism and

83
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:43,199
humanism are not in conflict much like

84
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,119
loving your family and loving your

85
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:47,039
country are not in conflict

86
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,120
they are all manifestations of the human

87
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,159
spirit longing to strive

88
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,120
for a better world i was born a russian

89
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,560
but i believe i'll die an american a

90
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,519
proud american

91
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,120
hopefully not too soon but uh life is

92
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,760
short i already had one hell of a fun

93
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,719
journey

94
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,878
so i'm ready to go when it's time this

95
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,719
is the lex friedman podcast and here

96
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:13,120
is my conversation with jocko willink

97
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:14,560
is it tragic or beautiful to you that

98
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,519
some of the closest bonds that are

99
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,280
formed

100
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,080
between people are through war often

101
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,878
i think it's both both tragic and

102
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,519
beautiful

103
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:27,518
and for the obvious reasons

104
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,840
what are the obvious reasons why is it

105
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
so obvious

106
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:38,479
well it's tragic because a lot of people

107
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,239
die

108
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,479
and it's beautiful because you form

109
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,560
bonds with people that

110
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:50,479
are very difficult to break once you've

111
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,759
been through them what is it about

112
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:55,919
the trauma of war that makes bonds

113
00:03:53,759 --> 00:03:58,239
difficult to break

114
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,759
because what you realize when you're in

115
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,840
the war

116
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:05,840
is that the people that are next to you

117
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
you rely on them and they're relying on

118
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,959
you to survive

119
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,719
and without them you will not survive

120
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,878
and when you realize that you need to

121
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:18,319
work together as a team

122
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:20,478
to to live

123
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,319
that forms a very strong bond and

124
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:25,519
there's nothing like that team

125
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:28,079
outside of the realm of war

126
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,519
i don't know because i've there's a lot

127
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,478
of things that i haven't experienced in

128
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,839
my life

129
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,879
but i think the pressure and the

130
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,319
consequences

131
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:41,519
of war there could be similar situations

132
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:42,319
in survival scenarios in various

133
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,839
atrocities

134
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,599
where people need to work together

135
00:04:45,839 --> 00:04:51,279
in order to survive and i think you

136
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,280
could probably get something that was

137
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,680
similar there's a very particular nature

138
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:58,159
to the kind of war that world war

139
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,360
ii was especially for the soviet union

140
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,560
where it didn't just

141
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,120
influence the lives of people it created

142
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,918
culture

143
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,639
the music the poetry the literature it's

144
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,799
it's in the

145
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:12,400
um it's in the way people think

146
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,240
it's in the way people see the world

147
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:15,758
it's in the way they talk even still to

148
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,400
this day

149
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,400
and um

150
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,840
of course i was talking about the

151
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,038
directly relationship between two

152
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,038
soldiers

153
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,478
but there's something about the depth of

154
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,519
human connection

155
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:35,279
that results from those almost like uh

156
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,399
reverberations of war like generations

157
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,279
later you're still

158
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:41,120
close to other humans you're you're

159
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,439
there's a coldness towards other humans

160
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,720
like

161
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:48,959
in russia but once you open

162
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,479
up its depth you seek depth

163
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:55,279
of connection versus like breadth of

164
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,560
career kind of thinking how can i make

165
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,079
friends with this so i can move into

166
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,199
this direction what can this person

167
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,599
benefit me you

168
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,360
instead you seek a depth of human

169
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,400
connection and appreciation that that

170
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,919
brings a lot

171
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:11,038
and maybe i'm romanticizing war here

172
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:12,719
but it feels like that's inextricably

173
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:14,800
connected to world war ii

174
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,840
for russians is this does that resonate

175
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,680
at all is it

176
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:21,439
so if you look at military training

177
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,519
what they do is they take people in the

178
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:24,719
military from the civilian world they

179
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:26,159
bring them into the military and they

180
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:29,440
put them through

181
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,960
boot camp which is the stereotypical

182
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:32,000
thing that you see on tv you're going to

183
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,680
get yelled at you're going to get

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,038
screamed out you're going to get

185
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,280
you're gonna get put in the mud and

186
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,800
you're gonna made to be made to do hard

187
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,399
things together

188
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,360
and what does that do with those

189
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,000
civilians well it gives them a common

190
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,520
background

191
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,360
it gives them a common suffering that

192
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,719
they've been through together

193
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,879
and they form some sort of connection

194
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,720
some sort of bond

195
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,159
now to make that bond a little bit

196
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,599
stronger

197
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,039
after you get done with boot camp they

198
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:06,079
send you to advanced infantry school

199
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:08,399
and you suffer some more together

200
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:09,680
and when you suffer more together now

201
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:10,239
you're in a smaller group too because

202
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,319
now it's

203
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,840
infantry it's not supply people anymore

204
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,598
or logisticians it's

205
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,198
strictly people that are going to

206
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,560
fight their infantrymen so they go

207
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,639
through a school together and now they

208
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,759
get a little bit tighter

209
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,120
get done with that and maybe you go to

210
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,120
an airborne division so you go to

211
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,639
airborne school and now you all

212
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,560
overcome this fear of jumping out of an

213
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,439
airplane together and you celebrate

214
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,439
surviving that

215
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:38,478
then maybe you get done with that and

216
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,918
now you go at an airborne division now

217
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:40,240
you're an even tighter group because

218
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,120
you've

219
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,879
suffered together what comes next is

220
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,319
special forces training or ranger

221
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
training and what they do is they put

222
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,080
you in these situations where

223
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,359
you're going to suffer together and

224
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:52,800
you're going to build these bonds

225
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
because as i said earlier you have to

226
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,639
rely on each other to survive

227
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,680
and by the way not everyone does not

228
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,120
everyone makes it through this training

229
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,720
so you sort of have these memories of

230
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,840
people that didn't make it you

231
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,440
share that connection as well and you

232
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:06,799
can keep going down this road until you

233
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,199
go into combat

234
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,038
with a military unit and military units

235
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,038
that go through combat

236
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,399
have an even tighter bond and the harder

237
00:08:13,038 --> 00:08:16,560
the combat that they go through the

238
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:19,198
tighter the bond is going to be

239
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,360
so i think when you talk about what the

240
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,160
soviet union went through in world war

241
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,960
ii

242
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:31,039
there was a shared suffering

243
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:33,199
to survive and so the entire nation

244
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,799
has that common thread and that's

245
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,399
probably the thing that you

246
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:41,679
sense or feel when you refer back to

247
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,479
the bond that resonates all the way back

248
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,679
to

249
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,480
world war two so in your podcast in your

250
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,919
writing

251
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,000
you talk about some of the most

252
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,519
fascinating things i listen to you

253
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,200
talk about in terms of military conflict

254
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,240
is uh tactics and sort of the details

255
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,240
of of combat

256
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,719
but allow me to stick on world war two

257
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,120
for a second

258
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,040
there's a particular aspect to that war

259
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,480
i don't know if you can speak to it

260
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:17,519
where twice the number of civilians died

261
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:21,039
in military personnel

262
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:24,480
so the soviet union especially

263
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:27,439
um you know my uh

264
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,920
my grandfather was a machine gunner on

265
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,600
uh

266
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,439
the in um ukraine as the

267
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,639
germans were marching towards moscow

268
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,120
there's this main there's

269
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,879
this important push in 1941 where they

270
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,240
were trying to get before the winter to

271
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,039
uh to moscow

272
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,919
and what stalin was doing is he was

273
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:49,519
basically throwing bodies

274
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,199
at at uh to slow the attack

275
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,560
and what that meant is everybody

276
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,120
understood that you

277
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,079
your job was you have this heavy machine

278
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,959
guns

279
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,720
it's very it's almost unreasonable to be

280
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,199
able to be mobile any kind of way with

281
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,519
them

282
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,720
so you're you're throwing at the front

283
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,039
and you're just non-stop

284
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,800
shooting and you know 95 plus percent of

285
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,799
people are just dead

286
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,078
other soldiers are just dead and then

287
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:16,240
you just go back

288
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:17,679
back and you're trying to protect as

289
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
many civilians as you can throughout

290
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:21,838
this whole process but you don't

291
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,800
and so you have millions of civilians

292
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,240
that die along the way into this march

293
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:28,879
is there something you can say about

294
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,120
this complete perhaps it's naive for me

295
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:34,320
to say but

296
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:37,839
a war that lacks tactics

297
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:42,160
that lacks strategy

298
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,160
and is purely about just

299
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,240
no consideration of human life and just

300
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:54,078
throwing bodies

301
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,759
and bullets into a mix together where

302
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,838
millions die

303
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,078
and that in particular felt much less

304
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,079
like

305
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:07,919
conflict and much more like

306
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:07,919
torture or suffering

307
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,319
it didn't it didn't come off as torture

308
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,159
only that

309
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,560
interestingly enough as you probably

310
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,240
know my grandfather including everybody

311
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,599
else

312
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,480
volunteered they were proud to do this

313
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,000
they were proud to march to their death

314
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,639
for country for love of country

315
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,039
but the question on the civilian side

316
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,120
when

317
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:36,399
when more civilians die the military

318
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,399
personnel what do you make of that

319
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,920
it's awful and it's awful when

320
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,120
a soldier dies it's awful when a

321
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:46,078
civilian dies

322
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,440
it's awful when 10 civilians or 10

323
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:49,519
soldiers and it's

324
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:53,600
even more awful when millions and

325
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,600
millions of soldiers and civilians die

326
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:59,439
i think it's safe to say that the soviet

327
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:03,278
union was facing an existential threat

328
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,320
to their existence against the nazis

329
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:10,078
so to not fight

330
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,920
would be to die as well maybe die a

331
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,599
death a few years later

332
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:15,599
maybe die a different way but

333
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,278
the choice was die now trying

334
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:26,159
or die later on your knees

335
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,519
and i think the choice was pretty clear

336
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,559
as far as the

337
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,480
tactics go i mean there is

338
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:34,000
this is attrition warfare that's what

339
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,639
that is we are going to

340
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,519
keep you know you said throwing bodies

341
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,079
at the problem

342
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,799
that's attrition warfare and the soviet

343
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:44,319
union had

344
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:45,519
a lot of bodies more than the germans

345
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,519
and when you fight with attrition

346
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,039
warfare whoever has more men and

347
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,560
material will eventually win

348
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:56,799
it's an awful it's an awful way

349
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:59,919
but that's the that's that's what the

350
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:02,479
strategy was you often talk about

351
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:02,479
leadership

352
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:10,638
let's put the evils of hitler aside

353
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:13,120
the boldness of hitler in making some of

354
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,799
the strategic decisions he did

355
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,879
was considered by many military

356
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:21,120
historians quite brilliant

357
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:24,240
early in the war are insane

358
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,919
and brilliant stalin on the other hand i

359
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,720
think universally is seen as somebody

360
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:29,759
who is

361
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,040
terrible military strategist especially

362
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,078
early in the war

363
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,919
he did not see all the possible

364
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,439
trajectories that the war could take

365
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:38,958
is there something you could say about

366
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,320
failure of leadership

367
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:45,039
stalin also the united kingdom

368
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,839
before churchill and also fdr on the

369
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,719
united states side

370
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,639
who basically

371
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,079
was trying to turn a blind eye to

372
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,759
everything that was happening over

373
00:13:54,078 --> 00:14:00,239
over there with a perspective of

374
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:02,319
we just want to make we want to keep

375
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,560
america's interests

376
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,399
uh as the primary interest and

377
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,679
everything else let other countries work

378
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,958
out their problems

379
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,559
you know i think one of the things with

380
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,518
hitler was in the beginning of the war

381
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,838
he listened to

382
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,078
his advisors he listened to his generals

383
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,680
and

384
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:19,198
therefore they did pretty well with that

385
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,559
i think as the war went on

386
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:23,359
he believed that he was smarter than he

387
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,479
was

388
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:30,159
and made decisions that were bad

389
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:31,920
that cost him dearly

390
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,078
you know i mean case in point as

391
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:35,039
everyone knows going and attacking the

392
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:36,399
soviet union

393
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,799
while you're still fighting a war on the

394
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,159
other front is not not a good move

395
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,159
there's an example of yeah bad

396
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:42,639
leadership letting your ego get in the

397
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:44,000
way

398
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,600
believing that you can do things that

399
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,519
you that are beyond your capabilities

400
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,399
but you know as you mentioned in the

401
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,959
beginning with blitzkrieg

402
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,039
those were really dynamic and bold moves

403
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,119
and they worked

404
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:01,759
and that what does that do that fuels

405
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,799
your ego and makes you think that

406
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:05,198
you can win many people consider that

407
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,919
war

408
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:07,919
a just war

409
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,560
what do you think makes it just war

410
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:15,919
i think you have the nazis and the

411
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:18,399
imperial japanese

412
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,838
trying to impose their will on other

413
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,958
nations and other peoples

414
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,600
and when that happens i think on a grand

415
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,679
scale

416
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,278
people look at that and

417
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:31,198
believe it's just to step in and do

418
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,559
something about it

419
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:37,838
is there some gray area here there's

420
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,439
there's nothing but gray area

421
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,079
the united states has been involved in a

422
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:44,000
lot of military conflicts since then

423
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:45,679
how do you draw the line to the grey

424
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
area

425
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,120
what what war should we engage in and

426
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,759
not

427
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,639
i know you don't get into politics much

428
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,440
but

429
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,720
what the decision to go to war you have

430
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,160
to look at the situation that you're

431
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,639
going into and you have to make sure

432
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,759
that you have

433
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:06,720
the will to go to war and

434
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:09,199
the will to go to war means that you are

435
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,959
willing to kill people

436
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,479
and when i say people i don't just mean

437
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,479
enemy because in war

438
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,079
civilians are going to die women and

439
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,000
children are going to die

440
00:16:16,078 --> 00:16:19,838
every a lot of people are going to die

441
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,720
and so you and you are going to kill

442
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,160
them

443
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,240
it doesn't matter what kind of smart

444
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,838
munitions you have doesn't matter how

445
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,879
disciplined your soldiers are

446
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,880
when you go into a war civilians are

447
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:31,600
going to die and you have to understand

448
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,639
that

449
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,079
and the other thing that you have to

450
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:40,879
understand is that

451
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:40,879
your troops are also going to die

452
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,319
and it seems like sometimes we're a

453
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,879
little bit naive about the calculation

454
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,519
of what that's going to look like

455
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,519
and maybe we think well not that many

456
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,600
civilians and maybe not that many of our

457
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:54,959
our personnel are going to die and

458
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,000
that's where you get into

459
00:16:54,958 --> 00:17:00,239
sticky situations and you know another

460
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,278
thing when you were talking about

461
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:05,919
the soviet union versus the nazis

462
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,599
that's total war that's what that is and

463
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,400
we don't engage in that very often it's

464
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,279
total war

465
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,240
it's we will do absolutely anything to

466
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,480
win

467
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,359
and america doesn't fight like that very

468
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,959
often

469
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,279
in fact the last time we fought like

470
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,600
that was world war ii

471
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,639
we it was total war we will do whatever

472
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,838
it takes

473
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,360
to up to and including the atomic bomb

474
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:30,639
to destroy the enemy so

475
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,119
those are the kind of things you need to

476
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,720
think about before you go to war

477
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,639
and i don't think we think about that

478
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,558
very often

479
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,080
you know even the united states the

480
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:41,918
atomic bomb

481
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:46,399
nuclear weapons is an interesting one

482
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:48,880
because there's a lot of

483
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,160
there's a lot of hesitation on that

484
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,960
there's a lot of critics of that

485
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,720
decision as it was happening

486
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,319
so even america you can imagine other

487
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,120
countries like germany would not be so

488
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,439
hesitant

489
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:04,719
to use nuclear weapons

490
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,720
it's interesting to think about

491
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,959
in deciding military strategy to inject

492
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,160
ethics into it

493
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,360
into morality it's not just about

494
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,679
winning the war but

495
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:21,038
should we do this and doing the

496
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,038
calculation of human life

497
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,720
usually those decisions are made by

498
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:28,319
leaders

499
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,798
not by the the soldier that's going to

500
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,000
be implementing

501
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:35,359
that the the that decision do you put

502
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,880
some responsibility

503
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,879
i should even say blame on the leaders

504
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,480
and not doing that kind of calculation

505
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,000
here you could say that

506
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,079
you could say about the vietnam war you

507
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,400
could say that about even the war that

508
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:50,720
you're involved with in iraq

509
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,320
is there some criticism here that you

510
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,319
could apply to leaders

511
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:57,119
for failing not to consider the broader

512
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:59,439
moral questions

513
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,439
yes

514
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,599
natural like all leaders will make these

515
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:08,839
mistakes

516
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,719
or should leaders not make these

517
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:12,798
mistakes

518
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,759
leaders are going to make mistakes it's

519
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:14,558
impossible to know what's going to

520
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,759
happen in war

521
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,678
just like it's impossible to know what's

522
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,960
going to happen in life you make that

523
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:22,559
you make decisions based on the

524
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,558
information that you have at the time

525
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,480
and you will make mistakes and if you

526
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,720
fail to

527
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:31,599
admit that you made a mistake that's

528
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,720
where i have a more significant problem

529
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,719
than someone that makes a mistake and

530
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,798
says hey this is the mistake that i made

531
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,480
this is the intelligence that i thought

532
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,879
we were utilizing

533
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,000
and it actually is not what i thought it

534
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,440
was going to be

535
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,119
and here's the new direction that we're

536
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,240
going in

537
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:53,759
we don't have enough of that

538
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:57,359
type of ownership in

539
00:19:53,759 --> 00:20:00,879
in leadership globally

540
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,879
just saying i made a mistake

541
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,279
that resulted in the loss at scale of

542
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,519
human life

543
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,879
being able to say that and when you

544
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,079
don't say that

545
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,840
you end up with a more loss of human

546
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,439
life

547
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,678
can i ask you about the loss of human

548
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,679
life

549
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,240
how does killing a human being change

550
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:22,240
you

551
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,679
what does it mean to kill a human being

552
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,000
what does it feel like to kill a human

553
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,000
being

554
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,720
well i mean i guess you'd have to look

555
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,559
at what circumstances a person's in

556
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,798
when this is taking place if you've got

557
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:45,119
someone that's in a

558
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:46,400
fit of rage that goes and kills somebody

559
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,000
you know they're going to come out of it

560
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:54,798
and think wow i just really messed up

561
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:57,359
if you've got a someone that is a

562
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,119
sociopath right they're not going to

563
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,959
feel anything and

564
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:03,279
that person deserved to die and that's

565
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,319
why they died if you've got a

566
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:09,119
soldier who feels like they're trying to

567
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:09,119
protect their friends

568
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,960
they'll move through that if you've got

569
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,798
a soldier that's doing it because they

570
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,079
want some kind of

571
00:21:16,798 --> 00:21:22,639
personal glory they'll probably not feel

572
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,319
good about it later

573
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,840
so i think it depends on the situation i

574
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:28,879
think it depends on the psychology of

575
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:33,199
the individual that's going through it

576
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,200
he said move through that

577
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:39,119
is there some calculation here that a

578
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,240
soldier

579
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,678
when they kill another soldier a

580
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,798
realization that is

581
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,759
just another human being i mean is there

582
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,279
some

583
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,279
heavy burden to that aspect

584
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,159
that it's ultimately just human on human

585
00:21:57,279 --> 00:22:02,158
i think it depends a lot on the scenario

586
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,440
i know that when i was in iraq fighting

587
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,600
you we we talk a lot about the

588
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,679
dehumanization

589
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:11,678
of the enemy and it's something that the

590
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,080
governments will do i mean governments

591
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,640
and will do that to each other i mean

592
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:16,720
the

593
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,159
the japanese dehumanized the americans

594
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
and the americans dehumanized the

595
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:22,480
japanese

596
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,558
and the americans dehumanized the nazis

597
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,038
and the nazis dehumanized the americans

598
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,839
so that to remove as much of that human

599
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:32,079
on human

600
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:35,119
killing aspect that you're talking about

601
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:38,399
and what i what i've said is that

602
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,239
in when we were in iraq we didn't have

603
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,360
to dehumanize the enemy because the

604
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,839
the enemy dehumanized themselves through

605
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:46,719
their actions through their behaviors

606
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:49,359
when when

607
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,400
we know that they are torturing and

608
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:54,798
raping

609
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:57,919
and murdering the local populace

610
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,240
they've been dehumanized and so as far

611
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,000
as

612
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,960
looking at them and thinking oh this is

613
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,960
a you know a human another human that's

614
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:10,240
that's on the level of you know my

615
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:11,759
my uncle or my brother

616
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,359
i did i didn't think of them out that

617
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,359
way i thought of them as

618
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,839
as murdering raping

619
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:23,839
evil

620
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,440
sub-humans yeah iraq is different

621
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,279
and america's position is different

622
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,880
you're right that america has not been

623
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:38,079
involved in a war where it's quite like

624
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,080
two humans fighting like teenage boys

625
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,240
fighting against each other

626
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,359
and you've got to remember i mean we're

627
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,640
we're seeing

628
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,119
these iraqi kids that are living under

629
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,600
this

630
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:54,639
sadistic sadistic terror

631
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:58,399
the iraqi women that are being

632
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:01,440
raped and abused by these insurgents

633
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,559
and so on the one side we become

634
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:07,038
the the iraqi populace is very

635
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:08,639
humanized to us because we're talking to

636
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:10,720
them we've got interpreters

637
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,720
we understand we're seeing them day

638
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,919
after day the same individuals

639
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,440
and so we form a bond with the local

640
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,919
populace

641
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,720
and yet we see what the insurgents are

642
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,840
doing

643
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,319
and so it's again not difficult

644
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:28,399
to dehumanize people that behave in that

645
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,278
manner

646
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,400
yeah i suppose i'm i worry about the

647
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:35,919
dehumanization at a much larger scale

648
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,759
when it's not the kind of case that

649
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,759
you're talking about even now

650
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,240
hopefully i'm not fear-mongering but

651
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,839
there's a sense in which there's the

652
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:54,240
drums of war slowly starting to build

653
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,240
with china there

654
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:01,038
in the best case it would be a cold war

655
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,679
of there's a dehumanization aspect

656
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:06,480
that's happening with china currently

657
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,320
which is they're the other and they're

658
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,240
after stealing all of your data there's

659
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:11,519
a cyber security it starts with cyber

660
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,798
security and it

661
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,319
it worries me because it creates the

662
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,839
other out of

663
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:23,599
a very large population

664
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:25,678
that that may ultimately lead to

665
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,158
conflict

666
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,440
in the worst case hot conflict that

667
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,080
would no longer be

668
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,278
the situation you are in in iraq and

669
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:36,158
more

670
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,038
similar to the soviet union conflict

671
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,960
with the

672
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:44,240
with germany that its kids

673
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:46,960
and then they're dehumanized to where

674
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,640
you're at scale slaughtering them or at

675
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,558
least

676
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,080
hurting their quality of life in a way

677
00:25:50,558 --> 00:25:54,480
that's uh maybe

678
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,399
you know suffering has many forms it

679
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,480
doesn't have to be through just a hot

680
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,600
war it could be um

681
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:03,278
through starvation through camps

682
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:04,798
all those kinds of things and i worry i

683
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:06,640
worry about that

684
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,480
we kind of tend to think that these wars

685
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:10,240
are behind us

686
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,159
and i'm not always so sure that's the

687
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,720
case

688
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:17,278
and at least in the way that uh it

689
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,079
ultimately starts with hate

690
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:21,278
and if again hopefully i'm not being too

691
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,678
dramatic

692
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,400
but i i see that there's a kind of

693
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,679
brewing

694
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,880
of uh it starts with dehumanization and

695
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:31,278
turns to hate

696
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,240
of the other you see that with china you

697
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:37,038
see it a little bit with russia

698
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,000
and uh you have an early podcast between

699
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:39,919
the the

700
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,679
where you break down the tactics of the

701
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,200
chechen war versus russia it's

702
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,720
fascinating

703
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,319
but that's the kind of conflicts i'm

704
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,319
referring to and um

705
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,079
i don't know um there's a i know you're

706
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:56,720
a bit of a musician uh

707
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,158
i love uh i love dad straight song

708
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,000
called brothers in arms i don't know if

709
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:03,039
you know that one

710
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:05,440
and there's a line in it i think they

711
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:07,278
they play it uh quite often in military

712
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,679
funerals which i just recently learned

713
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:09,919
but

714
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,720
it's this powerful song as a line um

715
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:14,320
we're fools

716
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,519
to make war on our brothers in arms

717
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:19,200
do you think there's some sense in which

718
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,960
at the leadership level but just as

719
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,759
human beings

720
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:28,880
were perhaps foolish and engaging

721
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,879
in military conflict

722
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:32,319
as much as we have

723
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,120
or is full a very inappropriate word

724
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,919
here

725
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,879
well i think the using the term brothers

726
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,200
in arms means

727
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,880
the people that are on my side right so

728
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,919
it doesn't make sense

729
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,880
to start wars with people that are on

730
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,360
your side

731
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,120
so that's that might just be the way the

732
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,678
lyrics are written so that it

733
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:57,519
fit the song or whatever um i think

734
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,640
broadly what you're asking me is

735
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:02,960
is war foolish yeah

736
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,399
and i would say the answer is yes and if

737
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:10,319
you can avoid it you absolutely should

738
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:13,439
but if there is a

739
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:16,240
bear or a wolf that is trying to get

740
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,480
into your house

741
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,759
is it foolish to shoot that bear or

742
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,480
shoot that wolf

743
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,359
i think the answer is pretty obvious so

744
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,200
when

745
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,719
you're you're threatened or your family

746
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,519
are threatened or your way of life is

747
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,120
threatened

748
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:33,440
then you have to do something to

749
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:34,558
try and defend your family your way of

750
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,440
life

751
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:39,359
it should be the last resort should be

752
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,798
the last resort

753
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:42,798
you had a conversation with jordan

754
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:48,959
peterson

755
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,959
where he asked you a question

756
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,960
in terms of war being last resort

757
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:55,919
whether you would like your kids to grow

758
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,600
up

759
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:03,360
in peace in a time of no war

760
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:05,278
you said yes but and so happens jordan

761
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,678
didn't let you finish

762
00:29:05,278 --> 00:29:10,240
can you um can you elaborate what

763
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,919
follows the butt

764
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,519
well you you and i have been talking

765
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,559
about the fact that struggle

766
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,679
brings people together and and brings

767
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,038
out the best and

768
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,720
and the worst brings out the worst in

769
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:24,319
people war brings out the worst people

770
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,319
it also brings out the best in people

771
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:31,038
so would you want your kid

772
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,159
to go and enter in a wrestling

773
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:35,599
tournament

774
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:41,278
where you paid all the

775
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:43,278
other kids off and your kid won

776
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,720
or you enter them in a jiu jitsu

777
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,599
tournament where

778
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,480
they're a purple belt and you know that

779
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,759
everyone that they're going to fight

780
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,759
against is a white belt

781
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:53,519
and so they get the they get the big w

782
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:56,640
they get the win

783
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:58,639
but they don't really get tested and

784
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,080
they don't really struggle and if you

785
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,480
don't struggle you don't grow

786
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:04,480
so that's the but right

787
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:10,960
the the absolute best

788
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:14,639
times of my life

789
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,600
were in combat and the worst times of my

790
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,720
life

791
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,480
were in combat and so even though i

792
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,679
wouldn't want any of my children to

793
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,159
suffer through the worst of times

794
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,038
at the same time the bud is i would want

795
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,080
them to

796
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,200
have the opportunity to feel that bond

797
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,558
that you're referring to

798
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,200
earlier and to see human beings

799
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:40,079
that are willing to sacrifice their

800
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,200
lives for their friends

801
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,480
you mentioned the worst what are some of

802
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,038
the worst aspects

803
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,839
of when you were in iraq what are the

804
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:55,200
things that um

805
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:58,240
the hardest on you

806
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,240
have my guys killed

807
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:06,879
is there uh absurd cruelty to it

808
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:10,240
was it due to mistakes or natural

809
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:12,320
consequences of fighting

810
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,798
is there any difference is that at the

811
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,278
end is just losing those or

812
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,119
brothers in arms there's a million

813
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,798
different ways to get killed in the war

814
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,158
and you can go out in an operation and

815
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,519
you can do everything

816
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,880
wrong and you can survive and you can go

817
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,079
out in an operation and do everything

818
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,080
perfect and you can get killed

819
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:35,039
is there some aspect which makes it

820
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,038
worse when there's mistakes made

821
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:38,720
well yeah if there's mistakes made then

822
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:41,200
you're gonna sit there and

823
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,600
beat yourself up eternally for mistakes

824
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,480
that were made

825
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,599
but to you the things that hurt is just

826
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,159
losing

827
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:57,278
losing people close to you yes

828
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,278
are you yourself afraid of death no

829
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,240
do you think about it does it make sense

830
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:05,840
to you that this thing

831
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:08,798
ends like do you uh the stoics

832
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,959
contemplate a death it gives flavor to

833
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:12,558
life it makes you appreciate

834
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,079
there's something about finiteness of

835
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:17,918
life that makes it

836
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,918
that makes it this uh

837
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,398
jocko discipline go drink sour apple

838
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:24,639
that i'm enjoying

839
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,278
it's delicious makes it taste better

840
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,278
because i'm going to die one day

841
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,839
and i think about that a lot do you

842
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:31,839
think about it

843
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,240
other than i know that it's gonna end

844
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,639
i mean but i don't think about it on a

845
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,120
daily basis i think about just the fact

846
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,919
i think about i know that i'm lucky to

847
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,038
be here

848
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,399
i know that many people sacrificed to

849
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:51,759
give me this opportunity

850
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:56,798
to be here so

851
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:58,480
but i don't dwell on it

852
00:32:56,798 --> 00:32:59,918
what about when you were in combat

853
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,159
nothing

854
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,000
there's there's tactics there's strategy

855
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:07,840
there's the mission

856
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,640
and then your immortality

857
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,000
is not part of the calculation i think

858
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,278
you get to a point where you

859
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,119
accept the fact that you can die

860
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,558
like i i you know like i said you can do

861
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,000
everything right you roll out the gate

862
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,398
you hit an ied

863
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,200
a triple stack subsurface ied and you're

864
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:24,639
dead you're done

865
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,798
and there's nothing that's going to stop

866
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,799
that it's going to happen and

867
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,000
i think if you're scared of that or

868
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,679
you're thinking about that

869
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,519
it's going to inhibit your ability to do

870
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:35,120
your job properly

871
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,839
and i think it's also going to drive you

872
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,678
crazy the thing that i thought about

873
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,720
more was that happening to

874
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,480
my guys and that's the gut-wrenching

875
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,960
terror that you feel

876
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,960
when when operations happen

877
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,240
can i ask you about love of country is

878
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,200
it's uh

879
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,200
it continues to

880
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,038
just how much i've studied stalin

881
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:03,120
recently in the past

882
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:06,558
few years it continues to surprise me

883
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:08,559
not surprise me it's just tragic in some

884
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:10,398
kind of way i'm

885
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:12,719
not sure exactly if i could put wars to

886
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:14,559
it but how many people and still do but

887
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,838
at the time

888
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:19,358
were willing loved stalin and were

889
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,320
willing to die

890
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:22,639
for country for the love of country and

891
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,320
i

892
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:30,480
too maybe because i was born there

893
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,480
and now i am a red-blooded american

894
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:37,599
uh i love nationalism is a bad word but

895
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,679
i love the love of country

896
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:43,519
it gives it somehow gives a meaning

897
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,918
like a brotherhood like we're in this

898
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:45,918
together

899
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:53,838
i love that's why i love the olympics

900
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,039
that's just the the unity of it

901
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,838
it uh takes a step out of the selfish

902
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,880
pursuits of

903
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,639
any one particular ant and looks at us

904
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,640
as a big ant colony

905
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:08,559
and it's inspiring it's uh it's exciting

906
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:10,319
but at the same time it seems to get us

907
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:14,559
to do

908
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:18,079
horrible things if um

909
00:35:14,559 --> 00:35:19,920
if uh manipulated by charismatic leaders

910
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:22,079
what do you make of this love of country

911
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,480
is it a is it a bad thing is it a thing

912
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,119
that gets in the way

913
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,719
or is it a good thing well i think like

914
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,599
anything else

915
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,639
if it's balanced correctly it's great

916
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,800
and if it goes

917
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,639
to some extreme level then it becomes a

918
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,800
negative and i think it

919
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,199
i think it's probably sourced in some

920
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:43,519
sort of

921
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,960
animalistic tribalism that we all have

922
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:48,159
to be part of a tribe

923
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,199
and this is a real big tribe that you

924
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:50,639
get to be a part of

925
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,439
and all you have to do is kind of show

926
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:54,879
up and so when someone says hey

927
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,440
we're going to play hockey against the

928
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,440
russians

929
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:02,399
well we're gonna cheer for the american

930
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,880
boys

931
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,639
so my my area of work is artificial

932
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,480
intelligence

933
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:09,679
it'd be interesting to ask your thoughts

934
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,800
about something which is

935
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:16,159
um autonomous weapon systems us

936
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,560
has now officially

937
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,358
released the report saying that they're

938
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:23,440
open to

939
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:25,039
uh not open they're engaging in in um

940
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,720
adding more and more autonomy in

941
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:29,119
artificial intelligence into its weapon

942
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:31,199
systems because china is doing it

943
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,480
so there's these are the first steps and

944
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:36,559
then something that

945
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:40,000
ai folks worry about which is uh

946
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:42,559
a race an ai race

947
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,599
in the space of autonomous weapons that

948
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,279
can run away

949
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,640
uh too quickly is that something um

950
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,640
i don't know if in general if you have

951
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,879
thoughts about

952
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,239
weapon systems that make autonomous

953
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,720
decisions

954
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,919
at the small scale of just targeting

955
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:59,838
where to shoot

956
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,960
and the largest scale of military

957
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:03,358
strategy

958
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:05,119
of just get being given a mission of

959
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,319
destroy this particular target this

960
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,760
particular

961
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:11,440
say terrorist human being

962
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,760
and then figure out what is the right

963
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:16,000
bombing campaign on your own

964
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,079
to accomplish this task that minimizes

965
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,920
civilian death

966
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,599
and and then just loading that in and

967
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,000
letting the ai system automatically

968
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,359
decide

969
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,239
that what are your general thoughts

970
00:37:25,358 --> 00:37:28,719
about it

971
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:30,559
do you do you worry about it because as

972
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:34,000
the positive effects

973
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:37,039
that in the best version of that world

974
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:41,519
you kill fewer civilians

975
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:44,079
you kill hurt fewer of your own

976
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:45,920
human beings but at the negative side of

977
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,760
that

978
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,680
you might lose the the thing we kind of

979
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,240
talked about which is the basic humanity

980
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,519
even

981
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:57,118
in the individual soldier of what is

982
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,960
right and what is wrong

983
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:04,240
and not making huge mistakes that hurt

984
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,679
thousands or millions of people

985
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,279
i guess what you're asking me is if they

986
00:38:05,679 --> 00:38:10,559
could make a machine that could

987
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,320
do more surgical attacks on

988
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:18,719
enemy individuals would i be for it

989
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:23,039
yes i would be for it the problem is

990
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:26,239
if you've ever used machines of any kind

991
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,960
their initial design may not be there

992
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:30,319
there's unintended consequences there's

993
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,720
uh

994
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:33,760
there's ways in the the machine actually

995
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,039
behaves

996
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,480
that you realize there's bugs in this

997
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,960
thing

998
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,599
so do we not put protocols in place to

999
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,358
prevent

1000
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,760
something from going too far outside the

1001
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,799
boundaries of what we wanted to execute

1002
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,720
you do but the question is uh

1003
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,720
this is the first time in human history

1004
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:57,118
you can create things

1005
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:59,358
machines toaster microwave oven

1006
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,280
that's smarter than you in this

1007
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,838
particular task

1008
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:05,599
i mean it's not yet there what you're

1009
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:07,759
learning a lot with military strategies

1010
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,640
humans are actually really damn smart

1011
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,599
it's very hard to do to improve on a

1012
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:13,598
human

1013
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:16,160
and so most actual drones that are

1014
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:19,359
unmanned are still piloted by humans

1015
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,960
it's very difficult to do every aspect

1016
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:23,119
of war

1017
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,039
but it's not out of the realm of

1018
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,559
possibility that

1019
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:28,079
machines will start doing those things

1020
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:31,440
better in certain certain

1021
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:35,200
things a certain more precise

1022
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,200
targeting of the enemy

1023
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,960
the question is so what happens

1024
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,960
when you start to rely on the machine to

1025
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,000
do some of the task

1026
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:48,480
is you get lazy

1027
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,358
you forget what it is like to do that

1028
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,358
task

1029
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:53,199
or more importantly you lose the

1030
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,239
knowledge of the intricacies of that

1031
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,480
task

1032
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,319
and you forget the ways you can go wrong

1033
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:01,519
so the protocols

1034
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,400
may not be sufficient to constrain the

1035
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,039
power

1036
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,800
of the ways that things go wrong

1037
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,000
especially when things are moving really

1038
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,680
quickly

1039
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,920
especially when the ethics of the two

1040
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:16,639
sides aren't perfectly aligned

1041
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,960
when people are some certain sides like

1042
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:21,920
on the chinese side may be more willing

1043
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,880
to take risks

1044
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,358
for dangerous consequences than others

1045
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,920
so what

1046
00:40:25,358 --> 00:40:28,960
happened on the bioweapon side is

1047
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,280
internationally

1048
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,119
maybe you can speak to this more but my

1049
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,480
sense what i was told

1050
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,240
there's a sense globally that buy

1051
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,800
weapons are not going to be used

1052
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:43,039
they're unethical there's a sense like

1053
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,318
we're not going to engage in this

1054
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:51,599
and with ai currently china

1055
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:54,159
and u.s said green light

1056
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,599
i'll go ahead it's it's totally ethical

1057
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:58,719
if if it can decrease the

1058
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:02,000
loss of human life um

1059
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:05,199
why not my worry is

1060
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,559
that it's much more it's

1061
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:11,759
it's much easier to design weapons

1062
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:14,480
that are effective

1063
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,640
than design weapons who have the the

1064
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,000
depth of ethics

1065
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:21,679
and morals that humans do which i think

1066
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,119
we don't as human beings don't

1067
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,519
acknowledge enough

1068
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,640
that even like the cold calculated

1069
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,719
killing of others

1070
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:31,759
like precise effective execution of a

1071
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,879
mission

1072
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:36,560
still has ethics in it at every level

1073
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,160
you know what's right and what's wrong

1074
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:39,679
and i don't know if that

1075
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,598
i don't know if you take that away

1076
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:43,679
you're not going to make huge mistakes

1077
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:49,200
that you regret

1078
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:52,639
is that something you don't

1079
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:54,799
i don't really worry about it um but

1080
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,639
as you design something like i said you

1081
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,280
you put protocols in place and

1082
00:41:56,639 --> 00:42:00,480
and from what i am hearing you say or

1083
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:02,240
trying to hear you say

1084
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,000
there's be a point where our protocols

1085
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:07,199
wouldn't be

1086
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,760
wouldn't be sufficient to stop the

1087
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:12,078
machine

1088
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,079
from doing something that was unethical

1089
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,440
i'm kind of worried that this is

1090
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,200
something you don't worry about

1091
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,200
because a lot of people i respect don't

1092
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,799
worry about it and i don't know what to

1093
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,118
do about that

1094
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,400
a lot of generals don't worry about it a

1095
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:31,920
lot of people who know

1096
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:35,200
much more about war like you than me

1097
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,358
don't worry about it and that worries me

1098
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:38,239
well that's because you have a vision

1099
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:41,598
into

1100
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:43,838
the shortfalls of a.i and i don't

1101
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:45,680
i don't have a vision of the shortfalls

1102
00:42:43,838 --> 00:42:48,639
of ai i don't know enough about it

1103
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,239
as far as i'm concerned you put a on off

1104
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:54,078
switch somewhere you put a

1105
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:55,759
a kill switch on a system

1106
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,680
and if it starts going awry you hit the

1107
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,839
kill switch and that's it

1108
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:00,719
so if you know when you look at me and

1109
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:02,400
say well there's

1110
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,559
no possible way to put a kill switch

1111
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:07,119
that would be 100 effective and here's

1112
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,799
you draw those concerns to me and we

1113
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,640
could talk through it and say okay

1114
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,480
well here's where we should draw the

1115
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:14,318
line yeah

1116
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,199
i mean it's like again for the soviet

1117
00:43:14,318 --> 00:43:19,519
union chernobyl meltdown

1118
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,480
there's always the ability i believe to

1119
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,838
have a kill switch

1120
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,159
the problem is uh the more power you

1121
00:43:23,838 --> 00:43:32,078
give to the machine

1122
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:33,920
the more opportunity you give to the

1123
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,839
to the human supervising that machine to

1124
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,280
make a mistake and not

1125
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:40,960
shut off the switch at the right time so

1126
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,400
yes the solution i mean you're putting

1127
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,679
the responsibility still in the human

1128
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,639
hands and i think that's the correct

1129
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,239
place to put it

1130
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,199
there should be good protocols good

1131
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,078
leadership good execution competency all

1132
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,719
around

1133
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:54,240
your protocol should consider the basic

1134
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:55,039
failures of human nature the human

1135
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,479
factor

1136
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:58,079
of how things go wrong so there should

1137
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,679
be multiple people supervising the

1138
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,880
system all those things

1139
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,480
but i am just very skeptical

1140
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,440
of greater and greater power in the

1141
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:11,199
machine that can create war

1142
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,039
that can not lead to death yeah and

1143
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,039
that's why like i said and like you just

1144
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:16,880
said you have protocols in place that

1145
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,239
that are a kill switch and if if you

1146
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,400
think about the amount of

1147
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:23,919
nuclear weapons that we've had on planet

1148
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,519
earth for the past however many years

1149
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:29,599
and there's been you know no

1150
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,119
rogue element that said you know what

1151
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,680
i'm gonna shoot this thing there's been

1152
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:33,358
no

1153
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,440
protocol that took place where all of a

1154
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:38,159
sudden we said

1155
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,440
oh no i mean there's been there's been

1156
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:41,759
escalations

1157
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,559
but the protocols worked have worked so

1158
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,680
far

1159
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:48,960
now that's a scary thing to think about

1160
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:51,039
that we rely on these protocols to stop

1161
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,079
some rogue element out there from

1162
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:53,599
launching a

1163
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:55,359
missile that could kill millions of

1164
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:59,119
people and trigger

1165
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:01,679
a global war so yeah the protocol should

1166
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:01,680
be strict

1167
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:06,560
okay ask uh jacqueline a ridiculous

1168
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:09,359
question

1169
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:10,639
if human civilization goes extinct what

1170
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,598
would be the reason

1171
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:15,358
you mention nuclear war do you worry

1172
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:16,880
about this

1173
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,799
the reason i bring that up a lot of

1174
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,400
people in the ai community

1175
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,400
worry about artificial general

1176
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,480
intelligence so super intelligent

1177
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,079
ai systems creating a lot of damage

1178
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,599
autonomous weapon systems is one

1179
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,440
possibility

1180
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:31,200
a lot of folks recently especially with

1181
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,318
this pandemic

1182
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:36,799
if you want to be terrified listen uh

1183
00:45:34,318 --> 00:45:38,318
somebody i talked to recently sam harris

1184
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:42,560
did a four-hour

1185
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:45,358
podcast on how bioengineering of viruses

1186
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,000
is likely to destroy human civilization

1187
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:47,838
i recommend

1188
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,599
that highly if you if you were too

1189
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:50,719
optimistic about the future of the human

1190
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,800
species

1191
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,559
so apparently the in the space of

1192
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,200
bioengineering becomes is becoming

1193
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:01,920
easier and easier and easier to

1194
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:03,980
engineer viruses engineer pathogens

1195
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,440
[Applause]

1196
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,880
[Laughter]

1197
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,720
this is the world's most depressing

1198
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:10,640
question what uh is

1199
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:12,078
do you is there something in particular

1200
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:13,679
you worry about

1201
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,039
like that we should be thinking as a

1202
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:17,039
human species about

1203
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:21,280
uh yeah i'm sorry to disappoint you

1204
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:24,318
again with my lack of worry for

1205
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:28,240
all these problems but i don't worry too

1206
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:30,480
much about it um

1207
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:33,679
you know what we we've made it through a

1208
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,679
bunch of wickets so far as a species and

1209
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:37,679
we'll make it through some more or we

1210
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:39,279
won't and if we don't make it through

1211
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:41,199
some of these wickets and

1212
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,359
someone decides that what they're gonna

1213
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:44,799
do over the weekend is create some crazy

1214
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:48,239
virus that spreads and

1215
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:50,560
kills everybody yeah

1216
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:51,919
you know what uh i'm usually extremely

1217
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,199
optimistic about the stuff i

1218
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:58,880
am now i'm with you except

1219
00:46:55,199 --> 00:46:59,439
we won't well there's always a chance we

1220
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,000
won't

1221
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:03,358
but i have a sense that human first of

1222
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,519
all

1223
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:07,279
i believe that most people have much

1224
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,519
more capacity for good than evil all of

1225
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,240
us are capable of evil i believe but

1226
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:14,960
most people are much more capable of

1227
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:18,078
doing good and want to do good

1228
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,440
and uh i also believe in the resiliency

1229
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,599
of the human species

1230
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,358
that we're an innovative bunch and we

1231
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,680
can respond to tragedy

1232
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,598
especially we respond more to tragedy as

1233
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:30,480
the scale of tragedy grows

1234
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,480
and our response is much better so

1235
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:34,880
that's why i'm not worried about it

1236
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,880
bro

1237
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,039
uh what makes a great man

1238
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,118
let's start at the individual what makes

1239
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:46,558
a great man what makes a great woman

1240
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,559
what makes a great human being

1241
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,159
somebody that puts others above

1242
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,358
themselves

1243
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:56,000
what makes a great leader of humans

1244
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:57,440
same thing but that sentence does a lot

1245
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,599
of work

1246
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,039
there's uh when you're a leader there's

1247
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,800
a lot of egos

1248
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:05,199
there's a lot of tension there's the

1249
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,800
humans the human factor

1250
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:08,239
there's people who are timid there's

1251
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,880
people who are

1252
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:12,558
[ __ ] there's people who are

1253
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,280
incredibly competent but

1254
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:17,119
uh self-obsessed i don't know there's

1255
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,000
complexities of human nature how do you

1256
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:22,160
get all those people

1257
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,679
to do uh to be the best version of

1258
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:26,639
themselves and to lift

1259
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:27,039
up everyone else around them okay so now

1260
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:28,960
that

1261
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:31,039
that question is a little bit different

1262
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,720
now so now it's getting into a

1263
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:34,079
more specific question but at the same

1264
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,399
time a more broad question of

1265
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,519
what elements does it take to make a

1266
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,760
good leader yes

1267
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,358
so you're right that different people

1268
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,839
have different personalities

1269
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,279
different tendencies different levels of

1270
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:49,199
ego

1271
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,800
and the the way that i try and explain

1272
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:53,039
this is

1273
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:54,559
um like a video game and i'm not even a

1274
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:56,000
video game player but i've seen this

1275
00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:00,079
before where video game

1276
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:02,000
characters have various skills

1277
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,599
various strengths and weaknesses so

1278
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,559
maybe they're strong but they're dumb or

1279
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,720
maybe they're strong

1280
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,160
and smart but they're slow they just

1281
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,159
give them these these ratings

1282
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:11,440
and so that's what human beings are and

1283
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,598
that's the way leaders are

1284
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:16,079
and you can have different leaders with

1285
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:17,599
different characteristics

1286
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,519
and depending on how all those

1287
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:22,960
characteristics

1288
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:25,920
match up you can have somebody that

1289
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,318
is very introverted but they're but but

1290
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:29,280
they're

1291
00:49:26,318 --> 00:49:30,639
still a very good leader because when

1292
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,559
they do communicate

1293
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:33,838
they do it in a clear simple manner that

1294
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,200
everyone understands so even though

1295
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:36,000
they're a little bit introverted people

1296
00:49:35,199 --> 00:49:37,759
still

1297
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,760
respect them and listen to them because

1298
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,839
they communicate in a clear way

1299
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,559
you could have somebody that's extremely

1300
00:49:42,838 --> 00:49:47,838
charismatic

1301
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,119
extremely charismatic and everyone looks

1302
00:49:47,838 --> 00:49:51,838
to them but

1303
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:53,680
they're slow in making decisions and so

1304
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:55,358
now we've got someone that

1305
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:56,879
can't really make decisions when

1306
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:58,159
decisions need to get made so

1307
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:00,800
even though they're charismatic they're

1308
00:49:58,159 --> 00:50:02,719
still not a good leader

1309
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,318
so depending on the human being that

1310
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,239
we're talking about and you just

1311
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,159
mentioned earlier that human beings are

1312
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,279
you know more complex than anything and

1313
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,078
do a better job at

1314
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,280
just about everything than a robot so

1315
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,079
that's the same thing with leadership

1316
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,040
you've got all these different

1317
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,880
characteristics and you

1318
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:18,639
you match them or mix them together and

1319
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,960
depending on

1320
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,799
where the ratings come out depending on

1321
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,838
how that thing

1322
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:27,440
does in the end can we almost like as a

1323
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:29,519
case study look at a few people in the

1324
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:30,880
tech area that i'm familiar with that i

1325
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:34,000
know well

1326
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,599
we can the only caveat being that i may

1327
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,119
have no familiarization with them

1328
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,920
whatsoever you may have to brief me on

1329
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:40,240
them yeah

1330
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,440
so i'll do my best to brief i'll do my

1331
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,239
best to reduce

1332
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:45,920
human beings into simple descriptions

1333
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:48,318
and then you can give me insights of why

1334
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,159
the hell they're such effective leaders

1335
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:51,838
uh based on my description not based on

1336
00:50:50,159 --> 00:50:56,239
your actual deep knowledge of the

1337
00:50:51,838 --> 00:50:57,759
human beings uh so uh that caveat of my

1338
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:59,519
inability to speak both the english

1339
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,119
language and describe humans

1340
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:07,119
well let's talk about first elon musk

1341
00:51:03,119 --> 00:51:10,240
so he's known as being quite

1342
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:13,920
harsh in the sense of first of all

1343
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:16,879
a very high bar of excellence

1344
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,559
and also willing to what he calls kind

1345
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,559
of first principles thinking

1346
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:26,160
of asking the the questions that hurt

1347
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,359
which is why the hell are we doing it

1348
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:29,358
this way

1349
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:30,880
why can't it be done a lot but not just

1350
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:34,400
better but a lot better

1351
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,680
so so let's i don't want to hear his

1352
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,200
whole character i'll go want it

1353
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,679
one section at a time so we got a guy

1354
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:42,639
that's harsh yeah

1355
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:44,078
and and asking the really hard questions

1356
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:46,239
how can that be

1357
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,000
good or why is that good well first of

1358
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:49,358
all it can be horrible

1359
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,039
and there's leaders out there that are

1360
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,078
harsh and they're hated and no one likes

1361
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:53,759
them and no one wants to work for them

1362
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,880
and they never do anything

1363
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:59,119
so what is it that elon musk does that

1364
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:00,318
makes gives him the ability to be harsh

1365
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:04,318
so i was

1366
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:07,519
i was hearing a description of

1367
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:11,759
me yeah when i would give feedback

1368
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:15,119
to young seals that had made mistakes

1369
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:18,000
during training operations and

1370
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:18,400
the description was that same thing like

1371
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:21,440
this

1372
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:26,079
harsh blunt force trauma

1373
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:28,240
and just totally direct

1374
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,920
sledgehammer of truth that i would hit

1375
00:52:28,239 --> 00:52:31,519
guys with

1376
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,720
but it's interesting because i always

1377
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:34,000
talk about you know building

1378
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,719
relationships and making sure

1379
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,519
you're not offending someone yeah so how

1380
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:38,959
do these things

1381
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:40,960
match up well i can tell you how they

1382
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,358
match up when i was

1383
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,400
being harsh the guys that i was being

1384
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:47,759
harsh with

1385
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,280
knew without one shred of doubt

1386
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:50,960
that i cared about them more than

1387
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,640
anything else and that the reason i was

1388
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,159
giving them this feedback is because i

1389
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:55,838
wanted them to be able to lead their

1390
00:52:54,159 --> 00:52:56,799
troops i wanted them to be able to go

1391
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:58,318
accomplish their mission

1392
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,280
and i wanted them to be able to bring

1393
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:03,119
their guys home from war

1394
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,280
so i wasn't being harsh because it

1395
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,318
elevated my ego i wasn't being harsh

1396
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,920
because i wanted to

1397
00:53:06,318 --> 00:53:09,920
denigrate them i was being actually

1398
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:12,159
being harsh because i wanted them to

1399
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,280
accomplish the mission

1400
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:17,199
so if that's where elon comes from

1401
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:19,119
hey listen we got to make this happen

1402
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:20,799
this is for this is for the good of the

1403
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:24,318
world to do this

1404
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:26,160
and people know that then it works

1405
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:28,000
i'll bring this point back up with

1406
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,078
another guy steve jobs but let me stay

1407
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,838
on elon for a second

1408
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:36,480
the uh the other thing he does

1409
00:53:33,838 --> 00:53:36,960
which is interesting i'm i see the value

1410
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,358
of this

1411
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,159
it'd be great to hear you uh speak about

1412
00:53:39,358 --> 00:53:45,679
it it's unlike many of the other ceos

1413
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:47,440
very rich billionaires uh

1414
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:50,239
you know involved in leading a lot of

1415
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:50,240
people he

1416
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:55,119
puts a lot of time into making sure he's

1417
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:57,920
on the factory floor

1418
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,519
he famously sleeps on the sort of like

1419
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:02,318
in the middle of things

1420
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:03,358
and he puts a lot of effort he's also

1421
00:54:02,318 --> 00:54:05,679
very good at it

1422
00:54:03,358 --> 00:54:07,199
is being a low-level engineer so like

1423
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,039
whatever the task is

1424
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:10,399
he wants to understand the details and

1425
00:54:09,039 --> 00:54:12,639
he'll talk to

1426
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,480
the lowest level person in terms of like

1427
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:18,000
you know somebody who's

1428
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,119
like uh working literally on putting

1429
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,559
parts together

1430
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,800
he wants to understand what the problem

1431
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:23,760
is what the challenge is if there's an

1432
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,280
emergency

1433
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:27,359
he wants to understand the actual

1434
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,839
details of the problem not like

1435
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:32,159
delegating you to a manager but like

1436
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:34,719
because a lot of ceos a lot of managers

1437
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:37,118
will will talk about sort of the the

1438
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,959
power and the importance of delegation

1439
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:40,318
here he wants to know if there's a big

1440
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,039
problem he wants to know the exact

1441
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,279
detail

1442
00:54:41,039 --> 00:54:44,079
he wants to know the exact problem he

1443
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,680
wants to

1444
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,359
at the fundamental level understand how

1445
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:48,639
to solve that problem

1446
00:54:47,358 --> 00:54:50,239
whether it has to do with materials

1447
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:52,078
whether it has to do with the actual

1448
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:53,919
manufacturing the uh

1449
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:55,519
mechanical engineering aspect like we're

1450
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,079
talking about like engineering

1451
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:58,798
this is a guy who wears a suit there's a

1452
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:01,839
ceo

1453
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:03,519
tweets about deutsche coin but like an

1454
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:06,558
actual job

1455
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,880
he's low level engineering and that to

1456
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,680
me

1457
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,440
was always inspiring to see somebody who

1458
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:13,118
knows

1459
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:16,079
what the [ __ ] they're doing that's what

1460
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:20,400
it like he gains the respect

1461
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:22,240
of engineers at the lowest level

1462
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,000
i don't know if that's scalable but

1463
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,558
that's always been inspiring to me and i

1464
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,159
wonder

1465
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,319
how many people it's inspiring to maybe

1466
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,879
you can speak to the value of doing that

1467
00:55:28,318 --> 00:55:31,119
of

1468
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:33,119
of no matter how high your level of

1469
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:34,240
leader is to be able to do the low level

1470
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,440
[ __ ]

1471
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:39,279
yeah and that's that's a common trait

1472
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,200
that good leaders have

1473
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:43,280
and maybe he doesn't necessarily know

1474
00:55:41,199 --> 00:55:45,199
how to do everything a good leader

1475
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,480
but they go down there and talk to the

1476
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:47,919
front line troops and say

1477
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,599
hey what is the issue that you're

1478
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,280
dealing with or

1479
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,119
you know how can i support you how can i

1480
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,640
give you help and what one key point

1481
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,920
that you said is he said when there's a

1482
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:57,519
problem

1483
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,079
he gets in there so there's things

1484
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:02,400
happening at his companies that

1485
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:04,480
they're working and so he doesn't have

1486
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:06,400
to die i'm not saying he never does but

1487
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:07,599
he doesn't have to spend as much time

1488
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,559
working on

1489
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,680
or or looking at some sub-system that's

1490
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:13,119
functioning well

1491
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:14,558
he's got a good leader in there that's

1492
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:15,680
handling it and he checks in with that

1493
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:18,000
leader and the leader says yeah it's

1494
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,558
working perfectly he says great

1495
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:22,079
that when there's a problem that's when

1496
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,680
he might have to get down there and dig

1497
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,880
into some details so that he fully

1498
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,358
understands it so that

1499
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,440
he when he digs down in the details and

1500
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:31,358
this is important

1501
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,200
he's coming from an altitude where he

1502
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:34,558
has a

1503
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:35,679
better bigger perspective not

1504
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,480
necessarily better but a bigger

1505
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:38,558
perspective

1506
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,000
so if you sit there and work on a

1507
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,240
problem whatever

1508
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,838
for eight hours and you're staring at

1509
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:44,639
you know if you were planning a mission

1510
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:46,639
and you were

1511
00:56:44,639 --> 00:56:47,679
you were planning it for eight hours

1512
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:49,039
you're staring at the

1513
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:50,078
the maps and the charts and you're

1514
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:51,599
figuring out where all the troops are

1515
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,359
going to be located

1516
00:56:51,599 --> 00:56:54,640
and i come in after eight hours and i

1517
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:57,519
look at your plan

1518
00:56:54,639 --> 00:56:58,960
from a from a distant perspective

1519
00:56:57,519 --> 00:56:59,280
there's a good chance i'll be able to

1520
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,960
see

1521
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:03,920
holes in your plan that you couldn't see

1522
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:06,159
because your perspective was too close

1523
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,760
so so that's good for me to be able to

1524
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:08,879
come in from a higher perspective and

1525
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,240
have a look at it

1526
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:13,920
but also there's times where

1527
00:57:12,239 --> 00:57:15,838
i need to get down there and actually

1528
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,200
look you know if you're looking at a

1529
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:18,558
problem you say look i can't figure out

1530
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:19,919
boss i can't figure out how to get to

1531
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,119
this target

1532
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,559
and i'm looking at it from a distance

1533
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:23,280
and i don't see i might need to start

1534
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,920
digging in

1535
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,440
and looking and saying oh here's a route

1536
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,480
that we can take that actually makes

1537
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,200
sense

1538
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:33,599
let's try that so i think it's a good

1539
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:36,078
example of someone

1540
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,359
going up and down in altitude to look at

1541
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:38,720
problems understanding what's happening

1542
00:57:37,358 --> 00:57:40,000
with the front-line troops and at the

1543
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:43,039
same time being able to go

1544
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:46,239
back to the strategic level and i can

1545
00:57:43,039 --> 00:57:47,759
it's probably this way the reason that

1546
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,558
he's successful is because he doesn't

1547
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,640
get stuck

1548
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,040
down there yeah because if he felt the

1549
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:55,118
need to micromanage each and every part

1550
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:57,599
on a tesla

1551
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:59,358
it wouldn't be it would be very unlikely

1552
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,640
that he would have the capacity to do

1553
00:57:59,358 --> 00:58:03,920
all that

1554
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:05,519
now he can hand over some broad

1555
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,798
chip design and say hey this is what the

1556
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:08,159
function needs to be and he gives it to

1557
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:09,119
lex and lex goes there with your team

1558
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:09,920
and you figured out and you make it

1559
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:11,119
happen

1560
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,318
if he had to actually do that all

1561
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:16,318
himself most likely not possible

1562
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:18,079
so that's what leaders should be doing

1563
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,400
they should go elevate and

1564
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,960
and and then get down in the weeds when

1565
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:26,000
they have to and then go back up

1566
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,798
the sad thing this is the part that

1567
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:32,159
makes me not want to do a startup

1568
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:33,440
is basically his whole life is dealing

1569
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:36,879
with emergencies

1570
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:38,720
just like you said he's not dealing

1571
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,640
this is not shooting the [ __ ] about

1572
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:43,199
details of engineering

1573
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:44,318
it's dealing with like in this in the

1574
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,358
case of the company

1575
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:47,759
life and death like something that can

1576
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:50,000
just

1577
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,440
completely damage the production line

1578
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,599
right so he's constantly dealing with

1579
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,519
emergencies putting out fires

1580
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:57,519
and um i don't know if there's something

1581
00:58:55,519 --> 00:59:00,559
to be said about the psychology of that

1582
00:58:57,519 --> 00:59:01,519
of how uh like he he's spoken himself

1583
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,720
that he's worried

1584
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:07,358
whether his mind can hold up much longer

1585
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:07,919
so hopefully in the near future he will

1586
00:59:07,358 --> 00:59:10,400
start to

1587
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:12,000
form more decentralized command where he

1588
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:14,480
has some subordinate leadership

1589
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:16,480
that he fully trusts and most important

1590
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,240
that he has properly trained

1591
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,519
so that they can handle these day-to-day

1592
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:22,318
fires at least

1593
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,199
80 percent of them so only 20 of the

1594
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:25,199
time

1595
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,239
does he actually need to go and solve a

1596
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:28,798
problem

1597
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:30,959
if he's not doing that right now then

1598
00:59:28,798 --> 00:59:32,639
that's going to end up being a problem

1599
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:34,000
anytime so i work with companies all the

1600
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:34,719
time and that's what's interesting about

1601
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,280
this is

1602
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:38,639
i go and work with a ceo or with a with

1603
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,000
the c-suite of a company

1604
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:42,159
it takes a little while to figure out

1605
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,440
what's going on i'm kind of going off of

1606
00:59:42,159 --> 00:59:46,078
the things that you're telling me

1607
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:47,440
yeah almost anecdotally right yes but

1608
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,760
let's say that what you get

1609
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,039
and also i don't know how familiar you

1610
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:55,920
actually are with the

1611
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,920
inner workings of his companies but

1612
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,440
if we were to assume that what you're

1613
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:01,200
saying is accurate then my advice would

1614
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,400
be hey listen

1615
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:04,078
you need to start putting a little bit

1616
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,400
more time and effort into training up

1617
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:09,680
some subordinate leadership that has the

1618
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:11,358
trust knowledge and expertise that you

1619
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:14,078
will be able to turn over

1620
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:15,920
some of these some of these details too

1621
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:18,240
for two reasons number one so you can

1622
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:20,318
let your brain um you know you can you

1623
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:21,519
can survive a little longer as he put it

1624
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:23,199
but also

1625
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:25,358
all the time that you spend as a leader

1626
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:26,719
looking down and into your organization

1627
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:27,279
is time that you're not looking up and

1628
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:28,639
out

1629
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,480
so when you're not looking up and out

1630
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:31,598
you're not seeing what the competitor's

1631
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,599
doing you're not seeing where the

1632
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,760
market's going there's problems that

1633
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,200
that that can come from that so if right

1634
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,240
now he's spending too much time looking

1635
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:39,519
down and in

1636
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:40,399
and you mentioned you know you said i

1637
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:41,599
don't know if i want to do a startup

1638
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,960
when you do a startup you're going to be

1639
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,240
looking down and in for a while

1640
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,358
yeah it's going to take a while you're

1641
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:46,318
going to have to do all this work

1642
01:00:45,358 --> 01:00:47,440
yourself you're not going to have the

1643
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:51,119
finances to put

1644
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,798
people manpower behind these things so

1645
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,480
that's probably he maybe he's in that

1646
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:56,239
mindset a little bit because he's done

1647
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:57,119
so many startups over the years and so

1648
01:00:56,239 --> 01:01:00,639
he's in the

1649
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:02,480
he's habitually in the weeds

1650
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:04,239
so my advice would be all right let's

1651
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:06,240
start looking at formulating some

1652
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:08,159
subordinate leadership that has the like

1653
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:08,558
i said the expertise the trust that you

1654
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:10,798
can

1655
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:11,920
you can start to turn over some of these

1656
01:01:10,798 --> 01:01:14,400
more

1657
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:15,599
minute details to them so you can start

1658
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,720
looking up and out

1659
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,280
yeah i think he's done that more

1660
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:22,798
successfully in some places than others

1661
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,798
the spacex a lot of people give

1662
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:30,159
the credit to gwen shawwal for the ceo

1663
01:01:26,798 --> 01:01:32,079
um the ceo of spacex as

1664
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:33,519
as a very successful person that runs

1665
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:36,798
[ __ ] but

1666
01:01:33,519 --> 01:01:38,559
in tesla not as much so i wonder if you

1667
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:40,079
can comment on

1668
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:41,599
something a lot of people worry about

1669
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:43,599
and this applies to a lot of tech

1670
01:01:41,599 --> 01:01:46,640
companies

1671
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:49,039
which is a lot of people worry about

1672
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:53,440
that if elon disappears

1673
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:56,480
the the innovative spirit the company as

1674
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:59,599
as we know them today will collapse

1675
01:01:56,480 --> 01:02:01,039
will stagnate and will basically fail to

1676
01:01:59,599 --> 01:02:02,480
do what they've been doing for so many

1677
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:05,200
years successfully

1678
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,960
is there some aspect to uh what makes a

1679
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:10,719
good leader that

1680
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,798
if you disappear it's still

1681
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:14,558
the thing still lives on and not just

1682
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:16,079
lives on but thrives

1683
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,160
yeah so what we have to do in those

1684
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,519
situations is we have to establish

1685
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:21,679
a strong culture inside that

1686
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:24,480
organization and

1687
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:26,318
if you're there there's there's reasons

1688
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,960
why this happens right

1689
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:29,838
if i have a big ego and i form a company

1690
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,599
and

1691
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:33,519
i love the fact that everyone looks at

1692
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,440
me and says oh jocko made this company

1693
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:36,798
and he's the creative force behind this

1694
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,079
company and that fuels my ego and it

1695
01:02:36,798 --> 01:02:40,239
makes me feel good

1696
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:42,000
and you know i'm working with you lex

1697
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:44,399
and every time you come up with an idea

1698
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,039
i say lexi you need to stay in your box

1699
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:47,920
yeah

1700
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,200
right so i'm not creating a culture that

1701
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,358
rewards

1702
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,279
that sort of creativity and eventually

1703
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:57,038
when i die

1704
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:59,680
i won't have educated my team

1705
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:00,079
on how to maintain that creative aspect

1706
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:04,399
so

1707
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:08,240
again hopefully inside that organization

1708
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,960
he's he's encouraging and growing that

1709
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:11,919
culture

1710
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,280
where creativity is rewarded where where

1711
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,119
it flourishes

1712
01:03:13,280 --> 01:03:16,559
even when he's gone that's what we have

1713
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:19,920
to hope for

1714
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:23,760
he is but i also seem to notice that

1715
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:26,798
there's not many people like him people

1716
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:29,599
become complacent

1717
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:31,920
too easily that disappoint i've been

1718
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:35,359
disappointed by people a little bit

1719
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:38,720
it's like success makes people soft

1720
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:41,519
now with elon it seems like success

1721
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:42,879
doesn't have any effect that's like the

1722
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:45,119
reverse effect

1723
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,559
it doesn't it's like what's the it's

1724
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:47,200
always like what's the next biggest

1725
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:49,519
thing

1726
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,239
right he's living that exponential

1727
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:53,119
growth

1728
01:03:50,239 --> 01:03:54,639
which i think that's the problem that

1729
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:57,760
you have to have somebody who's

1730
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:58,639
constantly trying to find the 10x

1731
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,599
solution like

1732
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:03,598
trying to constantly improve things and

1733
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:05,039
uh restlessly that

1734
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,480
i mean that probably has to do with

1735
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:07,440
finding the right people not just

1736
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,440
creating the culture

1737
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,358
but creating the culture with the rights

1738
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:15,440
of

1739
01:04:11,358 --> 01:04:18,880
speaking people which steve jobs

1740
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,200
there's uh two things i want to mention

1741
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:21,280
there

1742
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,879
one once again the harshness but a very

1743
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:24,720
different kind

1744
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,280
and the second is team building so on

1745
01:04:24,719 --> 01:04:32,159
the harshness

1746
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:32,160
he is much harsher than elon

1747
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,599
in a way in the following way i'm

1748
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:40,159
having a sense that you will not like

1749
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:43,440
this but i'd like to defend it

1750
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:45,358
is he loses his [ __ ] quite a bit

1751
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,400
he was famously at least especially

1752
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:50,480
early on being very emotional

1753
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:52,720
he's letting passion dominate the

1754
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,400
discussion there'd be a lot of firings

1755
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:56,879
there would be a lot of mean things said

1756
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:56,880
to people

1757
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:02,480
i don't know what you make of that how

1758
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:04,240
much is a leader are you allowed to just

1759
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,358
lose your [ __ ]

1760
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:10,078
in your love for the thing you're doing

1761
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:12,880
and how effective is that as a leader

1762
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:14,798
you shouldn't be doing that very often

1763
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,280
so you can look back at me and say well

1764
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:18,798
jocko here's the most profitable company

1765
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:21,839
that's ever existed

1766
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:24,798
and so you're wrong well

1767
01:05:21,838 --> 01:05:26,400
going back to that multitude of

1768
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:27,119
characteristics that human beings can

1769
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,480
have

1770
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,680
well it's the same thing with businesses

1771
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,679
it's the same thing with companies

1772
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:39,039
steve jobs was off the charts in

1773
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:39,838
some of his traits his ability to

1774
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,119
understand

1775
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:46,798
design yeah his ability to understand

1776
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:50,079
human interface with computer systems

1777
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:53,920
so so far off the charts

1778
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:57,039
that despite his bad temper

1779
01:05:53,920 --> 01:06:00,639
emotional behavior

1780
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:02,880
the company still thrived that's

1781
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:04,000
that can happen you can have people that

1782
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,640
you there's you can have people

1783
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,519
that are horrible leaders that develop

1784
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:10,960
something

1785
01:06:07,519 --> 01:06:14,318
that's so universally

1786
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:17,440
outstanding that you end up with a

1787
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:18,400
a company that's successful i the reason

1788
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,159
i mean i get asked that

1789
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,680
a bunch you know people always ask me

1790
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:23,279
because i say look you you shouldn't be

1791
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:25,199
you shouldn't be losing your temple as

1792
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:26,720
temper as a leader

1793
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:28,558
well what about steve jobs he used to

1794
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:30,318
yell and scream all the time great

1795
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:32,640
i might when people say that to me i say

1796
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:35,119
oh okay are you as good as at design

1797
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:37,118
as steve jobs was are you as good are

1798
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:40,240
you as good at marketing

1799
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:42,400
yeah as steve jobs was there's he had

1800
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:43,519
a certain amount of skills that were off

1801
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,519
the charts

1802
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:46,960
and so he was able to be successful

1803
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:48,880
despite the fact

1804
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,480
that he would lose his temper treat

1805
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:51,358
people horribly that's not that's not

1806
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:53,199
good

1807
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:54,400
it's not good and it would have been

1808
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:55,838
even more successful

1809
01:06:54,400 --> 01:07:01,039
if you if you wouldn't had those

1810
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:04,558
characteristics now you might say well

1811
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:07,599
he his anger is what pushed things

1812
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:10,720
well let me ask you this

1813
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:14,240
what leader wins the leader

1814
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:16,399
whose team is afraid who the

1815
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:18,159
the team who execute executes the

1816
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:18,880
mission because they're afraid of their

1817
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,480
leader

1818
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,640
or executes the task because they're

1819
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,559
afraid of their leader or the team

1820
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:26,558
that loves their leader so much that

1821
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:29,039
they don't want to let them down

1822
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:30,079
which team wins you're implying a

1823
01:07:29,039 --> 01:07:32,559
confidence

1824
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:33,920
that love is more powerful than fear but

1825
01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:35,920
i'm not so sure

1826
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:38,079
this is the machiavelli question you're

1827
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,639
saying ultimately it's always better to

1828
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:42,559
lead

1829
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,558
by uh inspiration and love

1830
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:48,318
putting the fear into the team

1831
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,400
what i'm what i'm saying is that i've

1832
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:53,440
seen countless times

1833
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:56,639
is me leading through my authority

1834
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,920
leading through my rank leading through

1835
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:02,239
punitive measures is infinitely worse

1836
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:05,039
than me and you working together as a

1837
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:05,038
team to win

1838
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:11,759
on the second point of steve jobs

1839
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,519
uh he has this idea a philosophy of a

1840
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:16,960
players

1841
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:20,399
where you have a group

1842
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:25,119
like the power and the productivity

1843
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:28,639
of a group of what he called a players

1844
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:28,960
is invaluable so you want to get a team

1845
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,119
of

1846
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,439
people who are the best at what they do

1847
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:37,039
but the most important aspect to him

1848
01:08:33,439 --> 01:08:39,198
was that a single quote-unquote b player

1849
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,278
on the team destroys the entire

1850
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,960
productivity of the team

1851
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:44,400
is there something that brings true to

1852
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:47,039
that so he was

1853
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:47,519
this could be a temper thing but vicious

1854
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:50,560
about

1855
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:53,679
firing and removing the

1856
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:56,960
what he's felt was a toxic b

1857
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,079
player in a team so a players feed off

1858
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,880
of each other

1859
01:08:58,079 --> 01:09:02,079
unless there's one b player present

1860
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:05,759
depends on the nature of the b

1861
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:09,198
player is the player is the player a b

1862
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:12,640
player because he's a little bit lazy

1863
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:15,519
is he a b player because

1864
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:18,079
he doesn't have good vision is he a b

1865
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:21,199
player because he's got a big ego

1866
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:22,640
and always thinks he's right and now

1867
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,519
creates conflict in the team so there's

1868
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:26,719
a bunch of different b

1869
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:28,159
players look if you're working for me

1870
01:09:26,719 --> 01:09:29,759
and you're kind of a b player but guess

1871
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:30,238
what you're a grinder and you get stuff

1872
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,079
done

1873
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:34,158
i want you on the team you might not be

1874
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:36,798
the smartest person i have

1875
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:37,278
but i know that you're committed to the

1876
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:39,600
team

1877
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:41,359
yeah and i want you on the team so

1878
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:44,480
you're a b player

1879
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:48,079
but that's okay now if you if you're

1880
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:49,358
lex with a giant ego i'd rather have i'd

1881
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:51,198
rather have lex that's

1882
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,719
not quite as smart because i got other

1883
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:53,599
people that are smart i got other people

1884
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:54,800
that are smart on the team look you're

1885
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,000
going to need some smart people on the

1886
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:59,039
team

1887
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:00,399
but a team is made up it's a team

1888
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:02,479
and so you take these different

1889
01:10:00,399 --> 01:10:04,000
components of a team and if you have

1890
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:07,759
complementary components

1891
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,760
you'll end up with a superior team

1892
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:11,839
than just basing it on the level of and

1893
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,880
what's an a player

1894
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,560
sometimes in the seal teams

1895
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,719
they would get something called the

1896
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:21,520
stacked platoon

1897
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:24,319
and what that would be is someone you

1898
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:27,440
know some senior person in that platoon

1899
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:30,399
would manipulate and and and maneuver

1900
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:31,839
to get the quote best guys that he could

1901
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:32,960
in that platoon so you know the most

1902
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:34,239
experienced guys

1903
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:36,880
the person that had great great

1904
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:38,158
reputations and sometimes those platoons

1905
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:40,239
would be great

1906
01:10:38,158 --> 01:10:42,000
sometimes they would implode because

1907
01:10:40,238 --> 01:10:45,198
what you end up with is a bunch of

1908
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:46,960
a players and now no one wants to

1909
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:48,238
follow anyone else no one wants to agree

1910
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:50,079
with someone else everyone wants to do

1911
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:51,839
it my way not it's my way not lex's way

1912
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:54,880
lex is stupid no you're stupid

1913
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:58,880
we end up with problems so can

1914
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:01,199
one person derail a team absolutely

1915
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:04,480
under good leadership one person should

1916
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:04,479
not derail a team

1917
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,679
this could be a tech thing too there's

1918
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:11,679
some

1919
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:15,840
multiplying effect of just pure

1920
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:15,840
excellence no matter the personalities

1921
01:11:16,238 --> 01:11:21,919
i think for steve jobs he doesn't

1922
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,840
the ego doesn't matter none of that

1923
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,960
matters what matters is the quality of

1924
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:28,000
the output

1925
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:30,319
the the genius of the result and that

1926
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,198
somehow multiplies itself and the egos

1927
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:34,479
actually

1928
01:11:31,198 --> 01:11:36,960
like one of the problems with egos

1929
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:38,639
is uh like what does ego usually say it

1930
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:40,158
says i'm much better than you

1931
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,560
when you have people that are really

1932
01:11:40,158 --> 01:11:44,079
good together it's very hard for the ego

1933
01:11:42,560 --> 01:11:45,760
to flourish because you're like

1934
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:46,559
constantly being shown that you're not

1935
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,960
as good

1936
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:50,000
and there's a competition so like i

1937
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:52,079
think to his

1938
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,158
his idea was that like if you get people

1939
01:11:52,079 --> 01:11:56,880
that are really good at what they do

1940
01:11:54,158 --> 01:11:59,359
it turns as opposed to you being

1941
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:00,960
complacent and not doing much

1942
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:03,039
and thinking you're better than everyone

1943
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:05,198
else and your opinion is better is you

1944
01:12:03,039 --> 01:12:06,800
almost getting in that competitive race

1945
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:07,599
you know that magic that happens when

1946
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,600
you're

1947
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:11,199
at the end of a marathon and you're just

1948
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,600
like head to head like

1949
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:14,319
you're just going full steam with a

1950
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,079
person that is

1951
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:18,079
as good as you there's no place for ego

1952
01:12:16,079 --> 01:12:20,960
there which is great

1953
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:22,000
which is great let's use that example

1954
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,079
you and i are racing

1955
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,560
we're at the end of the marathon we're

1956
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:28,319
both highly competitive

1957
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,840
highly competitive we have massive egos

1958
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:33,039
and we both want to win

1959
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:37,119
we both want to win so bad

1960
01:12:33,039 --> 01:12:39,519
that we we give everything we've got

1961
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:40,719
that's totally positive right yeah isn't

1962
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,760
that totally positive

1963
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:45,840
now imagine this same thing

1964
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:47,280
we're in a race we're in a marathon

1965
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,840
we're in the last hundred meters

1966
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:51,439
it's you against me and and our egos are

1967
01:12:49,840 --> 01:12:54,800
huge and we're pushing to win

1968
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:56,960
and you start to pull ahead of me and my

1969
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,159
ego is so big

1970
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:02,880
and i hate losing so much

1971
01:13:00,158 --> 01:13:04,799
that i somehow accidentally push my knee

1972
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:08,159
up against your foot on a backstride and

1973
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:11,279
throw you onto your face yeah so

1974
01:13:08,158 --> 01:13:13,679
that's what ego is an awesome driver

1975
01:13:11,279 --> 01:13:14,880
unless you let your ego control you yeah

1976
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:16,399
and you let ego

1977
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:18,400
drive your decision-making process in

1978
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:20,960
which case it turns into

1979
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:22,079
an incredible problem so you might have

1980
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:24,560
someone that is

1981
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:25,679
excellent you might have someone that's

1982
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,760
outstanding

1983
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,039
you might have some someone that's tens

1984
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:30,960
across the board

1985
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:33,119
but their ego is so big that big that

1986
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,880
they can't work with other people

1987
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:36,158
they can't accept anyone else's ideas

1988
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:37,359
they can't compromise on something

1989
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:38,399
because they think their idea is better

1990
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:41,599
all the time

1991
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:44,319
and that is going to be problematic

1992
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:46,079
and i don't want them on the team now as

1993
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:48,960
a good leader guess what i'll do

1994
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:51,279
i'll put them into a situation where i

1995
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:55,119
can utilize their best aspects

1996
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:57,359
but not have their ego destroy the team

1997
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:59,198
so i might say hey lex you know what i

1998
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:01,839
actually want you to take lead on this

1999
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:02,559
part of the project over here and since

2000
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:04,719
you're so

2001
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:05,840
smart and you you work so hard i know

2002
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:06,560
you're going to pull ahead of everyone

2003
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,199
else so

2004
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,159
you grind on that once you get that

2005
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:11,039
result

2006
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:14,079
give it to me and i'm going to

2007
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:17,279
disseminate it to the team basically i i

2008
01:14:14,079 --> 01:14:19,039
isolate you from wrecking yourself and

2009
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:22,158
the rest of the team

2010
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:23,920
with your giant ego

2011
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:25,759
so then uh looking at a completely

2012
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:28,640
opposite person was this a fascinating

2013
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:32,079
person to me sandra pachai who's the ceo

2014
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:35,840
of alphabet ceo of google

2015
01:14:32,079 --> 01:14:39,920
i admire the in a romantic

2016
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:43,279
sense the madness that is

2017
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:46,480
steve jobs and elon musk so

2018
01:14:43,279 --> 01:14:51,519
to me the opposite of that is who's uh

2019
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:54,799
like everybody loves him

2020
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,719
and uh he's also a great listener so he

2021
01:14:54,800 --> 01:14:59,760
always brings people together and so

2022
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:01,600
when the the energy of that person in a

2023
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,440
room is like

2024
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:06,000
the basic energy if i were to summarize

2025
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:07,198
it is like i want to hear all the voices

2026
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:11,198
in the room

2027
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:13,759
that's the energy he brings and

2028
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:15,439
it's almost like he doesn't want to

2029
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:17,600
impose a final decision

2030
01:15:15,439 --> 01:15:19,039
he wants to hear all the voices and

2031
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:22,480
somehow always

2032
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:25,198
the decision just falls out i don't know

2033
01:15:22,479 --> 01:15:26,319
what to say about that style of

2034
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:30,559
leadership but it's always

2035
01:15:26,319 --> 01:15:32,319
surprising to me how

2036
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,920
that love brought a lot of people

2037
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,840
together and still

2038
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,760
i mean some of the greatest things

2039
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:41,199
google has done over the past

2040
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,760
several years could be attributed to

2041
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:44,319
that

2042
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,840
continued innovation bringing out the

2043
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:47,519
best out of people there's of course

2044
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,880
bureaucracy which i could criticize

2045
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,120
the end of the day which always happens

2046
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,760
with big companies i would argue

2047
01:15:51,119 --> 01:15:54,158
actually

2048
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,079
the dictatorial style of steve jobs and

2049
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:58,319
elon musk helped fight the bureaucracy

2050
01:15:56,079 --> 01:16:00,800
which is one criticism i would give

2051
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:02,079
of being a listener and being kind it's

2052
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,840
sometimes you can't cut through the

2053
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,559
[ __ ] as effectively

2054
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,279
but he he's one of the only people i've

2055
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:11,600
ever heard of who everybody loves

2056
01:16:09,279 --> 01:16:12,639
he's an inspirational figure to millions

2057
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,360
especially

2058
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,800
like in india he's a celebrity in the

2059
01:16:15,359 --> 01:16:18,000
best kind of way

2060
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,000
is there something you could say about

2061
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,319
that kind of leadership where

2062
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,439
you're never the [ __ ] you're never

2063
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:27,198
the dictator

2064
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:27,198
you're always the listener and the

2065
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:32,079
the compassionate empathetic glue that

2066
01:16:30,238 --> 01:16:35,519
brings the team together

2067
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:39,359
basically with love yeah that's that's

2068
01:16:35,520 --> 01:16:42,719
great leadership if you have to choose

2069
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:45,679
for google uh

2070
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:47,600
for large companies is there something

2071
01:16:45,679 --> 01:16:49,119
to be said about what is more effective

2072
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:54,400
the dictator

2073
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:54,399
the uh ruling by love or ruling by fear

2074
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:58,159
first of all everything's a dichotomy

2075
01:16:56,640 --> 01:17:00,480
right and so

2076
01:16:58,158 --> 01:17:02,319
to think that all the time you're always

2077
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:03,919
going to be able to

2078
01:17:02,319 --> 01:17:05,119
just bark orders at people and they're

2079
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,239
always going to listen to you and you're

2080
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:08,640
always going to get the best result

2081
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:09,759
that would not be smart to think that

2082
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,400
every single time

2083
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:14,079
you're going to come to a 100 consensus

2084
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:15,759
amongst the troops

2085
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:18,000
and that decision is going to reveal

2086
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:21,360
itself without you nudging it along

2087
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:24,158
that would also be short-sighted and

2088
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:25,359
naive so what you what a good leader

2089
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:27,439
does is they

2090
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:29,439
they they stay balanced and as much as

2091
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:30,319
they can they listen to what the troops

2092
01:17:29,439 --> 01:17:33,198
have to say

2093
01:17:30,319 --> 01:17:34,799
they take that feedback maybe they

2094
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:36,799
quietly nudge things and

2095
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:38,159
and i'm sure he does that i'm sure he

2096
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,800
does some nudging that

2097
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:42,479
maybe no one even picks up on you know i

2098
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:43,279
like to say the the best forms of

2099
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:44,879
leadership

2100
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:46,639
is leadership with minimum force

2101
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:49,039
required so

2102
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:51,119
if i can go into a room as a leader and

2103
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:52,479
not say one single thing and the team

2104
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:53,760
can come to the right consensus and move

2105
01:17:52,479 --> 01:17:55,039
in that direction that's my preferred

2106
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,480
method

2107
01:17:55,039 --> 01:17:58,800
maybe i have to give them a little bit

2108
01:17:56,479 --> 01:18:00,799
of a nudge a 10 nudge in one direction

2109
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:02,560
okay that's better than me walking in

2110
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:05,920
there and giving them 100

2111
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:07,520
dictatorial direction of exactly what i

2112
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:09,600
want to have happen

2113
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:10,960
now occasionally if we have an emergency

2114
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:13,199
situation

2115
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:15,119
people are starting to be frazzled and

2116
01:18:13,198 --> 01:18:16,399
they're not sure which direction to go

2117
01:18:15,119 --> 01:18:17,920
then sometimes as a leader you have to

2118
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:19,920
walk in and say all right everyone

2119
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:23,039
here's where we're going

2120
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:24,079
and people get on board why because for

2121
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:26,640
many years or

2122
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:27,519
months or however long you've trusted

2123
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:30,079
them

2124
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:31,679
to come up with a plan and when you try

2125
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:33,600
when you as a leader trust your team to

2126
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:36,319
come up with a plan

2127
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,000
the team starts to trust you and you get

2128
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:39,198
leadership capital and as you build

2129
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,679
leadership capital

2130
01:18:39,198 --> 01:18:42,799
occasionally you need to cash in some of

2131
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:43,760
that leadership capital you need to

2132
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:45,840
spend some of it

2133
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,360
and maybe it is hey listen here's the

2134
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:49,279
direction we're going right now

2135
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:50,960
we'll debrief it later but we got to

2136
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:53,920
make a move and the team

2137
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:56,239
who trusts you says roger that boss we

2138
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,239
got it

2139
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,199
and all of them actually do this

2140
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,199
interesting thing i'd love to hear your

2141
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:02,879
opinion on it

2142
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:05,599
asander certainly does it to a large

2143
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:05,600
degree which is

2144
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:12,960
it's in the process of delegation

2145
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:14,480
trusting a person to do a really

2146
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,760
difficult thing

2147
01:19:14,479 --> 01:19:21,439
like tossing it up

2148
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:24,480
uh saying like i trust

2149
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:27,039
you can get this job done

2150
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:28,158
for some even if your resume does not

2151
01:19:27,039 --> 01:19:31,119
support that

2152
01:19:28,158 --> 01:19:33,679
i'm actually kind of uh amazed the human

2153
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:35,760
beings when they're given the trust

2154
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:38,000
to get the job done they step up very

2155
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:40,079
often that's kind of an amazing property

2156
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,760
of human nature

2157
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,600
people often ask me issues about

2158
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,159
leadership and i always say that one of

2159
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,640
the best

2160
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:48,399
tools for teaching leadership and for

2161
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:51,039
teaching a bunch of other lessons

2162
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:52,000
is leadership itself yeah so when it

2163
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:53,198
happens all the time

2164
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,079
when you elevate someone into a

2165
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:58,319
leadership position they do step up

2166
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:00,158
and they do make things happen so that's

2167
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:03,439
not surprising to me

2168
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:06,000
you do have to mitigate risk so

2169
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:07,599
saying hey you know lex i know you're

2170
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,198
haven't been in the military before i

2171
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,679
know you have

2172
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:12,719
very limited weapons experience but i

2173
01:20:11,679 --> 01:20:15,840
want you to run

2174
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:17,359
a target assault on a real mission in

2175
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:19,279
whatever country

2176
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:20,880
that would not be good that would not be

2177
01:20:19,279 --> 01:20:22,399
a good move on on my part

2178
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,600
now if i said all right lex you know

2179
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:24,960
what i want you to get some leadership

2180
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:26,719
experience

2181
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:28,000
i've got a training mission and it's

2182
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:29,920
going to be using paintball

2183
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:33,520
and i'm going to put you in charge of it

2184
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:36,960
i got no problem doing that

2185
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,400
some of that is judging human character

2186
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:40,719
it's like there's potential there's

2187
01:20:38,399 --> 01:20:43,198
something in this person

2188
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:45,039
that they are they have enough demons or

2189
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:46,000
whatever the hell it requires to have

2190
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:48,800
that fuel they'll

2191
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,600
figure it out they'll hate themselves if

2192
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,079
they don't

2193
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:54,079
and they'll find the right they'll find

2194
01:20:52,079 --> 01:20:55,840
the tools they'll find the path they'll

2195
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:57,359
to to achieve the whatever the level of

2196
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,719
perfection they can it's been really

2197
01:20:57,359 --> 01:21:00,799
surprising to me it's been

2198
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:02,079
making me rethink of the whole hiring

2199
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,360
process

2200
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:07,119
because i often now i'm thinking looking

2201
01:21:05,359 --> 01:21:09,279
so i'm looking for people both for the

2202
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:12,399
startup but just for my own life

2203
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:14,880
for help and i almost want to see

2204
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:18,079
evidence of excellence

2205
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:20,560
but maybe you want to just based on

2206
01:21:18,079 --> 01:21:22,158
just judgment of human character without

2207
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:25,280
evidence of excellence

2208
01:21:22,158 --> 01:21:28,319
have people step up like

2209
01:21:25,279 --> 01:21:30,158
joe rogan with jamie it's a funny side i

2210
01:21:28,319 --> 01:21:31,119
didn't understand how little joe knew

2211
01:21:30,158 --> 01:21:33,920
about jamie

2212
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:35,760
when he hired him and jamie stepped up

2213
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:38,000
and now runs one of the most successful

2214
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:39,520
podcasts ever and that's an incredible

2215
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:41,679
kind of

2216
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:42,960
and he's one of the best producers in

2217
01:21:41,679 --> 01:21:44,880
the world now

2218
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,719
not to let it get to his head and by the

2219
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:48,319
way the funny thing about him and one of

2220
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,439
the best googlers in the world about the

2221
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:52,000
best googlers

2222
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:52,719
the the funny thing about jamie this is

2223
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,960
okay

2224
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:56,560
you might not like this but what i what

2225
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:58,399
i like

2226
01:21:56,560 --> 01:22:01,440
i'm constantly exceptionally

2227
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:03,519
self-critical to a point of like

2228
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:05,839
self-hating sometimes i deeply

2229
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,199
appreciate every single moment i'm alive

2230
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:08,960
but everything i've ever done i feel

2231
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:10,719
like is [ __ ]

2232
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,158
and when i talk to jamie about

2233
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:14,880
everything he's done

2234
01:22:12,158 --> 01:22:16,559
he's so just in every way he carries

2235
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,560
himself he's so self-critical

2236
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:20,080
he's so like worried that it's wrong

2237
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:23,520
it's bad

2238
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:25,519
that anxious energy i love it

2239
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:26,960
because that's how you lead growth and

2240
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:29,199
progress like you might

2241
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,480
like a therapist might say that's

2242
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:31,839
probably not good for your like

2243
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:34,879
well-being

2244
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:36,319
[ __ ] it it's good for the

2245
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,400
what's good for your well-being is to

2246
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:38,719
create awesome things that's ultimately

2247
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:40,799
what

2248
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:43,198
leads to happiness is to to create the

2249
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:45,520
best thing you can in your life

2250
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:46,399
and uh so when i see that in in somebody

2251
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,239
like jamie or

2252
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:50,559
anybody i talk to when you're really

2253
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:52,959
self-critical that's a good sign to me

2254
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,480
is that ridiculous that's not ridiculous

2255
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,800
at all and it goes back you know you

2256
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:56,638
were

2257
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,480
you were the way you were phrasing these

2258
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:01,199
questions about what makes a good person

2259
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:04,079
and what makes a good leader

2260
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:05,198
the way you phrase them kind of

2261
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:08,479
eliminated

2262
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:10,319
the normal answer that i give the normal

2263
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:12,718
answer that i give you ask me what makes

2264
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:15,759
a good leader what makes a good person

2265
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:18,319
is is being humble

2266
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,199
so when you're going to hire someone for

2267
01:23:18,319 --> 01:23:20,880
your

2268
01:23:19,198 --> 01:23:22,719
for your startup or whatever company

2269
01:23:20,880 --> 01:23:24,639
you're creating that is

2270
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:26,560
a key characteristic to look for is

2271
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:29,279
someone that has the humility

2272
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:29,840
like like young jamie to say yeah you

2273
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:31,279
know i

2274
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:32,800
i could have done this better and here's

2275
01:23:31,279 --> 01:23:34,639
what i can improve and here's what i

2276
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:36,560
need to work on when you have somebody

2277
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:39,840
that thinks they know everything

2278
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:41,039
um out of the gate you're you're already

2279
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,079
got someone that's gonna be hard to deal

2280
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:44,000
with they're gonna be hard to coach

2281
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:45,279
they're gonna be hard to mentor

2282
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,198
when you have somebody that's truly

2283
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:48,000
humble you barely again it's minimum

2284
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:50,799
force required

2285
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:52,399
because when you say to jamie after a

2286
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:53,920
show how do you think that went he says

2287
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:55,599
well you know i did this wrong and i

2288
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:56,880
didn't have this set up in time and

2289
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:58,960
you don't you don't barely have to do

2290
01:23:56,880 --> 01:24:00,159
anything because he's got the humility

2291
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,800
if you've got someone that's a big ego

2292
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:05,759
and you say hey how did that show go

2293
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:07,119
he goes i went awesome on my end now

2294
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:07,679
guess what you have to do now you have

2295
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:09,519
to start

2296
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:10,960
applying force as a leader which is

2297
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:12,400
expending leadership capital which we

2298
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:12,639
don't want to do because we always try

2299
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:14,079
and

2300
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:16,159
conserve our leadership capital as much

2301
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:18,238
as we possibly can and when we have to

2302
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:21,039
expend it just to get

2303
01:24:18,238 --> 01:24:22,158
jamie to make some improvements that's

2304
01:24:21,039 --> 01:24:24,079
bad

2305
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:25,359
so when you go looking for people look

2306
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:26,639
for people that are humble now does this

2307
01:24:25,359 --> 01:24:28,158
mean you look for people that don't have

2308
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:29,520
any confidence no that's not what i'm

2309
01:24:28,158 --> 01:24:31,359
saying there's a balance to all these

2310
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:34,480
things it's the dichotomy of leadership

2311
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:37,519
you but people tend towards

2312
01:24:34,479 --> 01:24:38,559
and look i work with a lot of military

2313
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,560
troops in the past

2314
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,080
now i work with companies the reason i

2315
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,719
talk about humility all the time is

2316
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:46,479
because

2317
01:24:42,719 --> 01:24:47,359
for someone to be get into a leadership

2318
01:24:46,479 --> 01:24:49,279
position

2319
01:24:47,359 --> 01:24:51,839
in the military they have to have

2320
01:24:49,279 --> 01:24:54,000
confidence so the tendency is

2321
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:56,319
that their confidence is going to

2322
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,800
outweigh their humility at some point

2323
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:01,119
same thing with with civilian companies

2324
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:02,960
if you get to a point of leadership

2325
01:25:01,119 --> 01:25:04,399
inside of a company you have to have

2326
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:06,158
confidence to get there you don't

2327
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,638
get to a position of leadership inside

2328
01:25:06,158 --> 01:25:12,879
of company lacking confidence

2329
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:15,199
so the tendency is for confidence to

2330
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,319
to grow a little bit too much and we

2331
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:18,079
have to put that

2332
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:19,359
put that confidence into check we have

2333
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:21,920
to put that ego in a check

2334
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:23,359
really good leaders they're confident

2335
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,520
but they're humble that's the balance of

2336
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:29,039
the dichotomy

2337
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:31,440
hear that jamie don't get cocky

2338
01:25:29,039 --> 01:25:32,719
on occasion rarely you talk about uh

2339
01:25:31,439 --> 01:25:35,839
discipline

2340
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:40,480
what does a disciplined life look like

2341
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:42,480
doing what you're supposed to do

2342
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:43,519
what if i want to lay on the couch and

2343
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:46,718
eat cheetos

2344
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:48,080
and watch soap operas that's

2345
01:25:46,719 --> 01:25:50,480
that's not that doesn't feel like

2346
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:54,079
discipline do you think you're supposed

2347
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:56,718
to do that

2348
01:25:54,079 --> 01:25:58,000
well you know you could argue from a a

2349
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:00,239
sort of uh

2350
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:02,000
meaning of life perspective that perhaps

2351
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,839
happiness is the most important and if

2352
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:08,639
it makes me happy

2353
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:09,920
uh perhaps that's um if it's fulfilling

2354
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:11,520
of course eating cheetos and watching

2355
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,359
snow propers is fulfilling for nobody

2356
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,920
whatsoever

2357
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:17,679
next question but there's something

2358
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:20,399
about discipline that's more than that

2359
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:24,639
which is um

2360
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:27,599
like the rigor of habit right you

2361
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:29,119
you wake up early in the morning all the

2362
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:30,880
time

2363
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:32,559
uh what is it jordan peterson talks

2364
01:26:30,880 --> 01:26:34,480
about make your bed

2365
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:35,679
it's one place we probably agree with

2366
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:38,959
jordan

2367
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:40,560
people ask me if i make my bed i don't

2368
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:42,800
and i never know there's a disagreement

2369
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:45,760
with jordan there we go

2370
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,920
you know when i was uh younger before i

2371
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:51,440
was married i didn't make my bed because

2372
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:53,199
i had one sleeping bag on it

2373
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:55,279
and i would get out a sleeping bag there

2374
01:26:53,198 --> 01:26:58,238
was nothing to make yeah

2375
01:26:55,279 --> 01:26:59,920
now i'm married and i can't make my bed

2376
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:02,399
because my wife's in my bed so i don't

2377
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,399
make my bed

2378
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:07,679
okay so what in your life

2379
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:09,199
maybe we can talk about the one that's

2380
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:12,000
most publicly facing

2381
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:14,319
which is uh you wake up at four o'clock

2382
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:19,119
or around four o'clock in the morning

2383
01:27:14,319 --> 01:27:22,319
you post uh on social media

2384
01:27:19,119 --> 01:27:23,840
a a picture of your watch it being early

2385
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:28,238
just to remind people that

2386
01:27:23,840 --> 01:27:30,159
uh you're you uh are man of your word

2387
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:32,638
what's that about what's the philosophy

2388
01:27:30,158 --> 01:27:33,920
of the four o'clock

2389
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:36,400
what role does that play in a

2390
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,079
disciplined life for you

2391
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:40,960
okay from that perspective what role it

2392
01:27:38,079 --> 01:27:43,840
plays is getting a jump on the day

2393
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:45,198
and i when you wake up early and you get

2394
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,719
a jump on the day and you've got your

2395
01:27:45,198 --> 01:27:47,039
workout done and you've got a little bit

2396
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,760
of

2397
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:51,279
a little bit of work done yeah by the

2398
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,079
time

2399
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:54,719
normal people are getting up that's a

2400
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:56,479
win

2401
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:57,840
that's a psychological win and it's not

2402
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:01,119
just a psychological win it's an

2403
01:27:57,840 --> 01:28:02,880
actual win it's an actual win so

2404
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:04,639
that feels great it doesn't feel great

2405
01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:07,199
maybe when your alarm clock goes off

2406
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:08,960
but by eight o'clock in the morning and

2407
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:11,359
you've already accomplished

2408
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:13,279
some of the major tasks that you have

2409
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:14,799

2434
01:29:14,319 --> 01:29:18,880
variety of things

2435
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:20,480
this is the thing that has the pictures

2436
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:22,880
of the aftermath with some

2437
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:24,399
this is some sweat at the end so the

2438
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,560
goal is to do whatever the hell

2439
01:29:24,399 --> 01:29:27,439
results in some sweat and that takes an

2440
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:29,760
hour

2441
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:31,279
sometimes it takes 12 minutes sometimes

2442
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:34,560
it takes three hours

2443
01:29:31,279 --> 01:29:37,759
depending on what kind of

2444
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:38,000
mood i'm in you got some demons to work

2445
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:40,880
through

2446
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,479

with david goggins is like

2457

01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:02,159
that you're trying to get out through

2459
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,679
some of the exercise

2461
01:30:03,679 --> 01:30:09,119

silly looking man on a board

2482
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:57,520
you could say it's the infinite power of

2483
01:30:55,600 --> 01:31:00,800
the ocean versus a silly looking man on

2484
01:30:57,520 --> 01:31:02,560
a board or you could say it's fun

reading talking to clients

2511
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:55,840

to

2513
01:31:55,840 --> 01:32:01,600
find moments to think deeply to read

2514
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,800
deeply to sort of really focus because

2515
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:05,120
this world wants

2516
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:05,840

2520
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:13,279
they can scatter your mind is there

2521
01:32:12,479 --> 01:32:16,000

01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:53,600
being a practitioner you're a black belt

2593
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,600
what have you learned from this journey

2594
01:34:54,238 --> 01:35:00,718
of uh being a martial artist

2595
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,319
jiu jitsu for me was the connective

2596
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:05,679
tissue

2597
01:35:02,319 --> 01:35:07,599
that started to join my mind together

2598
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:08,880
with all the different aspects of my

2599
01:35:07,600 --> 01:35:11,600
life

2600
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:12,159
and so jiu jitsu for me was was really

2601
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:13,520
important

2602
01:35:12,158 --> 01:35:14,799
and i don't think i would be doing

2603
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:16,480
anything that i'm doing right now if it

2604
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,840
wasn't for jiu jitsu

2605
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:22,718
so there's various aspects of my life

2606
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:24,319
that were in existence but i didn't

2607
01:35:22,719 --> 01:35:25,920
understand how they were connected until

2608
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:28,399
i started training jiu jitsu

2609
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:30,319
the primary things are interacting with

2610
01:35:28,399 --> 01:35:33,679
other human beings

2611
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:36,479
and combat tactics

2612
01:35:33,679 --> 01:35:37,520
and strategy and jiu jitsu and all those

2613
01:35:36,479 --> 01:35:39,279
things are connected

2614
01:35:37,520 --> 01:35:40,960
they all follow the same guiding

2615
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:42,960
principles and i wouldn't have

2616
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:46,480
recognized those guiding principles

2617
01:35:42,960 --> 01:35:48,079
if i didn't do jiu jitsu

2618
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:49,919
can you elaborate because you've trained

2619
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:53,279
for many many years

2620
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:54,880
what um is it the hardship is it the

2621
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:55,519
humbling nature of just being tapped all

2622
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,639
over

2623
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:00,080
you know non-stop i don't i actually

2624
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:02,960
don't know how many times

2625
01:36:00,079 --> 01:36:03,920
i've tapped more times than you okay so

2626
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:06,239
good

2627
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:08,079
is it just the hardship of physical

2628
01:36:06,238 --> 01:36:09,678
training like the honesty of the mat in

2629
01:36:08,079 --> 01:36:11,039
the sense that like

2630
01:36:09,679 --> 01:36:13,600
you know what works and what doesn't

2631
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:17,118
work which which aspects were the most

2632
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:19,520
uh impactful for you all aspects so yes

2633
01:36:17,118 --> 01:36:20,238
from a humility perspective when you

2634
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,760
realize

2635
01:36:20,238 --> 01:36:23,039
you think when you think you know what

2636
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,480
you're doing when you think you have

2637
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:25,600
certain skills

2638
01:36:24,479 --> 01:36:26,959
and you realize that there's always

2639
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,320
somebody better than you and you realize

2640
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,760
that hey maybe i don't have all the

2641
01:36:28,319 --> 01:36:31,359
answers all the time

2642
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:33,520
and you bring that to a leadership

2643
01:36:31,359 --> 01:36:34,799
perspective and you walk into your

2644
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:35,360
platoon and you realize that maybe you

2645
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:36,560
don't have

2646
01:36:35,359 --> 01:36:37,519
all the answers all the time and maybe

2647
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:38,719
you should listen to what other people

2648
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:41,199
have to say

2649
01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:42,800
you bring that to a combat situation and

2650
01:36:41,198 --> 01:36:44,079
you realize that you think

2651
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:46,639
if you sit there and think that you're

2652
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:49,198
smarter than the enemy you're gonna be

2653
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:50,480
complacent you're gonna make mistakes so

2654
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:55,279
there's one aspect

2655
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:55,279
out of the gate as far as

2656
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:58,880
you know if i if i'm going to try and

2657
01:36:57,279 --> 01:37:01,920
get your arm

2658
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,920
do i attack your arm

2659
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:05,519
maybe not directly unless i'm a white

2660
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:07,118
belt exactly

2661
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:08,880
what do i do i attack your neck and when

2662
01:37:07,118 --> 01:37:11,279
you reach up to defend your neck

2663
01:37:08,880 --> 01:37:12,480
that's when i get your arm well if i'm

2664
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:14,559
out on the battlefield

2665
01:37:12,479 --> 01:37:15,519
and there's an enemy position should i

2666
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,719
attack

2667
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:20,639
frontal assault into that position

2668
01:37:18,719 --> 01:37:22,158
no no i shouldn't i should put down some

2669
01:37:20,639 --> 01:37:23,039
covering fire and i should maneuver

2670
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:25,118
around to the flank

2671
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:26,960
it's the same thing if i'm dealing with

2672
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:29,039
you and you're my boss

2673
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,239
and you've got a giant ego and you've

2674
01:37:29,039 --> 01:37:31,519
come up with a plan and i don't like

2675
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:32,079
your plan should i walk up to you and

2676
01:37:31,520 --> 01:37:34,719
say

2677
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:35,679
hey lex your plan isn't good no or

2678
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:37,920
should i say

2679
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:39,600
hey lex can i ask you some questions

2680
01:37:37,920 --> 01:37:40,000
about how you want us to execute this

2681
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,360
because

2682
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:42,520
i want to make sure i understand your

2683
01:37:41,359 --> 01:37:44,880
vision

2684
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:46,639
[Laughter]

2685
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,000
so all these things are connected yes

2686
01:37:46,639 --> 01:37:49,600
and i wouldn't have realized

2687
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,359
that we could sit here and do this

2688
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:54,560
forever we could we could i could tell

2689
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:54,559
you these comparisons forever

2690
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:58,960
but this all this connective tissue

2691
01:37:57,279 --> 01:38:00,559
bringing all these things together

2692
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,760
i wouldn't have seen it without i don't

2693
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,280
think i would have seen it without

2694
01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:06,800
jiu-jitsu

2695
01:38:03,279 --> 01:38:10,800
so jiu-jitsu to me had it had a

2696
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:12,560
incredible life impact on me

2697
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,320
not look the physical part yes

2698
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:17,520
absolutely does it

2699
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:21,198
does it keep you humble when you know

2700
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:23,840
that there's a 145 pound individual

2701
01:38:21,198 --> 01:38:24,638
that can tap you out when you're 220

2702
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:29,360
pound

2703
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:30,639
25 year old guy and there's a 135 or 140

2704
01:38:29,359 --> 01:38:33,920
pound

2705
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:34,400
you know 46 year old guy that can make

2706
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:37,440
you tap

2707
01:38:34,399 --> 01:38:38,158
out that's humbling and and what do you

2708
01:38:37,439 --> 01:38:40,000
do with that

2709
01:38:38,158 --> 01:38:41,359
do you run away from it or do you

2710
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,880
continue to pursue it

2711
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:45,039
same thing with life same thing with

2712
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:48,800
anything so jiu jitsu is

2713
01:38:45,039 --> 01:38:51,600
an incredibly powerful not just physical

2714
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:54,000
aspect but it's it's a way to understand

2715
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:56,560
it's a way of thinking

2716
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:57,679
you've also competed is there something

2717
01:38:56,560 --> 01:38:58,480
you can speak to the value of

2718
01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:02,399
competition

2719
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:05,839
obviously you've been through combat

2720
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:09,039
actual military combat is many many

2721
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:10,079
many orders of magnitude more high

2722
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:13,198
stakes

2723
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:14,000
than in us in a silly sport like jiu

2724
01:39:13,198 --> 01:39:17,359
jitsu

2725
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:19,520
nevertheless it still

2726
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:20,880
has some of the echoes of the same

2727
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:22,080
challenges

2728
01:39:20,880 --> 01:39:24,480
is there something you can speak to the

2729
01:39:22,079 --> 01:39:27,039
value of competition for you

2730
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:28,238
yep competition will reveal weaknesses

2731
01:39:27,039 --> 01:39:32,560
in your game that you

2732
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:35,279
can then go back and train to rectify

2733
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,679
so that that's very useful to sort of uh

2734
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:37,599
yeah

2735
01:39:35,679 --> 01:39:39,359
as a testing ground of course training

2736
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:42,800
can be that testing ground as well

2737
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:44,799
or um that feedback

2738
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:46,639
yeah but as you and i both know if you

2739
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,159
and i train together all the time

2740
01:39:46,639 --> 01:39:49,679
you'll in my game i'll know your game

2741
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:50,960
and even if we have five other people we

2742
01:39:49,679 --> 01:39:51,840
all kind of understand each other's

2743
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:53,118
games

2744
01:39:51,840 --> 01:39:55,360
and you're not doing something to me

2745
01:39:53,118 --> 01:39:57,198
that i don't expect so when i go

2746
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:58,479
and compete i'm good you're you know

2747
01:39:57,198 --> 01:40:00,319
this random person

2748
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:01,839
has a game that i've never seen before

2749
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:03,759
i'm and i may or may not

2750
01:40:01,840 --> 01:40:05,279
know how to deal with that game if i

2751
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:07,280
know how to deal with it great

2752
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:09,039
i get the victory maybe i don't learn as

2753
01:40:07,279 --> 01:40:09,840
much if i don't know how to deal with

2754
01:40:09,039 --> 01:40:13,359
their game

2755
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:15,600
i get the loss and i get the win

2756
01:40:13,359 --> 01:40:17,599
of learning what some weakness in my

2757
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:20,079
game is

2758
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:21,199
so you mentioned offline that uh your

2759
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:24,319
friends and you work with

2760
01:40:21,198 --> 01:40:25,439
dean lister and dean lister is one of

2761
01:40:24,319 --> 01:40:28,319
the people that

2762
01:40:25,439 --> 01:40:30,000
inspired john donahue who i've very much

2763
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:32,000
been

2764
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:34,639
i've gotten a chance to talk to quite a

2765
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:36,399
bit recently

2766
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:39,840
i don't know what you think about this

2767
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:41,839
this is not a therapy session but

2768
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,360
or maybe it is into one it's turning

2769
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:46,880
into one

2770
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:51,198
i've uh that he's a fascinating

2771
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:53,359
uh person john donahue in terms of

2772
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:56,238
creating almost the science of jiu jitsu

2773
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:59,359
to a level that i haven't seen before

2774
01:40:56,238 --> 01:41:01,198
which is systems thinking about

2775
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:04,319
like you can think about military combat

2776
01:41:01,198 --> 01:41:06,158
as tactics in a particular situation

2777
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:08,719
but then you zoom out and you want to

2778
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:09,599
create entire systems of tactics in all

2779
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:12,000
situations

2780
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:15,199
right he's very kind of wants to keep

2781
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:18,079
zooming out and creating giant systems

2782
01:41:15,198 --> 01:41:18,638
and uh which i appreciate that even

2783
01:41:18,079 --> 01:41:22,079
though the

2784
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:25,920
the task is probably impossible uh

2785
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:27,760
to do completely but there's

2786
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:30,000
something that's in terms of competition

2787
01:41:27,760 --> 01:41:30,000
that

2788
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:36,079
he kindled the fire in me that i want to

2789
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:39,520
get back out there

2790
01:41:36,079 --> 01:41:41,519
here's a particular thing that did it

2791
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:44,400
which it was very different from my

2792
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:47,760
personal journey in jiu jitsu

2793
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:49,359
which was to degree that

2794
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:50,800
uh people i worked with cared about

2795
01:41:49,359 --> 01:41:54,000
competition

2796
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,000
it was always about winning

2797
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:57,920
and uh or doing well all those kinds of

2798
01:41:56,719 --> 01:42:01,920
things

2799
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:03,840
for john it's about winning

2800
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:05,679
like winning is not it's not even the

2801
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:07,679
thing that's important

2802
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:09,840
what's most important is winning by

2803
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:13,679
submission

2804
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:16,800
is uh or dominance right

2805
01:42:13,679 --> 01:42:17,840
and uh and not just the the end it's the

2806
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,960
entire time

2807
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:22,719
competing such that the only thing that

2808
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:24,399
matters is that kind of victory

2809
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:26,079
and that's a very different level of

2810
01:42:24,399 --> 01:42:28,158
competition that's actually liberating

2811
01:42:26,079 --> 01:42:31,679
in a certain kind of sense

2812
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:34,879
i remember so much my competition

2813
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:36,158
was about kind of fear of uh not taking

2814
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,159
risks

2815
01:42:36,158 --> 01:42:39,759
you know you get up on points or you

2816
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:41,439
hold a strong position you kind of

2817
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:43,760
advance you get more points

2818
01:42:41,439 --> 01:42:45,439
maybe you chase the submission but

2819
01:42:43,760 --> 01:42:48,960
there's always a fear of risk

2820
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:50,638
and for him you embrace the risk

2821
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,118
you're not you should not be competing

2822
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:55,920
out of fear you know uh

2823
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:56,639
live and die by the sword versus uh stay

2824
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:57,760
in safety

2825
01:42:56,639 --> 01:43:00,639
i don't know if there's something to be

2826
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,560
said here well i mean this is um

2827
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,639
not you said it's novel to you it's not

2828
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:06,560
novel to me the entire

2829
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:08,159
my entire journey on jiu jitsu in jiu

2830
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:10,480
jitsu was only about

2831
01:43:08,158 --> 01:43:11,519
submission and you know as you as you

2832
01:43:10,479 --> 01:43:14,158
mentioned

2833
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:15,199
dean dean lister is my coach and my main

2834
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:18,158
training partner for

2835
01:43:15,198 --> 01:43:18,960
20 something years and if you ever watch

2836
01:43:18,158 --> 01:43:21,599
dean

2837
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:22,079
train or fight that's what he's trying

2838
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,320
to do

2839
01:43:22,079 --> 01:43:25,760
is submit as everyone that's what he's

2840
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:28,238
always done

2841
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,920
that's what he always will do he you

2842
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:31,678
know he has the highest

2843
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:33,440
i think he has impact i know he has the

2844
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:37,440
highest submission

2845
01:43:33,439 --> 01:43:41,279
victories in adcc he that's what he does

2846
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:42,879
so this is in fact as jiu-jitsu got more

2847
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:46,479
popular

2848
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:49,920
and we started seeing people competing

2849
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:51,359
to win by points that was what was novel

2850
01:43:49,920 --> 01:43:52,319
to me in the beginning now it's the

2851
01:43:51,359 --> 01:43:55,039
standard

2852
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:56,399
so it's not novel to me i i love the

2853
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:59,118
fact that

2854
01:43:56,399 --> 01:43:59,679
john donahue and all of his troops go

2855
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:01,118
out

2856
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:02,639
and they try and submit people i think

2857
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:03,920
it's awesome and i think that's what jiu

2858
01:44:02,639 --> 01:44:05,520
jitsu is

2859
01:44:03,920 --> 01:44:07,679
all right let's ask for some advice for

2860
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:09,040
white belts there's a lot of white belts

2861
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:10,719
to listen to this

2862
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:12,479
what advice would you give uh you've

2863
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:16,960
been doing jiu jitsu for many years

2864
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:18,638
in terms of uh a successful

2865
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:20,000
journey through gjso what advice would

2866
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:22,400
you give them people just starting

2867
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:23,920
out just keep training keep your ego in

2868
01:44:22,399 --> 01:44:25,198
check don't freak out try and use the

2869
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:26,239
techniques that you learn

2870
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:27,678
and all this stuff so i'm like i'm

2871
01:44:26,238 --> 01:44:28,399
saying it you know notice how i'm saying

2872
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:31,520
it yeah

2873
01:44:28,399 --> 01:44:32,719
hey tap out keep your ego check and

2874
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,600
everyone but the thing is everyone says

2875
01:44:32,719 --> 01:44:35,359
this all the time

2876
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,960
and white belts still start off by going

2877
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:39,599
completely nuts for at least

2878
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:41,118
you know three to six months of i'm not

2879
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:43,039
gonna let this guy tap me out

2880
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:44,719
and they're gonna and i'm gonna tap this

2881
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:46,079
guy out not by using technique but by

2882
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:48,079
just using strength

2883
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:49,439
and it's just a it's just inhibiting

2884
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:51,198
your learning

2885
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:52,479
so as much as you can i know i know you

2886
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:53,599
got to get it out of your system i know

2887
01:44:52,479 --> 01:44:55,118
you don't want to tap and i know you

2888
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:58,960
want to tap somebody

2889
01:44:55,118 --> 01:45:01,759
but as soon as you get get that

2890
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:04,800
off your chest then try and try and

2891
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:06,560
relax and try and learn the techniques

2892
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,639
it's perhaps counter-intuitive it never

2893
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:10,000
was to me but it's counter-intuitive

2894
01:45:08,639 --> 01:45:12,079
that to uh

2895
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:14,238
to start on the journey of really sort

2896
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:17,359
of mastering jiu-jitsu whatever or

2897
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:18,559
improving is you have to relax

2898
01:45:17,359 --> 01:45:20,000
and that seems to be a very

2899
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:21,840
counterintuitive lesson i learned that

2900
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:24,319
early on with uh

2901
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:26,159
that was thanks to the russian system i

2902
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:27,039
played piano and like music but

2903
01:45:26,158 --> 01:45:29,679
basically actually

2904
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:31,198
this is true for basically any sport

2905
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:33,760
that includes a human body

2906
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:35,198
is like relaxing is the way you you

2907
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:37,199
start learning stuff you have to

2908
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:38,559
learn you have to literally and most

2909
01:45:37,198 --> 01:45:39,599
people don't seem to understand this

2910
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,520
it's like

2911
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:44,079
you have to learn what it means for the

2912
01:45:41,520 --> 01:45:46,560
human body to relax

2913
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:48,479
like i guess you have to have enough

2914
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:49,920
knowledge of all the muscles involved

2915
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:51,678
to know what it means to relax those

2916
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,560
muscles so for piano you have to

2917
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:54,719
understand

2918
01:45:52,560 --> 01:45:55,600
what it means to relax your wrists and

2919
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:58,719
your fingers

2920
01:45:55,600 --> 01:46:01,360
in order to learn how to move them

2921
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:02,719
like if there's tenseness in the fingers

2922
01:46:01,359 --> 01:46:06,639
you're not going to

2923
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:11,279
like you have to learn how to try hard

2924
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:13,118
while relaxed the i guess the beginner

2925
01:46:11,279 --> 01:46:14,639
if you don't internalize this lesson

2926
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:18,079
we'll try hard by

2927
01:46:14,639 --> 01:46:19,600
uh tensing up hard and like trying hard

2928
01:46:18,079 --> 01:46:21,679
tensing up more

2929
01:46:19,600 --> 01:46:22,960
as opposed to relaxing more and that

2930
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:26,560
lesson

2931
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:28,239
cannot be conveyed through words i guess

2932
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:30,639
i've had the great fortune of having

2933
01:46:28,238 --> 01:46:31,439
dictatorial teachers as they do in

2934
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:34,000
russia for

2935
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:35,118
uh for piano and so on we get like hit

2936
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:37,118
if

2937
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:39,759
if you don't learn to relax which is a

2938
01:46:37,118 --> 01:46:41,439
counterintuitive notion but it works

2939
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:43,199
yeah this brings me to one of my

2940
01:46:41,439 --> 01:46:44,960
favorite pieces of coaching advice that

2941
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:46,719
i will tell white belts while they're

2942
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:49,840
struggling on the mat i'll tell them to

2943
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:53,039
relax harder

2944
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:56,319
okay uh that's

2945
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:59,439
beautiful for somebody

2946
01:46:56,319 --> 01:47:01,519
who studied war who participated in war

2947
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:03,118
what do you think is the best martial

2948
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:08,000
arts

2949
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:11,039
for um let's call it self-defense

2950
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,359
hand-to-hand combat outside the

2951
01:47:11,039 --> 01:47:17,198
constraints of sport

2952
01:47:13,359 --> 01:47:24,238
so it's not one answer the answer to me

2953
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:27,599
is jiu-jitsu boxing wrestling muay thai

2954
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:29,759
judo [ __ ] and on down the list

2955
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:31,679
i definitely start with jiu jitsu the

2956
01:47:29,760 --> 01:47:34,639
reason i start with jiu jitsu is because

2957
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:37,760
in a self-defense situation

2958
01:47:34,639 --> 01:47:40,480
if you are a big monster human

2959
01:47:37,760 --> 01:47:41,440
and you want to fight me and you square

2960
01:47:40,479 --> 01:47:45,439
off with me

2961
01:47:41,439 --> 01:47:46,638
guess what i'm going to do run away

2962
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:49,039
because i don't want i don't want to get

2963
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:52,079
involved even if i see

2964
01:47:49,039 --> 01:47:53,439
skinny little lex out on the street and

2965
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:54,479
you start yelling at me and saying you

2966
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:54,879
want to fight me i don't want to fight

2967
01:47:54,479 --> 01:47:56,879
you

2968
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:57,920
i don't it doesn't matter i don't care

2969
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,920
if i can beat you or not

2970
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:01,600
what if you stab me what if you sue me

2971
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:02,399
after i get done throwing you onto the

2972
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:04,079
concrete

2973
01:48:02,399 --> 01:48:06,559
there's a million bad things that can

2974
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:09,600
happen and almost nothing good

2975
01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:11,600
so for self-defense my first

2976
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:13,440
self-defense is my feet to get away from

2977
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:15,520
you

2978
01:48:13,439 --> 01:48:16,879
and if you square off to punch me i can

2979
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:18,719
run away from you if you

2980
01:48:16,880 --> 01:48:20,560
square off to kick me i can run away

2981
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:21,840
from you if you push me i can run away

2982
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:24,159
from you

2983
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:25,600
so great i don't need to know how to box

2984
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:28,799
to run away from you

2985
01:48:25,600 --> 01:48:30,480
where this all changes is when you grab

2986
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,480
me

2987
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:33,519
and now i don't have the option to run

2988
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:35,599
away anymore

2989
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:36,639
now i actually have to know how to get

2990
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,199
away from

2991
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:41,039
your grip and that's where jiu-jitsu

2992
01:48:39,198 --> 01:48:42,799
comes into play

2993
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:44,800
so especially if you get me on the

2994
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:46,880
ground if you if you grab me

2995
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:48,239
and get me on the ground now i need to

2996
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:49,760
know how to get

2997
01:48:48,238 --> 01:48:52,479
you off of me and get up and get away

2998
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:55,039
from you so i can run away

2999
01:48:52,479 --> 01:48:57,039
so that's why i say start with jiu jitsu

3000
01:48:55,039 --> 01:49:00,719
and and from there

3001
01:48:57,039 --> 01:49:03,840
boxing wrestling judo [ __ ]

3002
01:49:00,719 --> 01:49:05,118
muay thai yeah there's uh there's cert

3003
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:08,319
in the standing position

3004
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:09,920
i mean i'm a judo person as well and

3005
01:49:08,319 --> 01:49:11,679
the judo is very limited in their

3006
01:49:09,920 --> 01:49:13,279
understanding the full grappling

3007
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:15,359
spectrum

3008
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:17,279
even though they do all the things on

3009
01:49:15,359 --> 01:49:19,359
the ground as well but uh

3010
01:49:17,279 --> 01:49:20,880
it's so focused on the feet but

3011
01:49:19,359 --> 01:49:22,639
nevertheless it's important to

3012
01:49:20,880 --> 01:49:25,920
understand

3013
01:49:22,639 --> 01:49:28,800
the thing that judo has

3014
01:49:25,920 --> 01:49:30,719
as a sport that's good to practice that

3015
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:34,639
jiu jitsu doesn't

3016
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:36,880
is uh not just the

3017
01:49:34,639 --> 01:49:38,400
gra the skill of grappling on the feet

3018
01:49:36,880 --> 01:49:42,000
but the skill of

3019
01:49:38,399 --> 01:49:43,839
explosive aggression that

3020
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,599
sometimes you just is more about in

3021
01:49:43,840 --> 01:49:46,480
terms of tactics it's more about

3022
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:49,039
patience

3023
01:49:46,479 --> 01:49:51,678
and it depends how you practice it but

3024
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:54,238
because so much is uh about control

3025
01:49:51,679 --> 01:49:55,440
and uh technique that uh sometimes you

3026
01:49:54,238 --> 01:49:58,399
don't get to practice

3027
01:49:55,439 --> 01:50:00,638
like aggression explosive aggression and

3028
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:03,439
judo is so much about

3029
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:04,560
uh aggression implemented in such a way

3030
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:07,039
that the

3031
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:08,960
demonstration of power is effortless

3032
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:10,000
right that's the beauty of jiu-jitsu

3033
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:11,840
yeah and same thing with wrestling

3034
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,279
wrestling also has a high level of

3035
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,199
intensity and aggression as well

3036
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:16,639
yes yeah so that's where that's where i

3037
01:50:15,198 --> 01:50:20,079
agree judo

3038
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:23,840
and wrestling absolutely awesome

3039
01:50:20,079 --> 01:50:24,960
get some and striking boxing muay thai

3040
01:50:23,840 --> 01:50:27,679
yeah you know like

3041
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:28,960
the you should train all these things

3042
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:31,760
are there books

3043
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:34,560
and movies in your life long ago

3044
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:38,000
recently that had a big impact on you

3045
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:41,280
yeah the main one is about face which

3046
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:42,639
is sitting right here there you go

3047
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:45,679
this is written by colonel david

3048
01:50:42,639 --> 01:50:47,760
hackworth it's the

3049
01:50:45,679 --> 01:50:50,000
book that really had a massive impact on

3050
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,560
me from a leadership perspective

3051
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:54,158
and i ended up i talked about it enough

3052
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,920
that it started kind of coming back

3053
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:57,679
and started selling well and they

3054
01:50:55,920 --> 01:50:58,158
contacted me and i wrote a forward for

3055
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:02,239
it

3056
01:50:58,158 --> 01:51:04,719
so that book had a huge impact on me and

3057
01:51:02,238 --> 01:51:05,678
i still when i read it i still get

3058
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:08,000
lessons out of it

3059
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:09,039
just about every time this is a vietnam

3060
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:12,560
war

3061
01:51:09,039 --> 01:51:14,479
and korea and korea and he

3062
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:15,840
got in towards the end of right at the

3063
01:51:14,479 --> 01:51:18,319
end of world war ii

3064
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:19,360
so he was kind of raised by the the

3065
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:21,679
soldiers that fought

3066
01:51:19,359 --> 01:51:23,759
in world war ii and then he went to

3067
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:27,039
korea and then he went to vietnam

3068
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:30,000
an exceptional warrior a soldier soldier

3069
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:35,279
if you can give a little inkling what

3070
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:39,118
made him a soldier soldier

3071
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:42,639
so i he died in 2005.

3072
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:46,000
so i never got to meet him and

3073
01:51:42,639 --> 01:51:46,880
i i had a guy on my podcast who worked

3074
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:49,920
for him

3075
01:51:46,880 --> 01:51:53,760
in vietnam a guy named general

3076
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:57,118
james mukayama and luckily his son

3077
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:59,039
had reached out to me and said

3078
01:51:57,118 --> 01:52:00,639
i think you're talking about my dad

3079
01:51:59,039 --> 01:52:01,198
because i read some passage in there

3080
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:03,840
that

3081
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:05,519
that jim mukayama was young cap young

3082
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:06,400
captain jim mukayam a company commander

3083
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:08,400
in vietnam

3084
01:52:06,399 --> 01:52:09,920
he said i think you're talking about my

3085
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:11,519
dad

3086
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:13,440
would you want to talk to him and i said

3087
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,639
absolutely well here's the thing that i

3088
01:52:13,439 --> 01:52:16,079
didn't really understand and you read

3089
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:17,359
one quote but there's all these quotes

3090
01:52:16,079 --> 01:52:19,760
in that book

3091
01:52:17,359 --> 01:52:20,880
that talk about how great hackworth was

3092
01:52:19,760 --> 01:52:22,719
and

3093
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:24,319
what an incredible leader he was and how

3094
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:25,039
he was the best combat leader anyone had

3095
01:52:24,319 --> 01:52:26,719
ever seen and

3096
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:28,000
all these just really complementary

3097
01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:29,439
things that are said by a bunch of

3098
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,840
different people

3099
01:52:29,439 --> 01:52:33,279
and when you read the book you're

3100
01:52:31,840 --> 01:52:35,760
reading this guy's account of what he

3101
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:35,759
went through

3102
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:41,760
but i never really knew if that was all

3103
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:43,279
true or did he just cherry-pick his

3104
01:52:41,760 --> 01:52:45,599
friends

3105
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:48,719
quotes about him and cherry picked the

3106
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:50,239
stories that he wanted to tell

3107
01:52:48,719 --> 01:52:51,840
and so it was very interesting for me

3108
01:52:50,238 --> 01:52:53,678
when i met mukayam

3109
01:52:51,840 --> 01:52:56,000
general mukayama who he became a general

3110
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:58,158
eventually when i met him

3111
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,439
and we were talking about his life and i

3112
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:00,799
was very curious and i was a little bit

3113
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:01,759
nervous going into this interview

3114
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,639
because i was thinking

3115
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:06,000
maybe my hero my mentor this guy that

3116
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:08,800
i've never met before

3117
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,439
maybe he's just an arrogant jerk that

3118
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:12,719
talked

3119
01:53:09,439 --> 01:53:15,118
talked himself up in this book so i'm

3120
01:53:12,719 --> 01:53:17,279
sitting down with with general mukuyama

3121
01:53:15,118 --> 01:53:18,399
and i finally got to the part where he's

3122
01:53:17,279 --> 01:53:22,399
meeting

3123
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:25,759
hackworth for the first time and

3124
01:53:22,399 --> 01:53:26,879
i said did you know did you know who

3125
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:30,079
hackworth was

3126
01:53:26,880 --> 01:53:31,599
when he showed up so he was mook they

3127
01:53:30,079 --> 01:53:35,039
call him mook mook was the

3128
01:53:31,599 --> 01:53:38,000
was the like the adjutant to the

3129
01:53:35,039 --> 01:53:39,679
to the general that that was going to

3130
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,198
that hackworth was gonna be working for

3131
01:53:39,679 --> 01:53:42,880
so when hackworth comes into the office

3132
01:53:41,198 --> 01:53:46,238
the first person he meets is this guy

3133
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:47,679
this guy cap mokoyama and

3134
01:53:46,238 --> 01:53:50,238
so hackworth walks in and i said when

3135
01:53:47,679 --> 01:53:51,679
hackworth walked in did you know who he

3136
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:54,238
was

3137
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:55,199
and mukayama says everybody knew who he

3138
01:53:54,238 --> 01:53:58,158
was

3139
01:53:55,198 --> 01:53:59,919
mr infantry and so he ended up

3140
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:01,519
explaining that

3141
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:03,199
everything that is written in there

3142
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:08,639
about hackworth

3143
01:54:03,198 --> 01:54:10,719
they they just loved him they adored him

3144
01:54:08,639 --> 01:54:12,000
up the chain of command it turned out a

3145
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:13,279
little bit different and

3146
01:54:12,000 --> 01:54:14,639
you know the title of the book is about

3147
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:15,519
face and if you're familiar with

3148
01:54:14,639 --> 01:54:17,599
familiar with

3149
01:54:15,520 --> 01:54:19,119
military drill about faces when you turn

3150
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:22,000
around 180 degrees

3151
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:24,238
and at the end of the vietnam war

3152
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:26,639
towards the end of the vietnam war

3153
01:54:24,238 --> 01:54:27,598
he was so disgusted with the way that

3154
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:29,359
the war was being

3155
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:31,039
fought he was so disgusted with the

3156
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:31,920
decisions that were being made by the

3157
01:54:31,039 --> 01:54:33,359
leadership

3158
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,199
that he did an interview he was the

3159
01:54:33,359 --> 01:54:38,158
first colonel

3160
01:54:35,198 --> 01:54:39,039
first senior officer to do an interview

3161
01:54:38,158 --> 01:54:40,559
that

3162
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:41,920
spoke out against the war that was

3163
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:43,119
happening and this is while he's in

3164
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:47,039
vietnam by the way

3165
01:54:43,118 --> 01:54:50,000
so he got drummed out of the army and he

3166
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:50,560
was forced to retire and that was that

3167
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:52,719
so

3168
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:54,080
there's an element of rebelliousness to

3169
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:56,319
him and

3170
01:54:54,079 --> 01:54:58,158
you know when you talk to me about are

3171
01:54:56,319 --> 01:55:00,399
are there times when

3172
01:54:58,158 --> 01:55:01,839
the leader is making the leadership this

3173
01:55:00,399 --> 01:55:03,359
absolute senior leadership

3174
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:04,880
the civilian leadership is doing the

3175
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:07,039
wrong things yes

3176
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:07,920
and there's times when people speak out

3177
01:55:07,039 --> 01:55:09,439
against it

3178
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:11,520
and there's an argument for against that

3179
01:55:09,439 --> 01:55:13,919
too even even with hackworth

3180
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:15,440
you know did he when you get when you

3181
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:18,319
quit your job or you do something that

3182
01:55:15,439 --> 01:55:19,519
gets you fired which is what he did

3183
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:22,319
you immediately give up all your

3184
01:55:19,520 --> 01:55:24,159
influence over what's happening

3185
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:25,439
so they get another they get another

3186
01:55:24,158 --> 01:55:26,638
battalion commander to take his place

3187
01:55:25,439 --> 01:55:28,399
they get another colonel to step in and

3188
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:30,000
take his place that's what they do

3189
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:31,519
and now he can't help anymore he can't

3190
01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:34,800
help his troops

3191
01:55:31,520 --> 01:55:38,239
but at that point in the war he loved

3192
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:42,400
his men so much

3193
01:55:38,238 --> 01:55:45,039
that he was sickened with the

3194
01:55:42,399 --> 01:55:46,879
situation on the ground and he and he

3195
01:55:45,039 --> 01:55:50,000
spoke out about it

3196
01:55:46,880 --> 01:55:52,480
so that book had a huge impact on me and

3197
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:54,800
like i said i still i still read it all

3198
01:55:52,479 --> 01:55:57,439
the time i reread it all the time

3199
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:58,639
and i always take lessons from it let me

3200
01:55:57,439 --> 01:56:00,079
ask you about love

3201
01:55:58,639 --> 01:56:03,199
this is not usually associated with

3202
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:05,439
giaco but uh what role does love

3203
01:56:03,198 --> 01:56:06,238
in terms of uh friendship in terms of

3204
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:08,719
family

3205
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:10,799
play in a successful life in life in

3206
01:56:08,719 --> 01:56:12,840
general

3207
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,320
again this is putting other people above

3208
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:15,520
yourself

3209
01:56:14,319 --> 01:56:18,079
do you see that as love that's

3210
01:56:15,520 --> 01:56:22,480
ultimately the implementation of love

3211
01:56:18,079 --> 01:56:25,519
i would say yes jocko i've been a

3212
01:56:22,479 --> 01:56:27,359
huge fan of yours you're somebody who

3213
