00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,559
constantine bategan

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,679
planetary astrophysicist at caltech

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:10,000
interested in

5
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,679
among other things the search for the

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,400
distant the mysterious

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,640
planet nine in the outer regions of our

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,440
solar system quick mention of our

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
sponsors

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,960
squarespace literati on it and

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,960
and i check them out in the description

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,800
to support this podcast

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,960
as a side note let me say that our

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,800
little sun is orbited by

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
not just a few planets in the planetary

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,280
region but trillions of

17
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,840
objects in the kuiper belt and the oort

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,719
cloud that extends over three

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,160
light years out this to me is amazing

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,039
since proxima centauri

21
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:46,640
the closest star to our sun is only 4.2

22
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,800
light years away

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,000
and all of it is mostly covered in

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,599
darkness

25
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,439
when i get a chance to go out swimming

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,399
in the ocean far from the shore

27
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:58,640
i'm sometimes overcome by the terrifying

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,520
and the exciting feeling of not knowing

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,000
what's there

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,000
in the deep darkness that's how i feel

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,879
about the edge of our solar system

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,079
one day i hope humans will travel there

33
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,839
or at the very least

34
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,079
ai systems that carry the flame of human

35
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,400
consciousness

36
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,679
this is the lex friedman podcast and

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,880
here's my conversation

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,920
with constantine bategan

39
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:25,199
what is planet nine planet nine

40
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,118
is an object that we believe

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,920
lives in the solar system beyond the

42
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:33,040
orbit of neptune it orbits the sun

43
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,240
with a period of about 10 000 years

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,799
and uh is about five earth masses

45
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:40,158
so that's a hypothesized object there's

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,920
some evidence

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,920
uh for this kind of object there's a

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,879
bunch of different explanations

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
can you give like an overview of the

50
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:49,920
planets in our solar system how many are

51
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,720
there

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,600
what do we know and not know about them

53
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,438
at a high level

54
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:57,519
all right that sounds like a good plan

55
00:01:55,438 --> 00:02:00,398
so look the solar system

56
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,000
basically is comprised of two parts the

57
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,280
inner and the outer solar system

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,399
the inner solar system has the planets

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,840
mercury venus

60
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:13,199
earth and mars now mercury is about

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,840
40 percent of the orbital separation

62
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,719
of where the earth is is closer to the

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,680
sun venus

64
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:25,840
about 70 percent uh then mars is about

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,120
160 further away from the sun than is

66
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,319
the earth

67
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,439
these planets that we uh one of them

68
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,560
we occupy right are pretty small okay

69
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,959
they're

70
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,479
too leading order sort of heavily

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,680
overgrown asteroids

72
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:44,639
if you will um and this is

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
this becomes evident when you move out

74
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,799
further

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,959
in the solar system and encounter

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,680
jupiter which is 316

77
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:56,400
earth masses right 10 times the size

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,200
you know and saturn is another huge one

79
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,158
90 earth masses at about 10 times

80
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:03,679
uh the separation from the sun this is

81
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,560
the earth and then you have uranus and

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,080
neptune

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,120
at 20 and 30 respectively for a long

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,239
time

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,280
that is where the kind of massive

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,840
part of the solar system ended

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,560
but what we've learned in the last 30

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,920
years

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,120
is that beyond neptune there's this

90
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:27,598
expansive field of icy debris a second

91
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,319
icy asteroid belt in the solar system a

92
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,439
lot of people have

93
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:32,639
heard of the asteroid belt which lives

94
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,280
be between

95
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,759
mars and jupiter right like that's a

96
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,080
pretty common thing that people like to

97
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,919
imagine and draw on lunch boxes and

98
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,239
stuff but beyond neptune

99
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,759
there's a much more massive much more

100
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,200
radially

101
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,598
expansive field of debris pluto by the

102
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:52,958
way

103
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,798
it belongs to that second

104
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,400
you know icy asteroid belt which we call

105
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,438
the kuiper belt it's just a big

106
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,080
object within that population of bodies

107
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,359
oh pluto

108
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,480
the planet pluto the the dwarf planet

109
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,879
the former planet

110
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,840
you know why is pluto not a planet

111
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,479
anymore

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
i mean it's tiny were you used to size

113
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:15,039
matters when it comes to planets

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,680
100 100 it's a actually a fascinating

115
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,279
story

116
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,358
when pluto was discovered in 1930

117
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,439
the the reason it was discovered in the

118
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,680
first place because astronomers at the

119
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,040
time were looking for a seven earth mass

120
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,120
planet

121
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,840
somewhere beyond neptune it was

122
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,000
hypothesized that such an object exists

123
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:35,039
when they found something they

124
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,360
interpreted that

125
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,000
as a seven earth mass planet and

126
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,080
immediately revised its mass downward

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,839
because they couldn't resolve the object

128
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,359
with the telescope so it looked like a

129
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:48,079
just a point mass you know

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,360
star rather than a physical disk they

131
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:50,240
said well maybe it's not seven maybe

132
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,280
it's one

133
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,960
right and then so over the next um you

134
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,679
know i guess 40 years

135
00:04:54,959 --> 00:05:00,159
pluto's mass kept getting revised down

136
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,759
downwards downwards downwards until

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,240
uh it was realized that's like 500 times

138
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,439
less massive than the earth i mean like

139
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,038
pluto's

140
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:14,000
surface area is almost perfectly equal

141
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:15,519
to the surface area of russia actually

142
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
and you know russia is big but it's not

143
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,519
a planet

144
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,199
well i mean actually we can we can touch

145
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,079
more on that that's that's another

146
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,360
discussion

147
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:27,198
uh so in some sense earlier in the

148
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
century pluto represented

149
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,120
kind of our ignorance about the edges of

150
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,439
the solar system

151
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,439
and perhaps planet nine is the thing

152
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:39,439
that represents our ignorance

153
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:41,038
about now the modern set of ignorances

154
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,800
about the edges of our solar system

155
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:43,120
that's a good way to put it by the way

156
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,879
just

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,879
imagining this belt of astero of debris

158
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,240
at the edge of our solar system is

159
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:51,680
incredible

160
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,680
can you talk about it a little bit what

161
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,800
is the kuiper belt and

162
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,439
what it what is the oort cloud yeah

163
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,600
okay so look the simple way to think

164
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:04,399
about it is that if you imagine

165
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,039
you know neptune's orbit like a circle

166
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,638
right

167
00:06:05,038 --> 00:06:10,318
kind of uh maybe a factor of one and a

168
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,000
half 1.3

169
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:16,160
uh times bigger uh on a radius of

170
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,038
1.3 times bigger you've got a whole

171
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,319
collection of icy objects most of these

172
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,680
objects

173
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,400
are sort of the size of austin you know

174
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,199
maybe maybe a little bit smaller if you

175
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:31,279
then

176
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:34,639
zoom out right and

177
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,399
explore the orbits of the most long

178
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
period kuiper belt object these are the

179
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:40,959
things that have the

180
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:43,038
biggest orbits and take the longest time

181
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,918
to go around the sun

182
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,038
then what you find is that beyond a

183
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:48,959
critical

184
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,519
orbit size beyond a critical orbit

185
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:54,239
period which is about 4 000 years

186
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,918
you start to see weird structure like

187
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,280
all the orbits

188
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:01,598
sort of point into one direction and

189
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,399
all the orbits are kind of tilted in the

190
00:07:01,598 --> 00:07:05,199
same

191
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,758
way by about 20 degrees with respect to

192
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,759
sun this is particularly pronounced

193
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,960
in orbits that are not heavily affected

194
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,960
by neptune

195
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,719
so there you start to see this weird

196
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,918
dichotomy where there are

197
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,720
objects which are stable which are which

198
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,279
neptune

199
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,120
does not mess with gravitationally and

200
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,559
unstable objects the unstable objects

201
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,639
are basically all over the place

202
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,598
because they're being you know kicked

203
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,918
around by neptune the stable

204
00:07:29,598 --> 00:07:33,199
orbits show this remarkable pattern of

205
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,159
clustering

206
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,240
we back i guess five years ago

207
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:41,120
interpreted this pattern of clustering

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,478
as a gravitational one-way sign the

209
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
existence of

210
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,719
a planet in a distant planet right

211
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,000
something that is shepherding and

212
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,599
confining

213
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:54,319
these orbits together of course

214
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:54,959
right you have to have some skepticism

215
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,879
when you're

216
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,719
when you're talking about these things

217
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,720
you have to ask the question of okay how

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,560
statistically significant

219
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,759
is this clustering and there are many

220
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,560
authors that

221
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
have indeed called that into question we

222
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
have done

223
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,439
our own analyses and basically just like

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,839
with all statistics where

225
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,439
you know there's kind of like you know

226
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:18,478
multiple ways

227
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:21,199
to uh do the exercise

228
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,478
you can either ask the question if i

229
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,439
have a telescope

230
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:26,000
that has you know surveyed this part of

231
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:27,360
the sky

232
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,079
what are the chances that i would

233
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,959
discover this clustering

234
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,079
that basically tells you that you have

235
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,559
zero confidence

236
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,360
right like that's not that does not give

237
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,679
you

238
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,440
a confident answer one way or another

239
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,319
another way to do the statistics which

240
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,279
is what we

241
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,320
prefer to do is to take to say we have a

242
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,679
whole

243
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,080
night sky of discoveries in the kuiper

244
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:53,278
belt

245
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,000
right and if we have some object over

246
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:56,240
there

247
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,519
which has right tension and declination

248
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,000
which is a way to say it's

249
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,720
there on the sky and it has some

250
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,639
brightness

251
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,240
that means somebody looked over there

252
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,799
and discovered an object

253
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,000
of was able to discover an object of

254
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,958
that brightness or

255
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,320
brighter through that analysis you can

256
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:14,559
construct a whole map

257
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,560
on the sky of kind of where all of the

258
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,639
surveys that have ever been done

259
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:20,879
have collectively looked so if you do

260
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:24,080
the exercise this way

261
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:26,399
the false alarm probability of

262
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,680
the clustering on which the planet nine

263
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,679
hypothesis is built is about 0.4

264
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,479
wow okay so there's a million questions

265
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:36,159
here one when you say bright objects

266
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
why are they bright are we talking about

267
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,600
actual objects within the kuiper belt or

268
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,759
the stuff we see through the kupper belt

269
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,040
this is the actual stuff we see in the

270
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:44,879
kuiper belt the way

271
00:09:43,039 --> 00:09:46,240
you go about discovering kuiper belt

272
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,519
objects pretty easy

273
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,080
i mean it's easy in theory right hard in

274
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,200
practice

275
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,000
yeah all you do is you take snapshots of

276
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,240
the sky

277
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,120
right choose that direction say and take

278
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,680
you know

279
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,639
the high exposure snapshot then you wait

280
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,239
a night

281
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:04,319
and you do it again and then you wait

282
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,639
another night and you do it again

283
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,399
objects that are just random stars in

284
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,399
the galaxy don't move

285
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,759
on the sky whereas objects in the solar

286
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,320
system will slowly move

287
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,919
this is no different than if you're

288
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,000
driving down the freeway

289
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,919
it looks like you know trees are going

290
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,278
by you faster than the clouds right this

291
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,519
is parallax

292
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,320
that's it it's just they're reflecting

293
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,399
light off

294
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,079
of the sun and it's going back and

295
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,720
hitting this there's a little bit of a

296
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:30,159
glimmer

297
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
from the different objects that you can

298
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:33,360
see based on the reflection from the sun

299
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:35,039
so like

300
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,200
there's actual light yeah it's not

301
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:39,679
darkness that's right these are just

302
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,600
big icicles basically that are just

303
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:44,799
reflecting sunlight back at you

304
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,480
it's then easy to understand why it's so

305
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:48,639
hard to discover them because

306
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,200
light has to travel to you know

307
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:54,000
something like 40 times the distance

308
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,079
um between the earth and the sun and

309
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,958
then get reflected back was it like an

310
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:58,799
hour

311
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,078
travel or yeah that's right that's

312
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:02,399
something like that because the

313
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,679
the earth to the sun is eight minutes i

314
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:06,399
believe um

315
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:06,879
and so something you know yeah yeah in

316
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,320
that

317
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,240
in that order magnitude so that's

318
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,399
interesting so you have to

319
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,480
like account for all of that and then

320
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,639
there's this huge amount of

321
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,000
data pixels that are coming from the

322
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,240
pictures

323
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,200
and you have to uh integrate all that

324
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,560
together

325
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,600
to paint a sort of like a high estimate

326
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:27,039
of the different objects

327
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,879
can you track them can you be like

328
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:32,159
that's bob like can you like

329
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:35,360
yes exactly in fact uh one of them is

330
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,399
is named joe biden i mean i'm not like

331
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,200
this is not even a joke

332
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,759
right is there a trump one or no no no

333
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,759
no

334
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,039
i don't know i haven't checked for for

335
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:46,000
for that but

336
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,439
uh like the way it works is if you

337
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,839
discover one

338
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,880
you right away get a license plate for

339
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,519
it okay

340
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,919
so like the first four numbers is the

341
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,639
first

342
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,838
year that this object has appeared on

343
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,120
you know

344
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:04,399
in the data set if you will and then um

345
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,879
there's like this code that follows it

346
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,759
which basically tells you where in the

347
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,559
sky it is

348
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:12,639
right so one of the really interesting

349
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,479
kuiper belt objects which is very much

350
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,959
part of the planet 9 story is called

351
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,440
vp113

352
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,159
because joe biden was vice president at

353
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,800
the time

354
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:27,199
you know got nicknamed biden

355
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:28,240
vp113 said yeah you got nickname button

356
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,200
beautiful

357
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,159
what's the fingerprint for any

358
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
particular

359
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,759
object like how do you know it's the

360
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,360
same one okay just kind of like

361
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:38,879
yeah from night to night you take a

362
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,519
picture how do you know it's the same

363
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,679
object

364
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:44,078
yeah so the way you know is it appears

365
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,319
in almost exactly the same part of the

366
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:48,719
sky except for the move but it moves but

367
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,920
this is why actually you need at least

368
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,440
three nights

369
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,599
because oftentimes asteroids

370
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,279
which are much closer to the earth like

371
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,720
will um

372
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,799
appear to move only

373
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,480
slightly but then on the third night

374
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,278
will move away so that third knight

375
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,560
is really there to detect acceleration

376
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,720
now

377
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,638
the the thing that i didn't really

378
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,040
realize until

379
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,639
you know i started observing together

380
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:17,759
with my partner in crime and all this

381
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,278
mike brown

382
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:23,120
is just the fact that for the first year

383
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:25,120
when you make these detections

384
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,120
the only thing you really know is

385
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,839
confidence is where it is on the night

386
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,720
sky

387
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,839
and how far away it is okay that's it

388
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:36,160
you don't know anything about the orbit

389
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,800
because over three days the object just

390
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:41,120
moves so little right the that whole

391
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,439
motion on the sky is entirely coming

392
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,600
from

393
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,639
motion of the earth right so the earth

394
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,560
is kind of the car

395
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,320
the object is the tree and you see it

396
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,198
moving so then

397
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,800
to get some confident information about

398
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:53,359
what its orbit looks like you have to

399
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,159
come back

400
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,639
a year later um and then measure it

401
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,240
again

402
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,240
interesting to do three nights then come

403
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,120
back a year later and do another three

404
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,879
nights

405
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,320
so you get the velocity the acceleration

406
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,120
from the three nights and then you have

407
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,519
the

408
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,159
maybe the additional the additional

409
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,000
formation

410
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,360
because an orbit is basically described

411
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,198
by six parameters

412
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,278
so you at least need six independent

413
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:18,958
points but in reality you need

414
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:20,958
many more observations to to really

415
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:22,399
pin down the orbit well and from that

416
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:24,078
you're able to construct for that one

417
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,559
particular object in orbit and then

418
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:27,278
there's

419
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,599
of course like how many objects are

420
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,198
there

421
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:34,320
there's like four-ish thousand now

422
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:36,240
but like the

423
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,440
in the future that could be like

424
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,159
millions

425
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,839
oh sure oh sure so in fact these things

426
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,159
are hard to predict but there's a

427
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,040
new observatory called the vera rubin

428
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,198
observatory which is coming online

429
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:50,319
maybe next year i mean with covet these

430
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,559
things are

431
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,480
a little bit more uncertain but they've

432
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:58,399
actually been making great progress

433
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:01,199
uh with construction and so that

434
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,480
uh telescope is gonna sort of scan the

435
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,278
night sky

436
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,680
uh every day automatically and it's just

437
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,720
it's such an efficient survey that it

438
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:12,719
might uh increase the census

439
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,240
of the distant kuiper belt the things

440
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,879
that i'm interested in

441
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,919
by a factor of 100 i mean that would be

442
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,799
that would be really cool

443
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:21,599
and yeah that's a that's an incredible

444
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,039
uh

445
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,399
maybe i mean they might just find planet

446
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:28,078
nine

447
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,679
i mean that's like almost like literally

448
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,120
pictures like visually

449
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,039
i mean sure yeah like the first

450
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,519
detection you make all you know is where

451
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:38,078
it is in the sky and how far away it is

452
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,720
if something is you know 500 times away

453
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:40,719
from the sun

454
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,320
as far away from the sun as is the earth

455
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,399
you know that's planet nine that's when

456
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,000
the story concludes

457
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,679
and then you can study it right now you

458
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,600
can study yeah by the way

459
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,599
i'm going to use that as like i don't

460
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,079
know a pickup line or a dating strategy

461
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,440
like see the person for three days and

462
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,559
then don't see them at all and then see

463
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,040
them again in

464
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:00,159
in a year to determine the orbit and

465
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,360
over time

466
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:05,600
you figure out if sort of uh

467
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,759
from a cosmic perspective this this

468
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,759
whole thing

469
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,199
i have no dating advice to give i was

470
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,600
good i was going to use this as a

471
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:16,319
metaphor to uh to somehow

472
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,920
uh map it on to the human condition okay

473
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
you mentioned the kuiper belt what's the

474
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,078
oor cloud

475
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:25,278
if you look at the neptune orbit as uh

476
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,758
one then the kuiper bell is like 1.3 out

477
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:27,600
there

478
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,800
and then we get farther and farther into

479
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,959
the darkness what

480
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:32,240
so okay you've got the kind of main

481
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,278
kuiper belt was about

482
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,839
say 1.3 1.5

483
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,039
um then you have something called the

484
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,880
scattered disc

485
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,958
which is kind of an extension of the

486
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:47,198
kuiper belt it's a bunch of these

487
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:49,119
long very elliptical orbits that hug

488
00:16:47,198 --> 00:16:50,479
the orbit of neptune but come out very

489
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,839
far so

490
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:56,480
that the scattered disc

491
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,880
with the current senses like the some of

492
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,079
the

493
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:03,278
longest orbits we know of

494
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:06,720
um have a

495
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,880
semi-major axis so half the orbit length

496
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,720
roughly speaking of about a thousand

497
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,679
thousand times the distance between the

498
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:15,279
earth and the sun

499
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:18,319
wow now if you keep moving out okay

500
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:21,279
eventually once you're sort of you know

501
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:23,359
ten thousand to a hundred thousand

502
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:26,160
roughly that's where the oort cloud is

503
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,519
now the oort cloud is a distinct

504
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,600
population of

505
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:31,200
icy bodies and it's distinct from the

506
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,558
kuiper belt it's in fact it's so

507
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,240
expansive

508
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:39,519
that it ends roughly halfway between

509
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,480
us and the next star um it's it's edge

510
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,759
is just

511
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,038
dictated by to what extent does the

512
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:47,599
solar gravity reach

513
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,119
solar gravity reaches that far yeah so

514
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:52,319
it has to

515
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,599
wow yeah so in fact

516
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,678
imagining this is a little bit

517
00:17:53,599 --> 00:18:01,119
overwhelming so there's like a giant

518
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:04,320
like vast

519
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,678
icy rock thingy it's like a sphere

520
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,678
it's like you know it's like it's an

521
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,600
almost spherical structure

522
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,960
that engulfs that encircles the sun

523
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:17,119
and all the long period comets come

524
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,480
from the oort cloud they come the way

525
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,719
that they appear

526
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,519
i mean for already i don't know hundreds

527
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,400
of years

528
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,160
we've been detecting occasionally like a

529
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,640
comet will come in

530
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,519
and it comes seemingly comes out of

531
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,679
nowhere

532
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:32,558
the reason these long period comets

533
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,360
appear

534
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,079
that very on very very long time scales

535
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,759
right

536
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:39,599
these oort cloud objects that are

537
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:42,319
sitting you know 30

538
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,279
000 times as far away from the sun as is

539
00:18:42,319 --> 00:18:44,720
the earth

540
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:46,960
actually interact with the gravity of

541
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,279
the galaxy the tide

542
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,519
effectively the tide that the galaxy

543
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,440
exerts upon them and their orbits slowly

544
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:56,720
change and they elongate

545
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,360
to the point where once they their

546
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,079
closest approach to the sun starts to

547
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,319
reach

548
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,359
a critical distance where ice starts to

549
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:06,159
sublimate

550
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:08,159
then we discover them as comets because

551
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,798
then the ice comes off of them

552
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,640
they look beautiful on the night sky etc

553
00:19:10,798 --> 00:19:15,038
but they're all coming from

554
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,759
you know really really far away so is

555
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:18,319
there

556
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,160
are any of them coming our way from

557
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,480
collisions like how many collisions are

558
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,160
there

559
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,160
or is there a bunch of space for them to

560
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,679
move around yeah there's zero it's

561
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,360
completely collisionless

562
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:31,679
out there the physical radii of objects

563
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,558
are so small compared to the distance

564
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,440
between them

565
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:36,720
right it's just it is truly a

566
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,840
collisionless

567
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:42,798
uh environment i don't know there i

568
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:45,759
think that probably in the age

569
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,160
of the solar system there have literally

570
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,319
been zero collisions in the word cloud

571
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,679
wow when you like draw a picture of the

572
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,359
solar

573
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,038
system everything's really close

574
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,000
together so that everything i guess here

575
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,038
is

576
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,558
spaced far apart do rogue planets

577
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,960
like flying every once in a while and

578
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,279
join not rogue planets but rogue objects

579
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,759
from

580
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,319
out there oh sure oh sure yeah join the

581
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,319
party

582
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,599
yeah absolutely uh we've seen a couple

583
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:12,319
of them um

584
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,918
in the last three or f or so years uh

585
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,599
maybe four years now

586
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,880
uh one the first one uh was

587
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:23,199
the one called it's been

588
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,280
all over the news the second one was

589
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:29,840
comet borisov

590
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,839
discovered by a guy named borisov

591
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,519
yeah so the way you know they're coming

592
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,319
from elsewhere is

593
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:37,759
unlike solar system objects which travel

594
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:40,319
on elliptical paths

595
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:41,919
around the sun these guys travel on

596
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,079
hyperbolic paths

597
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,960
so they come in say hello and then

598
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:49,038
they're gone

599
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:52,319
and the fact that they exist

600
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:55,839
is totally like not surprising

601
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,720
right the neptune is con constantly

602
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,519
ejecting

603
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,600
kuiper belt objects into interstellar

604
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:04,879
space our solar system itself

605
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,879
is sort of leaking icy debris and

606
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,720
injecting it so

607
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,640
presumably every you know planetary

608
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,679
systems around other stars do exactly

609
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,559
the same thing

610
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,519
let me ask you about the the millions of

611
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,038
objects that are

612
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,798
part of the kuiper belt and the part of

613
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:19,200
the ore cloud do you think some of them

614
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,798
have

615
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,240
primitive life it kind of makes you sad

616
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:25,599
if there's like primitive life there and

617
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,558
they're just kind of like lonely out

618
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:28,079
there in space

619
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:30,240
like how many of them do you think have

620
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:31,599
life like bacterial life probably a

621
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,319
negligible amount

622
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:35,119
zero you know like zero was like a plus

623
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,879
on top

624
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:42,719
uh right yeah

625
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,720
um if so you know if you and i

626
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,038
took a little trip to the interstellar

627
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:50,240
medium i think we would develop cancer

628
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:53,038
and die uh real fast right that's rough

629
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,720
yeah it's a pretty hostile radiation

630
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:55,919
environment

631
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,120
you don't actually have to go to the

632
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,080
interstellar medium you just have to

633
00:21:57,119 --> 00:22:02,479
leave the earth's magnetic field too

634
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:03,279
and then you're not doing so well

635
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,200
suddenly

636
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:10,720
so you know this this idea of

637
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,159
you know life kind of traveling between

638
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,960
places it's not

639
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,720
it's not entirely implausible but you

640
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,558
you really have to

641
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,240
twist i think a lot of parameters one of

642
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:22,319
the problems we have is we don't

643
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,519
actually know how life originates

644
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:28,639
right so it's kind of a second order

645
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:31,119
question of survival in the interstellar

646
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,400
medium and how resilient it is because

647
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:37,759
we we think you require

648
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:41,120
water but and that's certainly the case

649
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:44,240
for the earth but you know we uh

650
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:46,479
we really don't know for sure that said

651
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:48,240
i will argue that the question of like

652
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:51,279
are there aliens out there

653
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,519
is a very boring question because

654
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:55,440
the answer is of course there are right

655
00:22:53,519 --> 00:22:58,879
i mean like

656
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:02,720
we know that there are planets around

657
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,320
almost every star um

658
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,960
of course there of course there are

659
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:09,200
other life forms life is not some

660
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,319
specific thing that happened on the

661
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,000
earth and that's it

662
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,319
right just that's a statistical

663
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,880
impossibility yeah um

664
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:17,918
yeah but the the difficult question is

665
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
before even

666
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,600
the fact that we don't know how life

667
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,319
originates i don't think we even know

668
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,399
what life

669
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,158
is like definitionally yeah like

670
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,120
formalizing a kind of picture

671
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,520
of in terms of the mechanism we would

672
00:23:29,119 --> 00:23:32,798
use

673
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,918
to to search for life out there or even

674
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,200
when we're on a planet

675
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,320
to say is this life is this rock that

676
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,120
just moved

677
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:41,839
from where it was yesterday life or or

678
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:44,079
maybe not even

679
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,119
rock something else i got to tell you i

680
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:50,000
want to know what life

681
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:53,359
is okay and i want you to show me

682
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,278
uh i think there's a song to basically

683
00:23:53,359 --> 00:23:57,759
accompany every single

684
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:59,599
thing we talk about today and probably

685
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:01,359
uh half of them are love songs

686
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:02,798
um and somehow we'll integrate george

687
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,798
michael into the whole thing okay

688
00:24:02,798 --> 00:24:07,918
so your intuition is there's life

689
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:09,599
everywhere in our universe

690
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,360
do you think there's intelligent life

691
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:11,918
out there i think it's entirely

692
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:16,798
plausible

693
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:18,799
i mean i it's entirely plausible um

694
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:19,839
i think i think there's intelligent life

695
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,200
on earth

696
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:25,839
um and so yeah taking that like say

697
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,759
whatever this thing we got on earth

698
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:29,918
whether it's dolphins or humans

699
00:24:27,759 --> 00:24:30,960
say that's intelligent definitely

700
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:34,799
dolphins

701
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:36,640
i mean have you seen the dolphins

702
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,200
well they do some cruel stuff to each

703
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,038
other so if cruelty

704
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,798
is uh is the definition of intelligence

705
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:44,240
that they're pretty good yeah and then

706
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,839
humans are pretty good on that

707
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,759
regard then there's like uh uh pigs

708
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:51,839
are very intelligent i got actually a

709
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,000
chance to hang out with pigs recently

710
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:55,119
and they're um aside from the fact

711
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,640
they're trying to

712
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:00,639
eat me they're very uh

713
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,000
they're very they love food they love

714
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,600
food but there's an intelligence to

715
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,720
their eyes that was kind of

716
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:09,678
uh like haunts me because i also

717
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,319
love to eat meat and then to to me the

718
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,080
thing

719
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:16,079
i later ate and i was very intelligent

720
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:17,439
and uh almost charismatic with the way

721
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,399
it was expressing its uh

722
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,278
himself herself itself was uh was quite

723
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,360
incredible

724
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:26,880
so and all that to say is if we have

725
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,399
intelligent life here on earth if we

726
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,559
take dolphins pigs

727
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,679
humans from the perspective of like

728
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:35,038
planetary science

729
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,519
how unique is earth okay so earth is not

730
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:38,558
a com

731
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,079
common outcome of the planet formation

732
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,079
process

733
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:46,639
um it's probably a

734
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:48,079
something on the order of maybe a one

735
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,880
percent effect

736
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,720
and by earth i mean it's not just an

737
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,840
earth mass planet

738
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,960
okay i mean the architecture of the

739
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:00,158
solar system

740
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,880
that allows the earth to exist in in its

741
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,080
kind of

742
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,760
very temperate um

743
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:10,240
way one thing to understand

744
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:11,440
uh and this is this is pretty crucial uh

745
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,960
right it's that the

746
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,320
earth itself formed well after

747
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:21,360
the gas disk that formed

748
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,359
the giant planets

749
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,038
had already dissipated you see stars

750
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,679
start out

751
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,519
with you know the star and then a disc

752
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:33,840
of gas and dust that encircles it

753
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:37,278
okay from this disk of gas and dust

754
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:39,759
big planets can emerge and we have

755
00:26:37,278 --> 00:26:41,278
over the last uh you know two three

756
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,759
decades discovered

757
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:44,960
thousands of extra solar planets as an

758
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:48,000
orbit of other studs

759
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,319
what we see is that uh many of them

760
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,519
are you know have these expansive

761
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,038
hydrogen helium

762
00:26:51,519 --> 00:26:58,720
atmospheres the fact that the earth

763
00:26:55,038 --> 00:26:59,038
doesn't is deeply connected to the fact

764
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,880
that

765
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,119
earth took about 100 million years to

766
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,760
form so we missed that

767
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:07,759
you know train so to speak to get that

768
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:10,079
hydrogen helium atmosphere

769
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:11,519
that's why actually we can see the sky

770
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:14,798
right that's why the

771
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,440
sky is uh well at least in most places

772
00:27:14,798 --> 00:27:18,839
that's why the

773
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,480
the atmosphere is not completely opaque

774
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:22,558
um

775
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,000
with that you know kind of thinking in

776
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:26,639
mind i

777
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,480
i would argue that we're getting the

778
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,960
kind of emergent pictures that the earth

779
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,240
is

780
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:34,960
is not you know everywhere

781
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,880
right we there's sort of the sci-fi view

782
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,720
of things where we go to some other star

783
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,720
and we just land on random planets and

784
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,759
they're all earth-like that's totally

785
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,360
not true

786
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:47,599
but the even a low probability

787
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:49,038
event even if you imagine that earth is

788
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:52,558
a one in a million

789
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:56,240
or one in a you know one in 10 million

790
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:58,079
occurrence there are 10 to the 12 stars

791
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,120
in the galaxy

792
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,278
right so you just you always win by

793
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,398
by large numbers that's right by supply

794
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,880
they save you well

795
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:08,719
you've hypothesized that our our solar

796
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,960
system once possessed a

797
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,600
population of short-period planets that

798
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,038
were destroyed by the evil jupiter

799
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,480
uh migrating through the the solar

800
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,798
nebula can you explain

801
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,880
if i was to say what was the kind of the

802
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,079
key outcome of searches for extrasolar

803
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,120
planets

804
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,879
it is that most stars are encircled by

805
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:32,798
short period planets

806
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,159
that are you know a few earth masses

807
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:35,839
right so a few times bigger than the

808
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,000
earth um

809
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,759
and have orbital periods that kind of

810
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,599
range from days to

811
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:46,319
to weeks now if you go in

812
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,278
and ask the solar system what's in our

813
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,119
region

814
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,480
right in that region it's completely

815
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:53,519
empty right

816
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:57,120
it's just it's astonishingly hollow

817
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:58,960
and thank you from

818
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:01,119
the sun is not some you know special

819
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,000
star that decided that it was going to

820
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,000
form

821
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,240
the the solar system so i think you know

822
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,119
the natural thing to assume

823
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,399
is is that the same processes of planet

824
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,719
formation that occurred

825
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,639
everywhere else also occurred in the

826
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,480
solar system

827
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,320
following this logic it's not

828
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,079
implausible to imagine that the solar

829
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:24,158
system once possessed

830
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:27,678
a system of intra mercurian

831
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,399
like you know compact system of

832
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,798
of planets so then we asked ourselves

833
00:29:30,398 --> 00:29:33,519
would

834
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:34,960
such a system survive to this day and

835
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,839
the answer is no

836
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,159
uh at least our calculations um suggest

837
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,519
it's highly unlikely because of the

838
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,200
formation of jupiter

839
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,879
and jupiter's primordial kind of

840
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,360
wandering through the solar system

841
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,120
would have sent this collisional field

842
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,599
of debris that would have pushed

843
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,479
that system of planets onto the sun so

844
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:55,359
was jupiter

845
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,399
this primordial wandering what did what

846
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:58,479
did jupiter look like

847
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:00,158
like why was it wandering it didn't have

848
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,000
the orbit it has today

849
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,840
uh we're pretty certain that giant

850
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,880
planets like jupiter when they form they

851
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:08,158
migrate

852
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,600
the reason they migrate is you know on a

853
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,080
detailed level perhaps

854
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:14,558
difficult to explain but you know if

855
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:18,158
just in a qualitative sense

856
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:21,038
they form in this fluid disk

857
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,278
of gas and dust so it's kind of like if

858
00:30:21,038 --> 00:30:24,480
i

859
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:27,839
plop down a raft somewhere in the ocean

860
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,640
will it stay in where you plop it down

861
00:30:27,839 --> 00:30:30,959
or will it

862
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,559
kind of get carried around it's not

863
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:34,000
really a good analogy because it's not

864
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:36,720
like jupiter is being

865
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,319
affected by the currents of you know gas

866
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,519
and dust but the way

867
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:44,480
it migrates is it carves out a hole

868
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:46,240
in the in the disk and then uh through

869
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,960
by interacting with the disk

870
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,599
gravitationally right it can change its

871
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,278
orbit the fact that the solar system has

872
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,599
both jupiter and saturn

873
00:30:53,278 --> 00:30:57,679
here complicates things a lot right

874
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,079
because it's you have to

875
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,159
solve the problem of the evolution of

876
00:31:00,079 --> 00:31:04,240
the gas disk the evolution of jupiter's

877
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,559
orbit in the gas disk plus

878
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,720
evolution of saturn's and their mutual

879
00:31:06,558 --> 00:31:12,079
interaction

880
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,720
the common outcome of solving

881
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:15,359
that problem though is pretty easy to

882
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,399
explain

883
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,000
jupiter forms its orbit shrinks and then

884
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:22,319
once saturn forms

885
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,640
its orbit catches up basically to the

886
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,639
orbit of jupiter and then both come out

887
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,000
so there's this inward outward pattern

888
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,919
of jupiter's

889
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,720
early motion that happens sort of within

890
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:35,120
the firm within the last million years

891
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,640
of the lifetime of the solar system's

892
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:40,000
primordial disk

893
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:42,880
so do while this is happening

894
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,839
if our calculations are correct which i

895
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,039
think they are

896
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,558
you can destroy these in this inner

897
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,679
system of

898
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:54,639
you know few earth mass planets

899
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:55,519
and then in the aftermath of all this

900
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,640
violence

901
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,240
you form the terrestrial planets where

902
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,519
would they come from in that case so

903
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:05,440
so jupiter clears out the space and then

904
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,679
there's a a few terrestrial planets that

905
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,480
come in and those coming from

906
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,360
the from the disk somewhere like one of

907
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,278
the larger

908
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:15,678
yeah what actually happens in these

909
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:19,038
calculations is you leave behind

910
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:22,320
a rather mass depleted like

911
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,278
remnant remnant disk only a couple earth

912
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:26,639
masses

913
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:30,079
so then from that

914
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,960
remnant population annulus of material

915
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:34,158
over 100 or about 100 million years by

916
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,399
just collisions

917
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:38,399
you grow the earth and the moon and

918
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,879
everything else you said amulous

919
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,239
annulus and yours annulus yeah that's a

920
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,840
beautiful word what does that mean

921
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,679
well it's like it's like a disc that's

922
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:48,798
kind of thin it's like a

923
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,640
yeah it's something that is you know a

924
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:54,000
disc that's so thin it's almost

925
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,600
flirting with being a ring like

926
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,679
i was gonna say this reminds me lord of

927
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,599
the rings so like this the word just

928
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:00,880
feels like it belongs in a toll canal

929
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,439
okay uh

930
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,200
so that that's incredible and so that in

931
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,399
your senses you said like one percent

932
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:10,080
that's a rare

933
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:13,839
the way jupiter and saturn danced and

934
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:17,119
cleared out and you know cleared out the

935
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,558
the the short period debris and then

936
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:20,158
changed the gravitational landscape

937
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,960
that's a pretty rare thing too

938
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,960
it's rare and moreover like you don't

939
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,278
have to go to our calculations you can

940
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,558
just

941
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:31,200
ask the night sky how many stars

942
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,000
have jupiter and saturn analogs the

943
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,840
answer is

944
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,038
jupiter and saturn analogs are found

945
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:37,038
around only 10

946
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,398
of sun-mic stars so they are they

947
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:40,398
themselves like you kind of have to

948
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,558
score an a minus or better

949
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,798
on the test to you know on the planet

950
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:47,599
formation test to become

951
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,480
a solar system analog even in that basic

952
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,839
sense

953
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,399
and moreover um you know low lower mass

954
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:56,319
stars

955
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:59,119
which are uh very numerous in the galaxy

956
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:59,759
so-called m dwarfs think like zero

957
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,639
percent

958
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,960
of them well maybe like a negligible

959
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,639
fraction of them have giant planets

960
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,199
giant planets are a rare

961
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,919
you know outcome of planet formation one

962
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,598
of the

963
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:15,358
really big problems that remain

964
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,000
unanswered is why we don't actually

965
00:34:15,358 --> 00:34:19,358
understand

966
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:20,480
why they're so rare how hard is it to

967
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:21,440
simulate

968
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,800
all of the things that we've been

969
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,918
talking about each of the things we've

970
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,720
been talking about

971
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:28,480
and maybe one day all of the things

972
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:31,918
we've been talking about and beyond

973
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,358
meaning like from the initial

974
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,719
primordial solar system you know a bunch

975
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,719
of disks with

976
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,759
i don't know billions trillions of

977
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,078
objects in them

978
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,240
like simulate that such that you

979
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,639
eventually get a jupiter

980
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,078
and a saturn then eventually you get the

981
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,679
jupiter and the saturn they clear out a

982
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,800
disc change the gravitational landscape

983
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,119
then earth pops up

984
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,320
like that whole thing and then be able

985
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,680
to do that

986
00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:00,160
for every other system

987
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,039
in the uh every other star in the galaxy

988
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,759
and then

989
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:05,440
be able to do that for other galaxies as

990
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,920
well

991
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,280
um yeah so look maybe start from the

992
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,358
smallest simulation

993
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,880
like what is actually being done today i

994
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,239
mean even the smallest simulation is

995
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,160
probably super super difficult

996
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:17,519
even just like one object in the kuiper

997
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,239
belt is probably super difficult to

998
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,639
simulate

999
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:21,598
i mean i think it's super easy i mean

1000
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:25,358
like it's

1001
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:27,920
it's just not that hard um but um

1002
00:35:25,358 --> 00:35:28,480
you know let's let's ask the most kind

1003
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,039
of

1004
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,000
basic problem okay so the problem of

1005
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,199
having a star

1006
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,559
and something in orbit of it that you

1007
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:38,078
don't need a simulation for like

1008
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,480
you can just write that down on a piece

1009
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,240
of paper this gravity

1010
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,400
would like yeah i guess i guess it's

1011
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:47,679
important to try to

1012
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,200
uh you know one way to simulate objects

1013
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:51,039
in our solar system is to build the

1014
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:52,639
universe from scratch okay

1015
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,800
we'll get to building the universe from

1016
00:35:52,639 --> 00:35:56,639
scratch in a sec um but let me just kind

1017
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,440
of go through the hierarchy of

1018
00:35:56,639 --> 00:36:00,480
what you know what we do two objects two

1019
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,280
objects

1020
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,679
analytically solvable like we can figure

1021
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,760
it out

1022
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:07,279
very easily if you just you don't i

1023
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
don't think you yeah you don't need to

1024
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,079
know calculus

1025
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,480
uh it helps to know calculus but you

1026
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,480
don't necessarily need to know calculus

1027
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,599
um three objects that are

1028
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,480
gravitationally

1029
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,359
interacting the solution is chaotic

1030
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,079
doesn't matter

1031
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:23,920
how many simulations you do you the

1032
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:26,320
answer loses meaning after

1033
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:30,000
um after some time i feel like that is a

1034
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,000
metaphor for dating as well but go on

1035
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:36,159
now look yes yeah so so

1036
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,280
the fact that you go from analytically

1037
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,960
solvable

1038
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,720
to unpredictable you know when you are

1039
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:44,639
when your simulation goes from two up

1040
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:47,519
bodies to three bodies

1041
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,400
should immediately tell you that the

1042
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,519
exercise

1043
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,800
of trying to engineer a calculation

1044
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:55,440
where you form this whole

1045
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,680
entire solar system from scratch and

1046
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,000
hope to have some predictive answer

1047
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:04,239
is is a futile one right we will never

1048
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,079
uh succeed at such a simulation just to

1049
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:09,279
clarify you mean like explicitly having

1050
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,200
a clear equation that generalizes

1051
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,960
the the whole process enough to be able

1052
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:15,279
to make a prediction what do you mean

1053
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,960
actually like literally simulating the

1054
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,800
objects as a hopeless pursuit

1055
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:20,240
once it increases beyond three the

1056
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,680
simulating them is not a hopeless

1057
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:26,078
pursuit but the

1058
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:27,759
outcome becomes a statistical one

1059
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,680
and what's actually quite interesting is

1060
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,960
i think we have

1061
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:35,759
all the equations uh figured out

1062
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,880
right like you know in order to really

1063
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,960
understand this

1064
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,880
the formation of the the solar system it

1065
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,079
suffices to know

1066
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,480
gravity and magneto hydrodynamics i mean

1067
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,720
like

1068
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,519
the combination of uh maxwell's

1069
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:49,519
equations and

1070
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,280
you know navier-stokes equations for the

1071
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,119
fluids you need to know quantum

1072
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,040
mechanics to understand

1073
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:59,680
opacities and and so on but we have

1074
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,079
those equations in hand it's not that we

1075
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:01,759
don't

1076
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,160
have that understanding it's that

1077
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,359
putting it all together

1078
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,639
is a very very difficult and b if you

1079
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:11,759
were to run

1080
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:14,559
the same evolution twice

1081
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,040
changing you know the initial conditions

1082
00:38:14,559 --> 00:38:18,159
by

1083
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:20,079
some infinitesimal amounts i'm you know

1084
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:21,519
minor change in your calculation to

1085
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:23,039
start with you would get the or you'd

1086
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:26,800
get a different answer

1087
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:29,679
this is one this is part of the reason

1088
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,640
why planetary systems are so diverse you

1089
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,960
don't

1090
00:38:30,639 --> 00:38:33,920
have like a you know very predictive

1091
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,720
path

1092
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,680
for you start with a disk of this mass

1093
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,838
and

1094
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,759
it's around this star therefore you're

1095
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,679
going to form the solar system

1096
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,280
right you start with this and therefore

1097
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:47,919
you will conform this huge

1098
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,200
outcome a huge set of outcomes and some

1099
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,800
percentage of it

1100
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:52,480
will resemble the solar system you

1101
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,400
mentioned quantum mechanics and

1102
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,880
we're talking about cosmic scale

1103
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,039
objects you've talked about that the

1104
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,838
evolution of astrophysical disks can be

1105
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:06,079
modeled with

1106
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:09,358
uh schroedinger's equation i sure did

1107
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,640
why it's like how does quantum mechanics

1108
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,639
uh become relevant at when you

1109
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,159
consider the evolution of objects in the

1110
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:18,000
solar system yeah

1111
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:19,838
well let me take a take a step back and

1112
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:23,760
just say like i remember

1113
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:25,519
being you know utterly confused

1114
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,040
by quantum mechanics when i first

1115
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:29,199
learned it and

1116
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,639
the schrodinger equation which is kind

1117
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:33,598
of the parent equation

1118
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,799
of of that whole field you know seems to

1119
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:37,519
come out of nowhere

1120
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,000
right the way that the way that i was

1121
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,838
sort of explaining it i remember asking

1122
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,920
you know my professor is like but where

1123
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:46,159
does it come from is that like well just

1124
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,519
just like don't worry about it and just

1125
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,639
like calculate the

1126
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,320
hydrogen you know energy levels right so

1127
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:55,279
it's like i could do all the problems i

1128
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:57,838
just did not have any intuition for

1129
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,760
for where this parent you know super

1130
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,440
important equation came from

1131
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,520
now down the line i was remember i was

1132
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,440
preparing for my own

1133
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:07,519
lecture and i was trying to understand

1134
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:11,760
how waves

1135
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:15,119
travel in self-gravitating discs so

1136
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,800
you know again there's a very broad

1137
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,640
theory that's already developed but i

1138
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,640
was looking for some simpler

1139
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,480
way to explain it really for the

1140
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,519
purposes of teaching class

1141
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,039
and so i i thought okay what if i just

1142
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:31,519
imagine a disc as an infinite uh

1143
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:32,880
number of concentric circles right that

1144
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:36,159
interact with

1145
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,599
the with each other gravitationally

1146
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:42,799
that's a problem in some sense that um

1147
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:46,240
i can solve using methods from like the

1148
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,079
late 1700s right so i can write down

1149
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,838
hamiltonian well i can write down the

1150
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:54,800
energy function basically of their

1151
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:56,239
their interactions and what i

1152
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,160
found is that when you take the

1153
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,318
continuum limit when you

1154
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:02,239
go from discrete circles that are

1155
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:02,960
talking to each other gravitationally to

1156
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:06,000
a

1157
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:08,960
continuum disk suddenly

1158
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,920
this gravitational interaction among

1159
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,079
them

1160
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,838
right the the governing equation becomes

1161
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,359
the schrodinger equation

1162
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,759
and i had to think about that for a

1163
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,318
little bit did you just unify

1164
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,240
quantum mechanics and gravity no this is

1165
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,239
not the same thing as like

1166
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:25,439
you know fusing relativity and quantum

1167
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,799
mechanics

1168
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,358
but it did uh it did get me thinking a

1169
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,800
little bit

1170
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,838
so the fact that waves in astrophysical

1171
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,039
disks

1172
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:39,279
behave just like wave functions of

1173
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:41,599
of particles kind of like an interesting

1174
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,200
analogy because for me it's easier to

1175
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,800
imagine waves traveling through you know

1176
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,960
astrophysical disks or really just

1177
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,960
sheets of paper and

1178
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,400
the reason this is that analogy exists

1179
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:57,039
is because there's actually nothing

1180
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,318
quantum about the schrodinger equation

1181
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:01,440
the schrodinger equation

1182
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:04,079
is just a wave equation

1183
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,119
and all of the interpretation that comes

1184
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:08,560
from it

1185
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:11,920
is quantum but the equation itself

1186
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,559
is not a quantum being so you can use it

1187
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,039
to model

1188
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,000
waves it's way it's not turtles it's

1189
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,000
waves all the way down

1190
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,079
you can pick which level you pick the

1191
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,920
wave at and so it could be at the solar

1192
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,000
system level that you can use right

1193
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,440
and also it actually provides a pretty

1194
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,199
neat calculational tool

1195
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:30,720
because um it's it's difficult so we

1196
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,239
just talked about simulations but it's

1197
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,118
difficult to simulate

1198
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:36,479
the behavior of astrophysical disks on

1199
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:40,079
time scales

1200
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,280
that are in between a few orbits

1201
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,519
and their entire evolution so it's

1202
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,599
over a time scale of a few orbits you

1203
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:48,880
have you do a hydrodynamic you know

1204
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,160
simulation

1205
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,200
right you do that basically that's

1206
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,199
something that you can do

1207
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,480
on a modern computer on a time scale of

1208
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:58,719
say a week

1209
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,880
when it comes to their evolution over

1210
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:02,719
their entire lifetime you don't hope to

1211
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,920
resolve the orbits you just kind of

1212
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,318
hope to understand how the system

1213
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,960
behaves in between

1214
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:09,920
right you to get access to that as it

1215
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,639
turns out it's pretty

1216
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:14,240
um it's pretty cute you can use uh you

1217
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:15,279
can use the schrodinger equation to get

1218
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:17,358
the answer

1219
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,640
rapidly so it's a calculational tool

1220
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:22,239
that's fascinating by the way the

1221
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:24,318
astrophysical disks how what are they

1222
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:27,118
how broad is this definition okay so

1223
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:31,119
astrophysical disks span

1224
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:33,599
a huge uh huge amount of ranges

1225
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,280
they start maybe at the smallest scale

1226
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,039
they start with actually kuiper belt

1227
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:38,400
objects some kuiper belt objects have

1228
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:40,960
rings

1229
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,160
so that's maybe the smallest example of

1230
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,318
an astrophysical disc

1231
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:45,358
we've got this little potato shaped

1232
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:47,519
asteroid

1233
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:50,000
you know which is you know sort of the

1234
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:54,000
size of la or something and around it

1235
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,800
is are some rings of icy matter that

1236
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,599
object is a small astrophysical disk

1237
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,640
then you have

1238
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:02,000
saturn the rings of saturn you have the

1239
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:03,759
next set of scale you have the solar

1240
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,079
system itself when it was forming you

1241
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,359
have

1242
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,960
this then you have black hole discs

1243
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:12,000
you have galaxies discs are super common

1244
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,358
in the universe

1245
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,838
and the reason is that stuff rotates

1246
00:44:15,358 --> 00:44:20,239
right i mean gravity works yeah so uh

1247
00:44:17,838 --> 00:44:24,000
and those rings could be the material

1248
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:26,078
that uh composes those rings could be

1249
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,199
it could be gas it could be solid it

1250
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:32,240
could be anything that's right so

1251
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:34,159
the disc that made from which the

1252
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,639
planets emerged was predominantly

1253
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,399
hydrogen helium gas on the other hand

1254
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,118
the rings of saturn

1255
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:42,960
are made up of you know icicles ice

1256
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,280
little like

1257
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,639
ice cubes this big about a centimeter

1258
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,560
across

1259
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,960
that sounds refreshing so that's

1260
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:53,358
incredible hydrogen helium gas

1261
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,880
so in the beginning it was just hydrogen

1262
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,358
and helium

1263
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,960
around the sun how does that lead to the

1264
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:02,480
first formations of solid

1265
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,440
objects in terms of simulation okay

1266
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,679
here's the story um so you're like have

1267
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,358
you ever been to the desert

1268
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,440
yes i've been to the death valley and

1269
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:13,759
actually it was uh terrifying just as

1270
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,800
total tangent i'm distracting you but i

1271
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,079
was uh

1272
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,240
driving through it and i was really

1273
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,119
surprised because it was at first

1274
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:23,279
hot and then as it was getting into the

1275
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,680
evening there's this huge thunderstorm

1276
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,920
like

1277
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:26,960
it was raining and it got freezing cold

1278
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,280
like what the hell is

1279
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,480
it was the apocalypse yeah i had to like

1280
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,680
just sit there

1281
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,838
listening to bruce springsteen i

1282
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:34,639
remember and just thinking i'm probably

1283
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:36,480
going to die

1284
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:38,000
and i was okay with it because bruce

1285
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,400
springsteen was on the radio look

1286
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,079
when you've got the boss you know you're

1287
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,119
ready you're ready to meet the ball

1288
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:48,240
yeah so look i mean it's a good line

1289
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,079
so i'm sorry that's true um

1290
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:51,279
yeah by the way like to continue on this

1291
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:54,318
tangent i

1292
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,760
i absolutely love the southwest for this

1293
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,719
reason just um you know i know during

1294
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,680
the pandemic i

1295
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:02,239
drove from la to new mexico a bunch of

1296
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,199
times

1297
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,078
the madness the weather yeah the the the

1298
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:07,679
chaos of

1299
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:09,359
weather the fact that you know it'll be

1300
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:10,480
blazing hot one minute and then it's

1301
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,078
just like

1302
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,000
we'll decide to have a little

1303
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:16,560
thunderstorm maybe you'll decide

1304
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,920
to go back momentarily to like a

1305
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:18,960
thousand degrees and then go back to the

1306
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,519
thunderstorm

1307
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,519
it's amazing it's it's that by the way

1308
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:25,759
is chaos theory in action yeah

1309
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:27,039
right um but let's get back to talking

1310
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,079
about the desert yeah

1311
00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:32,318
so in the desert um tumbleweeds

1312
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,359
have a tendency to roll because the wind

1313
00:46:32,318 --> 00:46:35,838
rolls them

1314
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:37,759
and if you're careful you'll

1315
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,920
occasionally see this family of temple

1316
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,599
weeds where like there's like a big one

1317
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,519
and then there's a bunch of little ones

1318
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,838
that that kind of hide in its

1319
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:47,358
wake right and are all rolling together

1320
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,119
and still almost looks like

1321
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:50,400
you know a family of ducks crossing a

1322
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,838
street or something

1323
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:56,079
um or for example you know

1324
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:58,078
if you watch tour de france right you've

1325
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,119
got a whole bunch of cyclists and

1326
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,440
they're like cycling

1327
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:02,559
you know within 10 centimeters of each

1328
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,880
other they're not

1329
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:05,920
bffs right yeah but they're not yeah

1330
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,599
trying to be

1331
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:09,680
trying to write together they are

1332
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,800
writing together to minimize the

1333
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:13,679
collective

1334
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,480
uh you know air resistance if you will

1335
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:17,440
that uh

1336
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,760
that they experience turns out solids in

1337
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,679
the protoplanetary disk do

1338
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:26,960
just this there's an instability

1339
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:27,919
wherein solid particles right things

1340
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,639
that are

1341
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:33,760
a centimeter across will start to hide

1342
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:37,598
behind one another and form these clouds

1343
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,720
why because cumulatively that minimizes

1344
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,440
the solid

1345
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:43,679
component of the disk aerodynamic

1346
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,760
interaction with the gas

1347
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:47,440
now these clouds because they're kind of

1348
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:50,079
a favorable

1349
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,639
energetic condition for the dust to live

1350
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:53,359
in

1351
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:54,960
they grow grow grow grow grow until they

1352
00:47:53,358 --> 00:47:56,558
become so massive that they collapse

1353
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,800
under their own weight

1354
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,400
that's how the first building blocks of

1355
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,318
planets form that's how the

1356
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:04,000
big asteroids got there that's

1357
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,159
incredible yeah so that

1358
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:08,400
is that simulatable or is it not useful

1359
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:10,960
to simulate no no that's simulatable

1360
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,920
um and people do these types of

1361
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,480
calculations

1362
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,960
it's it's really cool that's actually

1363
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,559
that's

1364
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,960
one of the many fields of planet

1365
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,599
formation theory that is really really

1366
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:20,639
active

1367
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,359
right now people are trying to

1368
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:24,558
understand all kinds of aspects of that

1369
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,799
process because of course

1370
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:28,079
i've explained it you know like as if

1371
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:31,200
there's one

1372
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:34,960
thing that happens turns out it's a

1373
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:37,838
it's a beautifully rich dynamic but the

1374
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,639
but qualitatively formation of the first

1375
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:40,558
building blocks

1376
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:41,759
actually follows the same sequence as

1377
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,280
formation of stars

1378
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:49,119
right stars are just clouds of gas

1379
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:53,040
hydrogen helium gas that sit in space

1380
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:56,000
and slowly cool and at some point they

1381
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,400
you know contract to a point where their

1382
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,079
gravity overtakes the thermal

1383
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,680
you know pressure support if you will

1384
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,440
and they collapse under their own weight

1385
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:05,279
and you get a little baby solar system

1386
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,119
that's amazing so do you think one day

1387
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:10,400
it will be possible to

1388
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:13,039
simulate the full history

1389
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,200
that took our solar system to what it is

1390
00:49:13,039 --> 00:49:18,318
today

1391
00:49:15,199 --> 00:49:20,239
yes and it will be useless okay

1392
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,000
so you don't think your story many of

1393
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:23,358
the ideas that you have about jupiter

1394
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,039
clear in the space

1395
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:26,719
like retelling that story in high

1396
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,719
resolution is not that important

1397
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:30,239
i actually think it's important but at

1398
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,439
every stage

1399
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,000
you have to you have to simul you have

1400
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,240
to

1401
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,199
design your experiments your your

1402
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,439
numerical computer experiments so that

1403
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:43,598
they test some specific aspect of that

1404
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,960
evolution

1405
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:50,720
um i am not a proponent of doing

1406
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:53,838
huge simulations because um

1407
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:57,279
even if we forget the information theory

1408
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:58,799
aspect of not being able to simulate in

1409
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:02,240
full detail

1410
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:05,119
the universe because if you do then

1411
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:05,679
you you have made an actual universe

1412
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,160
it's not

1413
00:50:05,679 --> 00:50:09,679
the simulation right by simulation is in

1414
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,838
some sense a compression

1415
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:13,279
of information so therefore you must

1416
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:16,799
lose detail

1417
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:19,920
but that point aside if we are

1418
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,160
able to simulate

1419
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:24,079
the entire history of the solar system

1420
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:26,719
in excruciating detail

1421
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,200
i mean it'll be cool but it's not going

1422
00:50:26,719 --> 00:50:31,039
to be

1423
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:34,239
any different from observing it

1424
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,039
right because theoretical understanding

1425
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,239
which is what

1426
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:41,519
ultimately i'm interested in um

1427
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:43,519
comes from taking complex things and

1428
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,759
reducing them down to something

1429
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:47,519
that you know some mechanism that you

1430
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,240
can actually quantify

1431
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:51,039
um that's the that's the fun part of

1432
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,639
astrophysics

1433
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,318
just kind of simulating things in

1434
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:56,159
extreme detail

1435
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:58,880
is we'll cool we'll make cool

1436
00:50:56,159 --> 00:51:01,679
visualizations but that doesn't get to

1437
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,039
doesn't doesn't get you to any better

1438
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:05,279
understanding than you had

1439
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,880
before you did the simulation if you ask

1440
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,240
very specific questions then you'll be

1441
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,079
able to uh

1442
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:14,000
create like very highly compressed

1443
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:15,680
nice beautiful theories about how things

1444
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:18,000
evolved and then you can use those to

1445
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:21,039
then generalize to other solar systems

1446
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:23,358
to other stars and other galaxies and

1447
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:24,719
say something generalizable about the

1448
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:28,318
entire universe

1449
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:30,719
how difficult would it be to simulate

1450
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,838
our solar system such that we would not

1451
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:35,598
know the difference

1452
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:38,239
meaning if we are living in a simulation

1453
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,640
is there a nice think of it as a video

1454
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:40,479
game

1455
00:51:38,639 --> 00:51:42,078
sure is there a nice compressible way of

1456
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,838
doing that or

1457
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,000
just kind of like you intuited with a

1458
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:48,159
three body situation

1459
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,079
is just a giant mess that you cannot

1460
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:53,199
create a video game

1461
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,079
that uh will seem realistic without

1462
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,039
actually

1463
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:58,880
building it so i'm you know i'm

1464
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:01,920
speculating but

1465
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:03,680
one of the yeah i know i know like

1466
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,280
you have a deep understanding of this

1467
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:08,318
but like for me

1468
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:11,839
i'm just gonna like speculate that for

1469
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:12,800
um at least in the types of simulations

1470
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:15,759
that we can do

1471
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:17,440
today inevitably you run into the

1472
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,599
problem of resolution

1473
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,358
right you're doesn't matter what you're

1474
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:24,720
doing it is discrete

1475
00:52:21,358 --> 00:52:26,639
now um the way you would go

1476
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:28,799
about asking you know if what we're

1477
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:31,440
observing is that a simulation or

1478
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,480
uh or is that you know some real

1479
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,519
continuous

1480
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,440
thing uh is you you zoom in right you

1481
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:41,280
zoom in and try and find

1482
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:46,000
the you know the grid scale if you will

1483
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:48,240
um yeah i mean

1484
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,519
it's a it's a really interesting it's a

1485
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,959
really interesting question

1486
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:55,920
and because the

1487
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:58,240
solar system itself and really you know

1488
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:00,880
the double pendulum is chaotic

1489
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:03,039
right pendulum sitting on another

1490
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,838
pendulum

1491
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:06,719
moves unpredictably once you let them go

1492
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,838
um

1493
00:53:06,719 --> 00:53:12,159
you really don't need to like inject any

1494
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,558
randomness into a simulation for it to

1495
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:15,838
to give you stochastic and unpredictable

1496
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,160
answers

1497
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:20,159
weather is a great example of this

1498
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:22,639
weather has a happen of time

1499
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:24,879
of you know typical weather systems have

1500
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:27,519
a happen of time of a few days

1501
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,000
and there's a fundamental reason why the

1502
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:30,719
force

1503
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,920
forecast always sucks you know two weeks

1504
00:53:30,719 --> 00:53:34,558
in advance

1505
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:37,280
it's not that we don't know the

1506
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,200
equations that govern

1507
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,040
the atmosphere we know them well their

1508
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,318
solutions are meaningless though after a

1509
00:53:41,039 --> 00:53:45,119
few days

1510
00:53:42,318 --> 00:53:45,358
the zooming in thing is very interesting

1511
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,400
i

1512
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:49,598
i think about this a lot whether

1513
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,838
there'll be a time

1514
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:53,200
soon where we would want to stay in

1515
00:53:51,838 --> 00:53:54,639
video game worlds

1516
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:56,639
whether it's virtual reality or just

1517
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,279
playing video games i mean i think that

1518
00:53:56,639 --> 00:54:00,879
time

1519
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,880
like came in like the 90s and it's been

1520
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,920
that time well it's not just it's not

1521
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,720
just games i mean

1522
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,200
it's accelerated i just recently saw

1523
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,639
that

1524
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,439
wow and fortnite were played 140 billion

1525
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:13,199
hours

1526
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,119
and those are just video games yeah and

1527
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,318
that's like increasing very very quickly

1528
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,480
especially with the people

1529
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:20,639
coming up now and being born now and

1530
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,240
become you know becoming teenagers

1531
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:23,920
and so on let's have a thought

1532
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:26,159
experiment where it's just you and a

1533
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,639
video game character inside a room

1534
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:31,679
where you remove the simulation they

1535
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:33,759
need to simulate sort of

1536
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,078
a lot of objects if it's just you and

1537
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:38,720
that character

1538
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,599
how far do you need to simulate in terms

1539
00:54:38,719 --> 00:54:42,879
of zooming in

1540
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,680
for it to be very real to you as real as

1541
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,838
reality

1542
00:54:43,679 --> 00:54:47,039
so like first of all you kind of

1543
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:48,480
mentioned zooming in which is

1544
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:50,239
fascinating because

1545
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,519
we have these tools of science that

1546
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:55,199
allow us to zoom in

1547
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:57,440
quote unquote in all kinds of ways

1548
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,439
uh in the world around us but our

1549
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,639
cognitive abilities like our perception

1550
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,400
system as humans

1551
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:04,318
is very limited in terms of situations

1552
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,318
so we might be very easily fooled

1553
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:11,199
some of the video games like on the ps4

1554
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:13,279
yeah like look pretty real to me yeah

1555
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:15,439
right uh i think

1556
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:16,798
you would really have to interrogate i

1557
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:17,599
mean i think even with what we have

1558
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,798
today

1559
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,240
like uh i don't know ace combat seven

1560
00:55:20,798 --> 00:55:24,239
that's a great example

1561
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:25,519
right like i mean the way that the

1562
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:28,719
clouds are rendered

1563
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:30,400
uh it's i mean it

1564
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:32,239
looks just like when you're flying you

1565
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,119
know on a real airplane the

1566
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:35,838
the kind of transparency i think that

1567
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,880
the

1568
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:40,318
you know our perception is limited

1569
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,000
enough already

1570
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:46,318
to not be able to tell some of the uh

1571
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:47,599
you know some of the differences there's

1572
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:50,000
a game called uh

1573
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,280
skyrim it's an elder scrolls role

1574
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,239
playing game

1575
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,040
and i just uh i played it for quite a

1576
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,159
bit

1577
00:55:55,039 --> 00:55:58,880
and i think i played very different than

1578
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:00,879
others like

1579
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,240
there'll be long searches of time where

1580
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,119
i would just walk around and look at

1581
00:56:02,239 --> 00:56:06,318
nature

1582
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,160
in the game it's incredible oh sure it's

1583
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,880
just like the graphics is like

1584
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:12,159
wow i want to stay there it was better i

1585
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:15,280
went hiking recently

1586
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:16,000
it was like as good as hiking so look i

1587
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,319
know what you mean

1588
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,599
not to go on a huge video game you know

1589
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:23,358
tangent but like

1590
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:25,599
the the third like witcher game was

1591
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:26,719
astonishingly beautiful right especially

1592
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:29,760
like playing on

1593
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:31,199
on a good hardware machine it's like

1594
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:36,000
this is pretty

1595
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:38,159
this is pretty legit that said um

1596
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,119
you know i i don't resonate with the i

1597
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:40,960
want to stay

1598
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:43,200
here you know like one of the things

1599
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:46,480
that i love to do

1600
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:49,439
is to go to my like boxing gym

1601
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:50,079
and and box with a guy right like that's

1602
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,720
there's

1603
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,280
there's nothing quite like that physical

1604
00:56:52,719 --> 00:56:55,838
you know

1605
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,720
experience like that's fascinating that

1606
00:56:55,838 --> 00:56:59,039
might be

1607
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:02,318
simply an artifact of the year you were

1608
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:04,639
born maybe because if you're born today

1609
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:05,920
it almost seems like stupid to go to a

1610
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:07,759
gym yeah

1611
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,920
like you're going to a gym to box with a

1612
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,640
guy why not box with mike tyson when you

1613
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:14,960
yourself was like in his prime when you

1614
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:17,679
yourself are also an incredible boxer

1615
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,440
in the video game world for me there

1616
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:21,358
there's a multitude of reasons why i

1617
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,798
don't want to box with mike tyson

1618
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:26,960
right like no no no no you enjoy teeth

1619
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:27,838
and i want to have an ear no but your

1620
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,760
your skills

1621
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:31,199
in this meat space in this physical

1622
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,520
realm is very limited

1623
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:35,279
and takes a lot of work and you're

1624
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:38,000
you're uh you're a musician

1625
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:40,079
uh your incredible scientist you only

1626
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,079
have so much time in the in the day

1627
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,400
but in the video game world you can

1628
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:45,280
expand your capabilities in all kinds of

1629
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,280
dimensions

1630
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:48,720
that you can never have possibly have

1631
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,960
time in the physical world

1632
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:51,759
and so that it doesn't make sense like

1633
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:54,559
to

1634
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:56,240
to be existing to be working your ass

1635
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:59,519
off in the physical world

1636
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:02,318
when you can just be super successful uh

1637
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:04,159
uh in the video game world but i still

1638
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:06,400
you enjoy sucking and stuff

1639
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,279
yeah i i really struggling to get better

1640
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,519
i sure do

1641
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:10,559
i mean i think like these days with

1642
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,440
music music

1643
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,400
is a great example right we just started

1644
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,119
you know

1645
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,079
practicing live uh with my band again

1646
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,119
you know after

1647
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,480
not playing for a year and uh you know

1648
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:25,039
it's just it was terrible

1649
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,679
right which is just kind of a lot of the

1650
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:27,679
nuance

1651
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:29,358
you know a lot of the detail is just

1652
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:32,159
that detail that takes you know

1653
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:32,880
years of collective practice to develop

1654
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:36,078
uh

1655
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,358
it's just lost but it was just an

1656
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,480
incredible amount of fun

1657
00:58:37,358 --> 00:58:42,400
way more fun than all the like studio

1658
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,000
you know sitting around and playing uh

1659
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,119
that i did you know throughout the

1660
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:47,280
entire year

1661
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:48,720
so i think there's something there's

1662
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,680
something intangible

1663
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:53,039
or maybe maybe tangible about being uh

1664
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:56,558
being in person

1665
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:58,239
i i sure hope you're wrong and that

1666
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:00,319
you know we that's not something that

1667
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:02,719
will get lost because i think there's

1668
00:59:00,318 --> 00:59:03,838
like such a large part of the human

1669
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:07,598
condition

1670
00:59:03,838 --> 00:59:10,960
is to hang out if we were doing this

1671
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:14,000
interview on zoom right

1672
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,900
i mean i'd already be i'd already be

1673
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,480
bored out of my mind

1674
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:18,160
[Laughter]

1675
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,599
exactly i mean there's something to that

1676
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,598
i mean i'm almost playing devil's

1677
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:23,200
advocate but at the same time

1678
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,640
you know i'm sure people talk about the

1679
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:26,399
same way at the beginning of the 20th

1680
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:28,879
century about horses

1681
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,079
where they're they are much more

1682
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,599
efficient

1683
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:34,160
they're much uh easier to maintain than

1684
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:35,680
cars

1685
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,440
it doesn't make sense to have you know

1686
00:59:35,679 --> 00:59:38,879
all the ways that cars break down and

1687
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,559
there's not enough infrastructure in

1688
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,480
terms of roads for cars

1689
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:44,000
it doesn't make any sense like horses

1690
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:45,039
and like nature you could do the nature

1691
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,639
like where

1692
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:48,159
you know you should be living more

1693
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:49,679
natural life those are real you don't

1694
00:59:48,159 --> 00:59:50,960
want machines in your life they're going

1695
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:52,798
to pollute your mind

1696
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:54,798
and the minds of young people but then

1697
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:56,960
eventually just cars took over so

1698
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:59,358
in that same way it just seems uh going

1699
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:01,599
back to horses

1700
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:02,480
just you know well you can be you can

1701
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,680
play uh

1702
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,679
uh uh what is it red dead

1703
01:00:05,679 --> 01:00:09,039
red dead redemption redemption and uh

1704
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:09,679
you can ride horses in the video game

1705
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:12,880
more

1706
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:15,039
so let me return us back to planet nine

1707
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:17,039
uh-huh always a good place to come back

1708
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:19,279
to so now that we did a big

1709
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:21,039
historical overview of our solar system

1710
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:25,440
what is planet nine

1711
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:27,920
okay planet nine is a hypothetical

1712
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,798
object that orbits the solar system

1713
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:32,559
right at

1714
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:36,079
an orbital period of about 10 000 years

1715
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,680
and an orbit which is slightly tilted

1716
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:38,559
with respect to the plane of the solar

1717
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:41,759
system

1718
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:45,519
slightly eccentric and the object itself

1719
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:48,799
we think is five times more massive than

1720
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:52,000
the earth we have never seen planet nine

1721
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:53,358
in a telescope but we have gravitational

1722
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,440
evidence for it

1723
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:57,838
and so this is where all the stuff we've

1724
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,920
been talking about this clustering ideas

1725
01:00:57,838 --> 01:01:01,279
maybe you can speak to the approximate

1726
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,280
location that we

1727
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,040
suspect and also the question i wanted

1728
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:06,640
to ask is uh

1729
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:08,558
what are we supposed to be imagining

1730
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:10,000
here because he said there's certain

1731
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,480
objects in the kuiper belt that

1732
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,280
are kind of have a direction to them

1733
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,079
that they're all

1734
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:17,519
like like flocking in some kind of way

1735
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,200
so that's the sense that there's some

1736
01:01:17,519 --> 01:01:21,920
kind of gravitational object

1737
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:22,798
not changing their orbit but kind of

1738
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,639
confining them

1739
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:26,000
right yeah finding like grouping their

1740
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,759
orbits together

1741
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,000
see what would happen if planet nine

1742
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:31,040
were not there is these orbits that

1743
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,559
roughly share

1744
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:37,199
a common orientation they would just

1745
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,480
disperse right they would just become as

1746
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:42,558
a mutually symmetric

1747
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:45,599
point everywhere planet nine's gravity

1748
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:47,280
makes it such that these objects stay

1749
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:50,160
in a state that's that's basically

1750
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:53,519
anti-aligned with respect to the orb

1751
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:55,598
of planet nine um and

1752
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:57,038
and sort of hang out there and kind of

1753
01:01:55,599 --> 01:01:58,400
oscillate on time scale of about a

1754
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:01,839
billion years

1755
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,680
that's one of the lines of evidence for

1756
01:02:01,838 --> 01:02:05,279
the existence of planet nine there are

1757
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:07,199
others that's the one that's easiest to

1758
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:09,039
maybe visualize just because it's fun to

1759
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:12,798
think about orbits that all point

1760
01:02:09,039 --> 01:02:15,280
into the same direction but i should

1761
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:16,318
you know emphasize that for example the

1762
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:19,119
existence of

1763
01:02:16,318 --> 01:02:20,719
objects again kuiper belt objects that

1764
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:22,079
are heavily out of the plane

1765
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:25,598
of the solar system things that are

1766
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:28,640
tilted by say 90 degrees that's not

1767
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:30,559
we don't expect that as an outcome

1768
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:31,838
of planet formation indeed planet

1769
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,160
formation

1770
01:02:31,838 --> 01:02:35,519
simulations have never produced such

1771
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:38,239
objects

1772
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:38,880
without some extrinsic gravitational

1773
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:40,639
force

1774
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,400
planet nine on the other hand generates

1775
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,558
them very readily so that

1776
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:48,880
provides kind of an alternative you know

1777
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:50,960
population of small bodies in the solar

1778
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:51,599
system that also get produced by planet

1779
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,000
9 through an

1780
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:54,880
independent kind of gravitational effect

1781
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:58,318
so they're kind of

1782
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:01,519
there's basically five different things

1783
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:04,639
that the uh that planet nine does

1784
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:07,280
individually that are like kind of

1785
01:03:04,639 --> 01:03:09,199
maybe a one sigma effect where you would

1786
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:10,960
say yeah okay if that's all it was

1787
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:12,639
maybe it's not no reason to jump up and

1788
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,440
down but because

1789
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,078
it's it's mult it's a multitude of these

1790
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:19,838
puzzles

1791
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:22,160
that all are explained by one hypothesis

1792
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:25,199
that's that's really the the magnetism

1793
01:03:22,159 --> 01:03:28,399
the attraction of the planet nine model

1794
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:31,199
so can you just clarify so

1795
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:33,358
most orbit most planets in the solar

1796
01:03:31,199 --> 01:03:35,598
system orbit

1797
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:36,400
and approximately the same so it's flat

1798
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:39,519
yeah it's like

1799
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:40,079
one degree they the difference between

1800
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:42,798
them is

1801
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:44,079
about one degree so but nevertheless if

1802
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:46,318
we looked at our solar

1803
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:47,680
system it would look and i could see

1804
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:48,960
every single object it would look like a

1805
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:51,759
sphere

1806
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,798
the inner part where the planets are

1807
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:55,839
would look

1808
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:56,639
like you know flat right the the kuiper

1809
01:03:55,838 --> 01:04:00,000
belt

1810
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:02,239
and the asteroid belt have a larger

1811
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,519
um it gets fatter and fatter yeah that's

1812
01:04:02,239 --> 01:04:05,598
kind of like becomes a sphere

1813
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:07,759
that's right and if you look at the very

1814
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:10,960
outside it's polluted by this

1815
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:13,440
you know quasi-spheroidal thing

1816
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,240
nobody's of course ever seen the oort

1817
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:17,119
cloud

1818
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:18,479
right we've only seen comments that come

1819
01:04:17,119 --> 01:04:21,358
from the oort cloud so

1820
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,519
the oort cloud which is this right

1821
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:26,558
population of distant debris

1822
01:04:23,519 --> 01:04:26,880
its existence is also inferred you could

1823
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,000
say

1824
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,480
alternatively there is you know there's

1825
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,960
a big

1826
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:34,960
cosmic creature that occasionally you

1827
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,720
know sitting at 20 000 au and

1828
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:38,079
occasionally throws an icy

1829
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:39,919
rock towards the sound like that

1830
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:40,559
spaghetti monster i think it's called

1831
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,000
okay

1832
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:45,359
i mean so it's a mystery in many ways

1833
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,719
but you can kind of infer a bunch of

1834
01:04:45,358 --> 01:04:48,480
things about it

1835
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:49,838
it's by the way both terrifying and

1836
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:51,838
exciting that there's this

1837
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,199
vast darkness all around us that's full

1838
01:04:51,838 --> 01:04:55,920
of objects that are just

1839
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:57,279
throwing just there yeah it's actually

1840
01:04:55,920 --> 01:05:00,400
kind of astonishing right

1841
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:03,119
that we have only

1842
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,000
explored a small fraction of the solar

1843
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,280
system

1844
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:08,400
right that that really kind of baffles

1845
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,319
me because

1846
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,440
uh remember as a student you know

1847
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:13,759
studying physics

1848
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:15,760
you know you do the problem where you

1849
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:16,400
put the earth around the sun you solve

1850
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:19,280
that and

1851
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:20,240
like it's one line of math and you say

1852
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,880
okay well that

1853
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:24,000
surely was figured out by newton so like

1854
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,400
all the interesting stuff

1855
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:31,599
is not in the solar system but that um

1856
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:34,400
it's just plainly not true there are

1857
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,880
there are mysteries in the solar system

1858
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:37,680
that

1859
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,280
are remarkable that we are only now

1860
01:05:37,679 --> 01:05:40,239
starting to just kind of scratch the

1861
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,240
surface of

1862
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:43,919
and some of those objects probably have

1863
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:44,798
some information about the history of

1864
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,880
our solar system

1865
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:47,920
absolutely absolutely like a great

1866
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,480
example is

1867
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,920
uh you know small meteorites right small

1868
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:53,920
meteorites

1869
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:55,680
are melted right they have they're

1870
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,798
differentiated meaning some of the

1871
01:05:55,679 --> 01:06:00,798
uh iron sinks you say

1872
01:05:58,798 --> 01:06:02,400
how can that be because they're so small

1873
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:04,239
that they wouldn't have melted just from

1874
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,200
the heat of their accretion

1875
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:07,759
turns out the fact that the solar nebula

1876
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:09,519
the

1877
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:10,960
the disk that made the planets was

1878
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:13,599
polluted by

1879
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:14,960
aluminum 26 is in itself a remarkable

1880
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,798
thing it means

1881
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,400
the solar system did not form an

1882
01:06:16,798 --> 01:06:21,358
isolation it formed

1883
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:23,519
in a giant cloud of thousands of other

1884
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:26,159
stars that were also forming

1885
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:28,159
some of which were undergoing you know

1886
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:28,798
going through supernova explosions some

1887
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:33,679
of

1888
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:35,759
and releasing these unstable isotopes

1889
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:37,679
that of which we now see kind of the

1890
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,839
traces of

1891
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:41,038
it's so cool do you think it's possible

1892
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:43,519
that life from

1893
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:44,640
other solar systems was injected and

1894
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:47,759
that that was

1895
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:50,798
what was uh the origin of life on earth

1896
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:52,480
yeah defense permea idea um

1897
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:54,239
that's seen as a low probability event

1898
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:55,760
by people who studied the original life

1899
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:59,038
but that's because

1900
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,400
uh then they would be out of a job well

1901
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:01,760
i don't think they'd be out of the job

1902
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,200
because you just then say you have to

1903
01:07:01,760 --> 01:07:05,280
figure out how life started

1904
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:06,399
and there but then you have to go there

1905
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:08,400
we can study

1906
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:09,519
life on earth much easier we could study

1907
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:11,599
in the lab

1908
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:12,880
much easier because we could replicate

1909
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,400
conditions that are

1910
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:17,920
from an early earth much easier

1911
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,599
from a chemistry perspective from a

1912
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:21,358
biology perspective

1913
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:23,119
you can intuit a bunch of stuff you can

1914
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:23,519
look at different parts of earth and

1915
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:26,480
just

1916
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:27,199
to an extent i mean the early earth was

1917
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,798
completely

1918
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:30,558
unlike the current earth right there was

1919
01:07:28,798 --> 01:07:33,838
no oxygen so

1920
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:36,960
uh one of my colleagues at caltech uh

1921
01:07:33,838 --> 01:07:40,078
joe kirchnick is

1922
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:43,119
certain right something like

1923
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:46,160
100 certainty that life started on mars

1924
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:47,200
and came to earth uh in on martian media

1925
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:50,239
rights

1926
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:53,598
um this is not a problem

1927
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:55,598
that i like to kind of

1928
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:57,760
think about too much like the origin of

1929
01:07:55,599 --> 01:08:00,720
life it's a fascinating problem

1930
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,440
but you know it's not physics and i just

1931
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:04,159
like

1932
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,960
i just don't don't love it it's the same

1933
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,440
reason you don't love

1934
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,119
i thought you're a musician so music is

1935
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:10,079
not physics either so why are you

1936
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,539
showing 100

1937
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,280
physics

1938
01:08:10,539 --> 01:08:15,679
[Laughter]

1939
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,560
okay no no look uh in all seriousness

1940
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:19,759
though i

1941
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:20,798
uh there are a few things that i really

1942
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,920
really enjoy

1943
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:24,798
i genuinely enjoy physics i genuinely

1944
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,399
enjoy music

1945
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:28,719
i genuinely you know enjoy martial arts

1946
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:31,599
and

1947
01:08:28,719 --> 01:08:33,520
i genuinely enjoy uh my family i should

1948
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:34,239
have said that all in a reverse order or

1949
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:37,040
something

1950
01:08:34,238 --> 01:08:38,079
but i like to focus on these things and

1951
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:39,838
not worry too much

1952
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:41,838
about about everything else you know

1953
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:44,079
what i mean yes just because there is a

1954
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:46,079
like you said earlier there's a time

1955
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:48,479
constraint you can't

1956
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:49,278
do it all there's many mysteries all

1957
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:52,318
around us

1958
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,199
so um and they're all beautiful in in

1959
01:08:52,319 --> 01:08:55,359
different ways

1960
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:57,519
to me that thing i love is artificial

1961
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:59,520
intelligence that uh

1962
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:00,719
perhaps i love it because eventually i'm

1963
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,920
trying to suck up to our future

1964
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:05,439
overlords

1965
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:07,279
the the question of you said there's a

1966
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:09,198
lot of kind of

1967
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:11,279
little pieces of evidence for this thing

1968
01:09:09,198 --> 01:09:13,119
that's planet nine

1969
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:14,480
if we were to try to collect more

1970
01:09:13,119 --> 01:09:18,000
evidence

1971
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:21,838
or be certain like a paper that says

1972
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:23,359
like you drop it clear we're done

1973
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:25,278
what what is that required does that

1974
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,640
require us sending probes out

1975
01:09:25,279 --> 01:09:28,880
or do you think we can do it from

1976
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:30,798
telescopes here on earth what are the

1977
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:31,920
different ideas for conclusive evidence

1978
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:35,119
for planet nine

1979
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,960
the moment planet nine gets imaged from

1980
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:37,838
a telescope on earth it's done i mean

1981
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:39,359
it's just there

1982
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:40,960
can you clarify because you mentioned

1983
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:43,838
that before from an

1984
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,319
image would you be able to tell yes so

1985
01:09:43,838 --> 01:09:48,079
from

1986
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:50,640
an image the moment you see

1987
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:51,359
something something that is reflecting

1988
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:55,760
sunlight

1989
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:59,199
back at you and you know that it's

1990
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:02,320
hundreds of times as far away from

1991
01:09:59,198 --> 01:10:04,238
the sun as as the earth you're done

1992
01:10:02,319 --> 01:10:06,960
so you're thinking so basically if you

1993
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:08,399
have a really far away thing that's big

1994
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:11,279
yeah you know five times the size of

1995
01:10:08,399 --> 01:10:13,920
earth that means

1996
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:15,519
uh that that's fine that is planet could

1997
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:16,079
there be multiple objects like that i

1998
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,040
guess

1999
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:20,880
in principle yeah i mean there's no

2000
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:22,399
there's no law of physics that uh that

2001
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:24,800
doesn't allow you to have multiple

2002
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:26,319
there's also no evidence at present for

2003
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:27,760
there being multiple i wonder if

2004
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:29,679
it's possible this is like just like

2005
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,239
we're finding exoplanets

2006
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,279
whether given the size of the or cloud

2007
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:35,919
there's basically

2008
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:37,039
it's rare and rare but they're sprinkled

2009
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:40,480
planet nine

2010
01:10:37,039 --> 01:10:43,920
ten eleven twelve like these yeah

2011
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:45,039
some got thirteen after that yeah i can

2012
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,199
just keep counting

2013
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:48,238
so like just something about the dynamic

2014
01:10:47,198 --> 01:10:49,678
system

2015
01:10:48,238 --> 01:10:51,919
like it becomes lower and lower

2016
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:54,158
probability event but they gather up

2017
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,679
like they they become would they become

2018
01:10:54,158 --> 01:10:58,000
larger and larger maybe

2019
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,960
something like that and i wonder i

2020
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:02,640
wonder if like discovering planet nine

2021
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:04,239
will just like be almost like a

2022
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:06,079
springboard it's like well what's

2023
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:08,319
what's beyond that it's entirely

2024
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:10,960
plausible the oort cloud itself

2025
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:13,519
probably holds about five earth masses

2026
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:17,439
or seven earth masses of material

2027
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:20,960
right so it's not it's not nothing and

2028
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:25,198
the it all ultimately comes down

2029
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,960
to at what point will the observational

2030
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:29,919
surveys

2031
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,480
sample enough of the solar system to uh

2032
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,679
kind of

2033
01:11:30,479 --> 01:11:35,519
reveal interesting things

2034
01:11:33,679 --> 01:11:37,440
there's a great analogy here with

2035
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,239
neptune and the story of how neptune was

2036
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:40,719
discovered

2037
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,678
neptune was not discovered by looking at

2038
01:11:40,719 --> 01:11:44,000
the sky

2039
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:45,279
right it was discovered by uh it was

2040
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,800
certain mathematically

2041
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:52,238
right so yeah the orbit of

2042
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:55,679
uranus when uranus was found um

2043
01:11:52,238 --> 01:11:58,319
yes this was 1781. uh it's

2044
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:58,880
the kind of tracking uh both the

2045
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:01,039
tracking

2046
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:02,159
of the orbit of uranus as well as the

2047
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:04,479
reconstruction

2048
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:05,599
of the orbit of uranus immediately

2049
01:12:04,479 --> 01:12:08,399
revealed

2050
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,440
that it was not following the orbit that

2051
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:11,679
it was supposed to

2052
01:12:09,439 --> 01:12:13,759
right the the predicted orbit deviated

2053
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:17,440
away from where it actually was

2054
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:20,000
so uh in the mid eighteen hundreds

2055
01:12:17,439 --> 01:12:22,399
right um a french mathematician by the

2056
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:24,960
name of orban le verrier

2057
01:12:22,399 --> 01:12:26,479
did a beautifully sophisticated

2058
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:30,079
calculation which said

2059
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:32,399
if this is due to gravity of a

2060
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:33,279
more distant planet then that planet is

2061
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:35,920
there

2062
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,800
okay and then they found it but the

2063
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,239
point is the

2064
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:42,880
understanding of where to look for

2065
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:43,519
neptune came entirely out of celestial

2066
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,000
mechanics

2067
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:46,800
the case with planet nine is a little

2068
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,800
bit different

2069
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:50,960
because what we can do i think

2070
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,960
relatively well is predict the orbit and

2071
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:54,640
mass of planet nine we cannot tell you

2072
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:57,039
where it is on its orbit

2073
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,880
the reason is we haven't seen the kuiper

2074
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:01,920
belt objects complete

2075
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,679
in orbit their own orbit

2076
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,039
even once because it takes four thousand

2077
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:07,840
years but

2078
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:08,560
you know i plan to live on as an ai

2079
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:11,199
being

2080
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,679
uh and you know i'll i'll be tracking

2081
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:13,919
those

2082
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:15,359
uh those orbits as solid takes four or

2083
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,480
five thousand years i mean

2084
01:13:15,359 --> 01:13:17,839
it doesn't have to be ai it could be

2085
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:19,759
longevity there's a lot of really

2086
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:21,840
exciting genetic engineering research

2087
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,119
so you'll just be a brain waiting for

2088
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,279
the

2089
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:27,039
for the your brain waiting for the orbit

2090
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:27,759
to complete for the basic kuiper belt

2091
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,238
objects

2092
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,440
that's that's right that's like kind of

2093
01:13:30,238 --> 01:13:34,158
the worst

2094
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:35,839
reason to want to live a long time right

2095
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:36,960
just like can the brain like smoke a

2096
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,119
cigarette

2097
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,239
can you just like light one up while

2098
01:13:39,119 --> 01:13:41,050
you're waiting or

2099
01:13:40,238 --> 01:13:43,759
uh

2100
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:45,279
[Laughter]

2101
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:49,679
but you're making me actually realize

2102
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:52,800
that the one way to explore

2103
01:13:49,679 --> 01:13:54,399
the the galaxy is by just sitting here

2104
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:55,920
on earth and waiting

2105
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:58,639
so if we can just get really good at

2106
01:13:55,920 --> 01:14:00,000
waiting it's like a more more or these

2107
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,000
interstellar objects that

2108
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:03,920
fly in you can just wait for them to

2109
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,279
come to you same with the aliens you can

2110
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,000
wait for them to come to you

2111
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:09,119
if you get really good at waiting um

2112
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,719
then

2113
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:12,079
that's one way to do the exploration

2114
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,359
because eventually the thing will come

2115
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:15,600
to you maybe that's the entire

2116
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:16,960
maybe the intelligent alien

2117
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:19,120
civilizations

2118
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:20,239
get much better at waiting and so they

2119
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:21,760
all decide so

2120
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:23,439
game theoretically to start waiting and

2121
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,520
it's just a bunch of like

2122
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:27,279
ancient intelligent civilizations of

2123
01:14:25,520 --> 01:14:28,640
aliens all throughout the universe

2124
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:29,279
they're just sitting there waiting for

2125
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,600
each other

2126
01:14:29,279 --> 01:14:32,960
look you can't just be good at waiting

2127
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,120
you got to know how to chill

2128
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,800
okay like like you can't just like sit

2129
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:38,319
around and do nothing you got to be

2130
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,000
you get you got to know how to chill i

2131
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:42,399
honestly think that

2132
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,439
as we progress if the aliens are

2133
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:46,719
anything like us

2134
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:49,119
we enjoy loving things we do

2135
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:51,679
and it it's uh it's very possible that

2136
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:54,000
we just figure out mechanisms

2137
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:55,760
here on earth to enjoy our life and we

2138
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:58,399
just stay here on our f

2139
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:00,159
forever that exploration becomes less

2140
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:03,279
and less of an interesting thing to do

2141
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:04,960
and so you basically yes wait and chill

2142
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:06,479
you get really optimally good at

2143
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:09,840
chilling and thereby

2144
01:15:06,479 --> 01:15:10,479
exploring is not that interesting so you

2145
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,319
know

2146
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:13,839
in terms of 4 000 years would be nothing

2147
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:14,319
for scientists we'll be chilling and

2148
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:16,880
just

2149
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:17,519
all kinds of scientific explorations

2150
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:21,520
will become

2151
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,520
possible because we'll just be here

2152
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:25,280
you have a paper out recently because

2153
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:26,000
you already mentioned some of these

2154
01:15:25,279 --> 01:15:27,439
ideas but

2155
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:29,439
i'd love it if you could dig into it a

2156
01:15:27,439 --> 01:15:30,158
little bit yeah of course the injection

2157
01:15:29,439 --> 01:15:32,719
of inner

2158
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:34,799
or cloud objects into the distant kuiper

2159
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:38,319
belt by planet nine

2160
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:40,079
what is this idea of

2161
01:15:38,319 --> 01:15:42,399
planet nine injecting objects into the

2162
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:45,439
kuiper belt okay let me take a

2163
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:46,639
brief step back and when we do

2164
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,678
calculations of

2165
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:52,400
planet nine we do the simulations

2166
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,880
as far as our simulations are concerned

2167
01:15:52,399 --> 01:15:56,879
sort of

2168
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:59,679
the uh neptune

2169
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:00,560
like kind of the trans-neptunian solar

2170
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:03,840
system

2171
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:07,039
is entirely sourced from the inside

2172
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:09,119
namely the kuiper belt gets scattered by

2173
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:11,039
neptune and then planet nine does things

2174
01:16:09,119 --> 01:16:14,079
to it and aligns the orbits and

2175
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:15,600
and so on and then we calculate what uh

2176
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:18,238
what happens on the lifetime of the

2177
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,239
solar system yada yada

2178
01:16:18,238 --> 01:16:21,759
during the pandemic one of the kind of

2179
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:23,519
questions we asked

2180
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:25,360
ourselves this is indeed something we

2181
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,280
mike and i uh

2182
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,039
mike brown whose partner in crime on

2183
01:16:27,279 --> 01:16:33,039
this and i

2184
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:36,560
do regularly is we say how can

2185
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:39,279
we a disprove ourselves and b

2186
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:40,719
how can we improve our simulations like

2187
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:43,920
what's missing

2188
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:46,000
one idea that maybe should have been

2189
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,000
obvious in retrospect is that all of our

2190
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:50,800
simulations treated the solar system

2191
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:53,039
as some isolated creature right but the

2192
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,760
solar system did not form in isolation

2193
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:57,679
right it formed in this cluster of stars

2194
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,920
and during that phase

2195
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:01,039
of forming together with thousands of

2196
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,239
other stars

2197
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:06,880
we believe the solar system formed this

2198
01:17:04,238 --> 01:17:08,000
almost spherical population of icy

2199
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:11,520
debris

2200
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:14,960
that sits maybe at a

2201
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:16,320
few thousand times the separation

2202
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,158
between

2203
01:17:16,319 --> 01:17:20,158
the earth and the sun maybe even a

2204
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:22,639
little bit closer

2205
01:17:20,158 --> 01:17:24,639
if planet nine's not there that

2206
01:17:22,640 --> 01:17:27,760
population is completely dormant

2207
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:30,880
and these objects just slowly orbit

2208
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:32,960
the the sun nothing interesting had

2209
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:35,199
happens to them ever but what we

2210
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,119
realized that if planet nine is there

2211
01:17:35,198 --> 01:17:38,639
planet nine can actually grab some of

2212
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,079
those objects and gravitationally

2213
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,880
re-inject them

2214
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:44,559
into the distant solar system so we

2215
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:46,960
thought okay let's look into this

2216
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,920
with numerical experiments do do our

2217
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,480
simulations

2218
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:51,760
does this process work and if it works

2219
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:53,359
uh

2220
01:17:51,760 --> 01:17:55,840
what are its consequences so it turns

2221
01:17:53,359 --> 01:18:00,559
out indeed not only

2222
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:02,880
does planet nine inject these distant

2223
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:03,600
inner or cloud objects into the kuiper

2224
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,960
belt

2225
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:07,679
they follow roughly the same pathway as

2226
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:09,600
the

2227
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:11,520
um as the objects that are being

2228
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:14,960
scattered out also there's this

2229
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:17,280
kind of river two-way river of material

2230
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:19,039
some of it is coming out from you know

2231
01:18:17,279 --> 01:18:22,000
by neptune scattering some of it is

2232
01:18:19,039 --> 01:18:23,198
moving in and if you work through the

2233
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:26,000
numbers

2234
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:26,238
you kind of at the end of the day that

2235
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:28,640
it

2236
01:18:26,238 --> 01:18:29,919
it has an effect on the best fit orbit

2237
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:32,480
for planet nine itself

2238
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,760
so if you realize that the data set that

2239
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,158
we're observing

2240
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,760
is not entirely composed of things that

2241
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:38,559
came out of the solar system but also

2242
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:41,440
things that got

2243
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,960
re-injected back in then turns out the

2244
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:43,839
best fit planet nine slightly more

2245
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:45,679
eccentric

2246
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,000
that's kind of getting into the weeds

2247
01:18:45,679 --> 01:18:50,560
the the point here is that

2248
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,238
uh you know the existence of planet nine

2249
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:54,560
itself provides this

2250
01:18:52,238 --> 01:18:56,559
natural bridge that connects an

2251
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,080
otherwise dormant population of icy

2252
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,360
debris of the solar system

2253
01:18:58,079 --> 01:19:01,279
with things that we're starting to

2254
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:02,960
directly observe so you can flow back so

2255
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:03,279
it's not just the river flowing one way

2256
01:19:02,960 --> 01:19:05,840
it's

2257
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:06,559
maybe a smaller stream go back and

2258
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,840
backwash

2259
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,760
you want a backwash you want to

2260
01:19:07,840 --> 01:19:10,319
incorporate that into the simulations

2261
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:12,480
into your

2262
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:14,000
understanding of those distant objects

2263
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:15,919
when you're trying to make sense of the

2264
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:17,439
various observations and so on exactly

2265
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:20,840
that's fascinating

2266
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:23,759
i gotta ask you some people think that

2267
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,480
uh many of the observations you're

2268
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:28,079
describing

2269
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:29,039
could be described by a primordial black

2270
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:31,119
hole

2271
01:19:29,039 --> 01:19:32,560
first what is the primordial black hole

2272
01:19:31,119 --> 01:19:33,279
and what do you think about this idea

2273
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:36,400
yeah

2274
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:37,198
so primordial black hole is a black hole

2275
01:19:36,399 --> 01:19:39,599
which is made

2276
01:19:37,198 --> 01:19:41,759
not through the usual pathway of making

2277
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:44,320
a black hole

2278
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,600
which is that you have a star which is

2279
01:19:44,319 --> 01:19:49,920
uh more massive

2280
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:51,920
than you know 1.4 or so solar masses and

2281
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:55,199
basically when it runs out of

2282
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:56,079
fuel uh runs out of its nuclear fusion

2283
01:19:55,198 --> 01:19:58,559
fuel

2284
01:19:56,079 --> 01:20:01,279
it can't hold itself up anymore and just

2285
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:04,640
the whole thing collapses on itself

2286
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:07,599
right you create a um

2287
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,719
i mean one i guess simple way to think

2288
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,520
about it is you create an

2289
01:20:08,719 --> 01:20:12,880
object with zero radius that has mass

2290
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:16,320
but zero radius

2291
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:19,359
that singularity

2292
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:21,039
now that's such black holes exist all

2293
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:21,839
over the place in the galaxy there's in

2294
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:23,519
fact

2295
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:25,440
a really big one at the center of the

2296
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,360
galaxy that's like yeah

2297
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:28,638
that that one's always looking at you

2298
01:20:27,359 --> 01:20:31,119
when you're not looking

2299
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:31,679
okay right and it's it's always talking

2300
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:33,840
about you

2301
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,719
and when you turn off the lights it's it

2302
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,000
wakes up

2303
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:38,880
that's right um but you know so such

2304
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:40,719
black holes

2305
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:42,159
are all over the place we when they

2306
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:43,920
merge we get to see

2307
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:45,439
you know incredible gravitational waves

2308
01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,840
that they emit etc etc

2309
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:48,559
one kind of plausible scenario however

2310
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,719
is that

2311
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:52,480
when the universe was forming basically

2312
01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:55,840
during the big bang

2313
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:57,439
you created a whole spectrum of black

2314
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:59,920
holes

2315
01:20:57,439 --> 01:21:01,119
some with masses of five earth masses

2316
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:03,840
some with masses of

2317
01:21:01,119 --> 01:21:05,039
10 earth masses like the entire you know

2318
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:08,800
mass spectrum size

2319
01:21:05,039 --> 01:21:12,000
the amount some the mass of asteroids

2320
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,039
now on the smaller end over the lifetime

2321
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,679
of the universe

2322
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:17,279
the small ones kind of evaporate and

2323
01:21:15,679 --> 01:21:18,639
they're not there anymore at least this

2324
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:21,679
is what we

2325
01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:23,520
what the calculations tell us but five

2326
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:27,279
earth masses is big enough to

2327
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:30,560
not have evaporated so one idea is that

2328
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:32,000
planet nine is not a planet and instead

2329
01:21:30,560 --> 01:21:35,440
it is a five

2330
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:39,119
earth mass black hole and that's why

2331
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:39,119
it's hard to find now

2332
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:43,198
can we right away from our calculations

2333
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,560
say

2334
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:46,719
that's definitely true or that's not

2335
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:48,400
true absolutely not we can't in fact our

2336
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:52,158
calculations

2337
01:21:48,399 --> 01:21:55,439
tell you nothing other than the orbit

2338
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:57,519
and the mass and that means the

2339
01:21:55,439 --> 01:21:58,799
black hole i mean it could be a five

2340
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,280
earth mass you know

2341
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:03,279
cup it could be a five earth mass

2342
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:05,279
hedgehog or a black hole or

2343
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:07,759
really anything that's five earth masses

2344
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:08,559
will do because the gravity of a black

2345
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:10,480
hole

2346
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:12,800
is no different than the gravity of a

2347
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:14,559
planet right if the sun became a black

2348
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,800
hole tomorrow

2349
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,320
it would be dark but or the earth would

2350
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,719
keep orbiting it

2351
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:21,840
and like this notion that oh black holes

2352
01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:24,000
suck everything in

2353
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,360
it's it's not that's like a sci-fi

2354
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,960
notion right it's just mass

2355
01:22:25,359 --> 01:22:29,439
what would be the difference between a

2356
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:32,079
black hole and a planet

2357
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:34,000
in terms of observationally uh

2358
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:36,158
observationally the difference would be

2359
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:38,880
that you will never find the black hole

2360
01:22:36,158 --> 01:22:39,519
right the truth is they're kind of um

2361
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:42,639
i'm actually

2362
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,600
not you know i never looked into this

2363
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:46,800
very carefully

2364
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,760
but there are some constraints that you

2365
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,400
can

2366
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,199
get just statistically say okay if the

2367
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:53,359
sun

2368
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:55,439
has a binary companion which is a five

2369
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:58,000
earth mass black hole

2370
01:22:55,439 --> 01:22:59,119
then that means such black holes would

2371
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,439
be extremely

2372
01:22:59,119 --> 01:23:03,359
common and you know you can sort of look

2373
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:05,039
for lensing events and then you say okay

2374
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:07,519
maybe that's not so likely

2375
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:08,479
but you know that said i want to

2376
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,280
emphasize that

2377
01:23:08,479 --> 01:23:11,919
there's a limit to what our calculations

2378
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:13,679
uh

2379
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:15,199
can tell you that's the orbit and the

2380
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,279
mass so

2381
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:18,399
i think there's a bunch like ed whitton

2382
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:21,119
i think

2383
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:22,719
wishes it's a black hole because i think

2384
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:23,198
the one exciting things about black

2385
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:25,840
holes

2386
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:26,559
in our solar system is that we can go

2387
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:28,800
there

2388
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:30,480
and we can maybe study the singularity

2389
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,000
somehow because that allows us to

2390
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:33,119
understand some fundamental things about

2391
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,560
physics

2392
01:23:33,119 --> 01:23:38,880
if um it's a planet so planet nine

2393
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:39,920
we may not you know and we go there we

2394
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:43,039
may not discover

2395
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,639
anything profoundly new

2396
01:23:43,039 --> 01:23:46,319
the interesting thing perhaps you can

2397
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:48,800
correct me about planet nine

2398
01:23:46,319 --> 01:23:50,880
is like the big picture of it the whole

2399
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,079
big story of the kuiper belt and all

2400
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,159
those kinds of things

2401
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:56,000
it's not that planet nine would be

2402
01:23:54,158 --> 01:24:00,158
somehow fundamentally different

2403
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:02,560
from um from i don't know neptune

2404
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:04,079
in terms of um in terms of the kind of

2405
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,400
things we can learn from it so i think

2406
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:06,158
that

2407
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:08,158
there's kind of a hope that it's a black

2408
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:09,679
hole because it's an entirely new kind

2409
01:24:08,158 --> 01:24:13,039
of object maybe you can

2410
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:14,000
uh correct me yeah i mean of course here

2411
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:16,560
my own

2412
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:17,039
biases creep in because i'm interested

2413
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:20,080
you know

2414
01:24:17,039 --> 01:24:23,039
in planets around other stars and

2415
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:24,559
i would say i would disagree that you

2416
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:27,679
know we wouldn't find

2417
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:30,639
things that would be truly you know

2418
01:24:27,679 --> 01:24:31,679
fundamentally new new because as it

2419
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:35,039
turns out

2420
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:38,399
the the galaxy is really good at making

2421
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:42,000
five or three earth mass objects right

2422
01:24:38,399 --> 01:24:44,799
the most common type of planet that we

2423
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,920
see that we you know discover orbiting

2424
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:48,079
around other stars

2425
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:49,679
there's a few earth masses in the solar

2426
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:51,519
system there's no analog for that

2427
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:52,719
right we go from one earth mass object

2428
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:55,840
which is this one

2429
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:57,760
and to skipping to neptune and uranus

2430
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:59,760
which themselves are actually relatively

2431
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,360
poorly understood

2432
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:03,679
especially uranus from the interior

2433
01:25:01,359 --> 01:25:06,880
structure point of view

2434
01:25:03,679 --> 01:25:08,960
if planet nine is a planet going there

2435
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,239
will give us the closest window and to

2436
01:25:08,960 --> 01:25:14,560
understanding what

2437
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:16,718
other planets look like and um

2438
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,840
i will you know i'll say this that you

2439
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:19,760
know planets

2440
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:21,840
kind of in terms of their complexity on

2441
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,560
some logarithmic scale

2442
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:25,520
fall somewhere between a star and an

2443
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:28,880
insect

2444
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:29,920
right an insect is way more complicated

2445
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:32,800
than a star

2446
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:34,319
right just there's all kinds of physical

2447
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:37,039
processes and really

2448
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:38,479
biochemical processes that occur inside

2449
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:41,519
of an insect

2450
01:25:38,479 --> 01:25:43,678
that just make a star look like

2451
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:45,040
you know somebody is like playing with

2452
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:48,480
the spring or something yeah

2453
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:51,840
right so the i i think

2454
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:55,359
you know it would be you know arguably

2455
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:57,440
you know more interesting to go to um

2456
01:25:55,359 --> 01:25:59,119
you know to go to planet nine if it's a

2457
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:00,399
planet because black holes are simple

2458
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:03,599
they're just kind of

2459
01:26:00,399 --> 01:26:06,638
they're basically macroscopic like

2460
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:08,320
particles yeah right and so just like

2461
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:10,560
you mentioned in terms of complexity so

2462
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:12,479
it's possible that planet nine

2463
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:13,600
as opposed to being like homogeneous is

2464
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:15,439
like super

2465
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,719
like heterogeneous is a bunch of cool

2466
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:18,479
stuff going on absolutely

2467
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:20,079
that could give us an intuition i never

2468
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:22,959
thought about that that it's

2469
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:24,079
basically earth number two in terms of

2470
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:26,399
size

2471
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:28,719
and gives us starts giving us intuition

2472
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:30,719
that could be generalizable to

2473
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:32,399
earth-like planets elsewhere in the

2474
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:35,119
galaxy yeah pluto

2475
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:38,000
is also in the sense like you know pluto

2476
01:26:35,119 --> 01:26:39,519
is a tiny tiny thing right just like

2477
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:41,520
you would imagine there's just a tiny

2478
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:42,320
ball of ice like who cares but the new

2479
01:26:41,520 --> 01:26:45,199
horizons

2480
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:46,880
images of pluto reveal so much

2481
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:49,279
remarkable structure

2482
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:50,079
right they reveal glaciers flowing and

2483
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:52,000
these are glaciers

2484
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:53,198
not made out of water ice but you know

2485
01:26:52,000 --> 01:26:56,479
co ice

2486
01:26:53,198 --> 01:27:00,079
it turns out at those temperatures

2487
01:26:56,479 --> 01:27:02,158
right of like 40 or so kelvin water ice

2488
01:27:00,079 --> 01:27:03,198
looks like metal right it doesn't flow

2489
01:27:02,158 --> 01:27:06,559
at all but then

2490
01:27:03,198 --> 01:27:08,158
ice made up of carbon monoxide

2491
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,639
starts to flow i mean there's just like

2492
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:13,839
all kinds of really cool

2493
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:17,039
uh phenomena that you otherwise just

2494
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:19,600
wouldn't really even imagine that occur

2495
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:21,359
so yeah i mean there's a reason why i

2496
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:25,120
like planets

2497
01:27:21,359 --> 01:27:28,000
well let me ask you i find uh

2498
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:29,439
as i read the idea that edwin was

2499
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,520
thinking about this kind of stuff

2500
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:33,439
fascinating so he he's a mathematical

2501
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,360
physicist

2502
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:37,439
who's uh very interested in string

2503
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:41,279
theory won the fields

2504
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:43,919
metal for his work in mathematics

2505
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:44,559
so i read that he proposed a fleet of

2506
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:47,039
probes

2507
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:49,199
accelerated by radiation pressure that

2508
01:27:47,039 --> 01:27:52,079
could discover a planet nine primordial

2509
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:53,759
black holes location

2510
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:56,000
uh what do you think about this idea of

2511
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:59,840
sending a bunch of probes out there

2512
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,399
yeah look the way the the idea is a cool

2513
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:03,600
one

2514
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:05,359
right you go and you say

2515
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:07,920
you know launch them basically

2516
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:10,960
isotropically you track where they go

2517
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:13,520
and uh if i understand the idea

2518
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:15,679
correctly you basically measure the

2519
01:28:13,520 --> 01:28:16,639
deflection and then you say okay there

2520
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:19,679
must be

2521
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:21,760
something there since the the

2522
01:28:19,679 --> 01:28:22,719
probe trajectories are being altered oh

2523
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:25,440
so the measurement

2524
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:27,198
the basic sensory mechanism is the it's

2525
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:29,119
not like you have sensors on the probes

2526
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:30,879
it's more like you're

2527
01:28:29,119 --> 01:28:33,039
because you're very precisely able to

2528
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:34,079
capture to measure the trajectory of the

2529
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:35,840
probes you can then

2530
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:38,559
infer the gravitational fields and i

2531
01:28:35,840 --> 01:28:42,000
think i think that's the basic idea

2532
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:45,039
um you know back a few years ago we

2533
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:48,560
had conversations like these with um

2534
01:28:45,039 --> 01:28:51,679
you know engineers from jpl they

2535
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:53,520
more or less convinced me that this is

2536
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:54,880
much more difficult than it seems

2537
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:57,280
because

2538
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:58,560
you don't at that level of precision

2539
01:28:57,279 --> 01:29:00,639
right

2540
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:01,600
things like solar flares matter right

2541
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,159
solar flares

2542
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,600
right are completely chaotic you can't

2543
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:07,279
predict which

2544
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:08,960
where a solar flare will happen that

2545
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:11,119
will drive radiation

2546
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:13,520
pressure gradients you don't know where

2547
01:29:11,119 --> 01:29:17,359
every single asteroid is so like

2548
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:19,679
actually doing that problem

2549
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:20,799
i think it's possible but it's it's not

2550
01:29:19,679 --> 01:29:24,000
a trivial matter

2551
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:26,560
right well i wonder not just about

2552
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:27,760
planet nine i wonder if that's kind of

2553
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,800
the future

2554
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:32,719
of doing science in our solar system

2555
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:34,239
is to just launch a huge number of

2556
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:36,800
probes so like a

2557
01:29:34,238 --> 01:29:38,559
whole order of magnitude many orders of

2558
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,960
magnitude larger

2559
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:42,320
numbers of probes and then starting for

2560
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:44,719
a bunch of different stuff

2561
01:29:42,319 --> 01:29:45,679
not just gravity but everything else so

2562
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:47,600
in this regard

2563
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,520
i actually think there is a huge

2564
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:52,159
revolution that's

2565
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:53,440
to some extent already started right the

2566
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:55,839
standard kind of like

2567
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:56,719
time scale for a nasa mission is that

2568
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,360
you like

2569
01:29:56,719 --> 01:29:59,840
propose it and it launches i don't know

2570
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:02,399
like

2571
01:29:59,840 --> 01:30:03,520
150 years after you propose i'm over

2572
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:05,759
exaggerating but

2573
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,280
yeah you know it's just like some huge

2574
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:11,280
development cycle

2575
01:30:07,279 --> 01:30:14,479
yeah and it gets delayed 55 times

2576
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:17,279
like that is not going away

2577
01:30:14,479 --> 01:30:18,079
yeah right the the really cutting edge

2578
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:19,679
things

2579
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:21,198
you have to do it this way because you

2580
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:22,000
don't know what you're building so to

2581
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:25,519
speak

2582
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:29,119
but the cubesat kind of world

2583
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:31,120
is starting to um you know provide an

2584
01:30:29,119 --> 01:30:32,719
avenue for like

2585
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:34,399
you know launching something that costs

2586
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:37,198
you know a few million dollars

2587
01:30:34,399 --> 01:30:39,198
and has a turnaround time scale of like

2588
01:30:37,198 --> 01:30:42,399
a couple years you can imagine doing

2589
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:43,039
you know phd theses where you design the

2590
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:44,879
mission

2591
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:46,079
the mission goes to where you're going

2592
01:30:44,880 --> 01:30:49,199
and you do the science

2593
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:53,198
all within a time span of five six years

2594
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:55,439
that is has not been fully executed on

2595
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:57,198
yet but i absolutely think that's on the

2596
01:30:55,439 --> 01:30:59,359
horizon and we're not talking

2597
01:30:57,198 --> 01:31:00,238
a decade i think we're talking like this

2598
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:02,079
decade

2599
01:31:00,238 --> 01:31:03,359
yeah and the company is accelerating all

2600
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:07,359
this uh

2601
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:09,599
with uh blue origin and and uh spacex

2602
01:31:07,359 --> 01:31:11,599
there's a bunch of more cubesat oriented

2603
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:14,320
companies that are pushing this forward

2604
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:16,800
uh well let me ask you let me ask you on

2605
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:20,000
that topic what do you think about

2606
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:22,880
either one elon musk with spacex

2607
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:23,679
uh going to mars i think he wants spacex

2608
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:28,079
to be the first

2609
01:31:23,679 --> 01:31:32,000
to put a first human on mars and then uh

2610
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:33,760
jeff bezos got to give him props

2611
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:35,840
wants to be the first to fly his own

2612
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:38,159
rocket

2613
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:39,840
out into space so you know wasn't there

2614
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:42,799
a guy who like

2615
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:44,079
built his rocket out of garbage yeah

2616
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:46,320
this was like a couple

2617
01:31:44,079 --> 01:31:47,439
years ago and somewhere in the desert he

2618
01:31:46,319 --> 01:31:49,439
launched himself

2619
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:50,559
i'm not tracking this closely but i

2620
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:52,319
think i am

2621
01:31:50,560 --> 01:31:54,480
familiar with folks who built their own

2622
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:55,920
rocket to try to prove the earth is flat

2623
01:31:54,479 --> 01:31:57,599
yes that's the guy i'm talking about

2624
01:31:55,920 --> 01:31:59,359
yeah he was also like he also jumped

2625
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:03,440
some limousine yeah

2626
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:07,279
for truly revolutionary minds

2627
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:10,479
uh greater men than either you or i

2628
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:13,359
but yeah so look it's been

2629
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:14,079
astonishing to watch how really over the

2630
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:17,279
last like

2631
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:20,479
decade the commercial sector

2632
01:32:17,279 --> 01:32:23,039
took over this uh you know

2633
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:23,919
this industry that traditionally has

2634
01:32:23,039 --> 01:32:27,600
really been like

2635
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:29,600
a you know a government thing to do um

2636
01:32:27,600 --> 01:32:31,360
motivated primarily by the the

2637
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,159
competition between nations like the

2638
01:32:31,359 --> 01:32:35,439
cold war

2639
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:38,000
sure and now it's motivated more

2640
01:32:35,439 --> 01:32:39,119
more and more by the natural forces of

2641
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,158
capitalism yes

2642
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:44,079
that's right so um okay here

2643
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:45,359
i have i have many ideas about i think

2644
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:47,760
on the one hand right

2645
01:32:45,359 --> 01:32:49,279
like what spacex has been able to do for

2646
01:32:47,760 --> 01:32:53,360
example phenomenal

2647
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:55,599
um if that brings down

2648
01:32:53,359 --> 01:32:57,198
the price of spacex within that

2649
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:59,920
turnaround time scale for space

2650
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:03,198
exploration which i think it inevitably

2651
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:04,000
will um that's a huge you know that's a

2652
01:33:03,198 --> 01:33:06,879
huge boost

2653
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,279
to the to the human condition the same

2654
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:09,520
time

2655
01:33:07,279 --> 01:33:11,119
right if we're talking astronomy right

2656
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:13,679
there they're also

2657
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:15,679
it comes at a huge cost right and the

2658
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:18,000
starling satellites is a great example

2659
01:33:15,679 --> 01:33:21,039
of that cost right at one point uh

2660
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:22,158
in fact i was just camping and the

2661
01:33:21,039 --> 01:33:24,639
mojave was a

2662
01:33:22,158 --> 01:33:25,198
with a friend of mine and they saw you

2663
01:33:24,639 --> 01:33:27,279
know

2664
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:28,799
this uh the string of satellites just

2665
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:31,679
kind of like

2666
01:33:28,800 --> 01:33:33,119
you know appear and then disappear uh

2667
01:33:31,679 --> 01:33:35,520
into nowhere so that

2668
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:37,679
is beginning to interfere with you know

2669
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:39,840
earth-based observations so

2670
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,960
i think it's there's tremendous

2671
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:42,719
potential there

2672
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:44,880
it's also important to be responsible

2673
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:48,560
about how it's executed

2674
01:33:44,880 --> 01:33:50,639
now with mars and the whole idea of you

2675
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,880
know exploring mars

2676
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:54,639
right i don't have like strong opinions

2677
01:33:52,880 --> 01:33:58,480
on whether a manned mission

2678
01:33:54,639 --> 01:34:02,319
is is required or not required

2679
01:33:58,479 --> 01:34:04,879
um but i do think you know

2680
01:34:02,319 --> 01:34:05,599
we need to focus the thing to keep in

2681
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,719
mind is that

2682
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:10,800
i i generally kind of

2683
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:12,880
uh i'm not signed on if it will to the

2684
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:14,159
idea that mars is some kind of a safe

2685
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,679
haven that we can

2686
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:20,799
uh you know escape to right

2687
01:34:17,679 --> 01:34:21,119
mars sucks right like living on mars if

2688
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:24,239
you

2689
01:34:21,119 --> 01:34:25,599
if you want to live on mars like you can

2690
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:27,678
have that experience

2691
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:30,079
by going to the mojave desert and

2692
01:34:27,679 --> 01:34:32,079
camping and it's just like

2693
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:33,359
it's it's just not a great well it's

2694
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:35,119
interesting but there's something

2695
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:35,519
captivating about that kind of mission

2696
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:39,279
of

2697
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:43,040
us striving out into space and by making

2698
01:34:39,279 --> 01:34:46,079
mars in some ways habitable

2699
01:34:43,039 --> 01:34:47,760
for at least like months at a time

2700
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:49,920
i think would lead to engineering

2701
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:52,239
breakthroughs that would make life

2702
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,760
like in many ways much better on earth

2703
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:56,399
like it would we'll come up with

2704
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:57,920
ideas we totally don't expect yet both

2705
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:01,198
on the robotics side

2706
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:04,239
on the food engineering side on the

2707
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:06,559
you know maybe like we'll switch from

2708
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:08,479
what like there'll be huge breakthroughs

2709
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:11,760
in insect farming as

2710
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:13,678
as exciting as i find that idea to be

2711
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:15,440
that in you know our in the ways we

2712
01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:17,679
consume protein maybe

2713
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:18,559
uh it'll revolutionize we do factory

2714
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,199
farming which is

2715
01:35:18,560 --> 01:35:22,239
full of cruelty and you know and torture

2716
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:24,559
of animals will

2717
01:35:22,238 --> 01:35:25,678
revolutionize that completely because of

2718
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:27,840
our like we don't

2719
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:29,840
we shouldn't need to go to mars to

2720
01:35:27,840 --> 01:35:31,760
revolutionize life here on earth

2721
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:33,440
but at the same time i shouldn't need a

2722
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:35,920
deadline to get done

2723
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:36,638
but i do need it and then the same way i

2724
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:38,480
think we need

2725
01:35:36,639 --> 01:35:40,079
mars there's something about the human

2726
01:35:38,479 --> 01:35:42,479
spirit that loves that

2727
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:44,000
longing for i i agree with that thesis

2728
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:47,359
the going to the moon

2729
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:51,039
right and the that whole

2730
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:53,279
endeavor has you know

2731
01:35:51,039 --> 01:35:55,039
has captivated the imagination of so

2732
01:35:53,279 --> 01:35:57,679
many and it has uh

2733
01:35:55,039 --> 01:35:59,760
it has led to incredible kind of

2734
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,039
incredible ideas really and and probably

2735
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,199
in non-linear ways

2736
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:04,319
right not like okay we went to the moon

2737
01:36:03,198 --> 01:36:06,079
therefore

2738
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:08,559
some person here has thought of this and

2739
01:36:06,079 --> 01:36:11,920
yes in in that similar sense

2740
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:13,440
i think you know space exploration is

2741
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,279
there's something there's some real

2742
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:17,519
magnetism about it

2743
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:18,800
and it's on a genetic level right like

2744
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:21,600
we have this

2745
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,320
need to keep exploring right when we're

2746
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,360
done

2747
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:27,679
uh with a certain frontier we move on to

2748
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:30,319
the next frontier all that i'm saying

2749
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:31,520
is that i'm not moving to mars to live

2750
01:36:30,319 --> 01:36:33,599
there permanently

2751
01:36:31,520 --> 01:36:35,440
uh ever you know and i think that you

2752
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:38,400
know i'm glad you paid

2753
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:39,198
you you noted the kind of degradation of

2754
01:36:38,399 --> 01:36:42,638
the earth

2755
01:36:39,198 --> 01:36:44,960
right i think that is a true kind of

2756
01:36:42,639 --> 01:36:46,000
the leading order challenge of our great

2757
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,679
engineering that's

2758
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,520
a bunch of a bunch of engineering

2759
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:52,639
problems i'm most interested in this

2760
01:36:49,520 --> 01:36:54,320
space because as i've read extensively

2761
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:55,760
it's apparently very difficult to have

2762
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:57,279
sex in space

2763
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:58,800
and so i just want that problem to be

2764
01:36:57,279 --> 01:37:00,960
solved because i think

2765
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,360
once we solve the sex and space problem

2766
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:06,000
we'll revolutionize sex here on earth

2767
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:06,639
thereby increasing the fun on earth and

2768
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:08,479
um

2769
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:10,079
the consequences of that can only be

2770
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:13,118
good i mean you can

2771
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:14,719
you've got a clear plan right and and it

2772
01:37:13,118 --> 01:37:16,399
sounds like uh yeah i'm submitting

2773
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:18,480
proposals to nasa as we said that's

2774
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:20,479
right

2775
01:37:18,479 --> 01:37:21,919
i keep getting rejected i don't know why

2776
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:24,238
okay

2777
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:25,199
uh you need better diagrams better

2778
01:37:24,238 --> 01:37:26,799
better pictures

2779
01:37:25,198 --> 01:37:28,238
i should have thought of that you a

2780
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,000
while ago mentioned that

2781
01:37:28,238 --> 01:37:32,399
you know there's certain aspects in the

2782
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:34,560
history of the solar system and earth

2783
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:35,519
that resulted that it could have

2784
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:38,800
resulted in an

2785
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:42,639
opaque atmosphere but it didn't

2786
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:45,279
we couldn't see the stars um

2787
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:46,319
and uh somebody mentioned to me a little

2788
01:37:45,279 --> 01:37:47,599
bit ago

2789
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:51,359
it's almost like a philosophical

2790
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:55,440
question for you do you think

2791
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:58,799
humans like human society would develop

2792
01:37:55,439 --> 01:37:59,759
as it did or at all if we couldn't see

2793
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,800
the stars

2794
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:05,920
it would be drastically different

2795
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:08,159
just dr if it ever did develop so i

2796
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:11,600
think some of the early developments

2797
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:13,279
right of like fire and you know fire

2798
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:15,280
you know first of all that atmosphere

2799
01:38:13,279 --> 01:38:16,559
would be so hot because you know if you

2800
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:20,079
have an opaque

2801
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:23,360
atmosphere the temperature at the bottom

2802
01:38:20,079 --> 01:38:25,600
is is huge um so we would

2803
01:38:23,359 --> 01:38:27,359
be very different beings to start with

2804
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,280
we'd have it could be cloudy in certain

2805
01:38:27,359 --> 01:38:31,359
kinds of ways that you could still get

2806
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:33,679
okay think about like uh like a

2807
01:38:31,359 --> 01:38:36,559
greenhouse right a greenhouse

2808
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,679
is cloudy effectively uh but it's it's

2809
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:40,639
super hot

2810
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:41,840
um yeah it's hard to avoid having an

2811
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:44,239
atmosphere if you have an

2812
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:45,840
opaque atmosphere it's hard to right

2813
01:38:44,238 --> 01:38:48,559
venus is a great example

2814
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:49,760
right venus is i don't remember exactly

2815
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:52,800
how many degrees

2816
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:54,880
and but it's hundreds in celsius right

2817
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:56,719
it's not a hundred it's hundreds

2818
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,719
uh even though it's only a little bit

2819
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:00,319
closer to the sun that temperature

2820
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:02,319
is entirely coming from the fact that

2821
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:03,679
the atmosphere is thick so it's just a

2822
01:39:02,319 --> 01:39:06,319
sauna of sorts

2823
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:07,760
yeah yeah you go there you know you feel

2824
01:39:06,319 --> 01:39:10,880
refreshed after you come back

2825
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:12,800
you know but if you stay there i mean so

2826
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,560
okay take that as an assumption

2827
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:16,480
this is a philosophical question not a

2828
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,840
biological one so you have a life that

2829
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:19,759
develops under these

2830
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:21,279
extremely hot conditions yeah so let's

2831
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:24,560
see so much of

2832
01:39:21,279 --> 01:39:28,079
the early evolution of mankind

2833
01:39:24,560 --> 01:39:32,159
uh was driven by exploration yeah right

2834
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:35,359
and the kind of interest and stars

2835
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:38,479
originated in part as a tool

2836
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:42,158
to guide that exploration right i mean

2837
01:39:38,479 --> 01:39:44,399
that in itself i think would be a huge

2838
01:39:42,158 --> 01:39:45,920
uh you know a huge differential in the

2839
01:39:44,399 --> 01:39:48,158
way that we

2840
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:48,960
you know our our our evolution on this

2841
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:51,679
planet

2842
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:54,158
yes i mean stars is that's brilliant so

2843
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:55,520
even in that aspect but even in further

2844
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:59,359
aspects

2845
01:39:55,520 --> 01:40:01,440
uh astronomy just shows up in basically

2846
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:04,000
every single development in the history

2847
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:06,960
of science up until the 20th century

2848
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:08,479
it shows up so i wonder without that if

2849
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:10,719
we had we would have

2850
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:12,079
if we would even get like calculus yeah

2851
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:15,359
look that's a great

2852
01:40:12,079 --> 01:40:17,039
i mean that's a great point newton in

2853
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:19,039
part developed calculus

2854
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:20,079
because he was interested in

2855
01:40:19,039 --> 01:40:22,639
understanding

2856
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:23,439
explaining kepler's laws right in

2857
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:26,639
general

2858
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:27,599
that whole mechanistic understanding of

2859
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:29,359
the night sky

2860
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,800
right replacing a religious

2861
01:40:29,359 --> 01:40:33,599
understanding where you interpret

2862
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,320
you know this is you know this whatever

2863
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:37,679
fire god

2864
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:38,559
writing his you know uh little chariot

2865
01:40:37,679 --> 01:40:41,039
across the sky

2866
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:42,960
as opposed to you know this is some

2867
01:40:41,039 --> 01:40:46,719
mechanistic set of laws

2868
01:40:42,960 --> 01:40:47,198
that transformed humanity and arguably

2869
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:49,920
put us

2870
01:40:47,198 --> 01:40:50,399
on the on the course that we're on today

2871
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:53,279
right

2872
01:40:50,399 --> 01:40:54,399
the entirety of the last 400 years and

2873
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:57,439
the development of

2874
01:40:54,399 --> 01:40:59,039
kind of our technological world that we

2875
01:40:57,439 --> 01:41:02,879
live in today

2876
01:40:59,039 --> 01:41:05,840
was sparked by by that right

2877
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:06,960
abandoning an effectively you know a

2878
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:09,039
non-secular

2879
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,840
view of the natural world and and kind

2880
01:41:09,039 --> 01:41:14,238
of thing okay

2881
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:16,079
this can be understood and if it can be

2882
01:41:14,238 --> 01:41:17,279
understood it can be utilized we can

2883
01:41:16,079 --> 01:41:20,079
create our own

2884
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:22,238
uh variants of this absolutely we would

2885
01:41:20,079 --> 01:41:26,399
be a very very different species

2886
01:41:22,238 --> 01:41:29,039
without astronomy this i think extends

2887
01:41:26,399 --> 01:41:30,399
beyond just astronomy right there there

2888
01:41:29,039 --> 01:41:33,920
are questions

2889
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:37,039
like why do we need to spend money on

2890
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:40,560
x right where x can be anything like

2891
01:41:37,039 --> 01:41:44,079
paleontology like right uh the mating

2892
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:47,280
patterns of uh penguins yeah that's like

2893
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:50,079
essential that's right um i think

2894
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:52,238
you know there's a tremendous uh

2895
01:41:50,079 --> 01:41:56,158
underappreciation for the usefulness

2896
01:41:52,238 --> 01:41:58,158
of useless knowledge right i mean

2897
01:41:56,158 --> 01:42:00,319
uh that's brilliant i didn't come up

2898
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:02,960
with this this was this is a little book

2899
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:04,319
by the guy who started the institute for

2900
01:42:02,960 --> 01:42:07,439
advanced studies

2901
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:10,238
but um you know it's

2902
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:11,519
it's so true so much of the electronics

2903
01:42:10,238 --> 01:42:13,439
that are on this table

2904
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:15,119
right work on maxwell's equations

2905
01:42:13,439 --> 01:42:17,118
maxwell weren't

2906
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:19,359
wasn't sitting around in the 1800s

2907
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:22,319
saying you know i hope one day

2908
01:42:19,359 --> 01:42:23,198
you know uh we'll make you know a couple

2909
01:42:22,319 --> 01:42:26,880
mics so

2910
01:42:23,198 --> 01:42:28,559
you know a couple uh you know a couple

2911
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:31,039
guys can

2912
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:32,480
have this conversation right that that

2913
01:42:31,039 --> 01:42:34,960
wasn't at no

2914
01:42:32,479 --> 01:42:35,839
at no point was that the motivation and

2915
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:38,960
yet

2916
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:40,960
you know it gave us the world that we

2917
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:44,079
have today and the answer is if you

2918
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:45,760
a purely pragmatic person if you don't

2919
01:42:44,079 --> 01:42:47,279
care at all about kind of the human

2920
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,880
condition none of this

2921
01:42:47,279 --> 01:42:54,800
the answer is uh you can tax it

2922
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:58,960
right like the useless things

2923
01:42:54,800 --> 01:43:01,600
have been have created way more capital

2924
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,000
than useful things and the sad thing i

2925
01:43:01,600 --> 01:43:03,840
mean

2926
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:05,520
first of all it's really important to

2927
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,719
think about and it's

2928
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,520
brilliant in the in the following

2929
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:11,198
context

2930
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,639
like neil degrasse tyson has this book

2931
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:15,198
about the role

2932
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:17,279
of military-based funding in the

2933
01:43:15,198 --> 01:43:20,879
development of science

2934
01:43:17,279 --> 01:43:23,039
and then so much of technological

2935
01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:26,480
breakthroughs in the 20th century

2936
01:43:23,039 --> 01:43:28,238
had to do with humans working on

2937
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:30,079
different military things

2938
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:32,000
and then the outcome of that had nothing

2939
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:33,679
to do with military it had some military

2940
01:43:32,000 --> 01:43:35,760
application but

2941
01:43:33,679 --> 01:43:38,158
their impact was much much bigger than

2942
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:41,199
the military the splitting of the atom

2943
01:43:38,158 --> 01:43:43,198
is is a kind of a canonical example of

2944
01:43:41,198 --> 01:43:45,279
this we all know the tragedy that

2945
01:43:43,198 --> 01:43:47,678
you know arises from splitting of the

2946
01:43:45,279 --> 01:43:51,439
atom and and yet you know

2947
01:43:47,679 --> 01:43:53,359
so much i mean the atom itself

2948
01:43:51,439 --> 01:43:54,479
does not care for what purpose it is

2949
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:57,279
being split

2950
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:58,879
so so i wonder if if we you take took

2951
01:43:57,279 --> 01:43:59,759
the same amount of funding as we used

2952
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,800
for war

2953
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:03,520
and poured it into like totally

2954
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,440
seemingly

2955
01:44:03,520 --> 01:44:06,560
useless things like the mating patterns

2956
01:44:05,439 --> 01:44:08,960
of penguins

2957
01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:10,320
we would get the internet anyway i i

2958
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:12,800
think so i think so

2959
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:13,519
and uh you know perhaps more of the

2960
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:16,480
internet

2961
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:17,520
would have uh would have penguins you

2962
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:19,678
know

2963
01:44:17,520 --> 01:44:20,560
so we're both joking but in some sense

2964
01:44:19,679 --> 01:44:22,800
like

2965
01:44:20,560 --> 01:44:24,080
i wonder it's not the the penguins

2966
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:27,360
because penguins is more about

2967
01:44:24,079 --> 01:44:29,279
sort of biology but all useless kind of

2968
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:32,639
tinkering and all kinds of

2969
01:44:29,279 --> 01:44:35,039
uh in all kinds of avenues

2970
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:36,800
and also because military applications

2971
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:40,000
are often

2972
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:43,679
um burdened by the secrecy required

2973
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:46,158
so it's often like so much uh

2974
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:47,440
the openness is lacking and if we

2975
01:44:46,158 --> 01:44:48,559
learned anything from the last few

2976
01:44:47,439 --> 01:44:51,678
decades is that

2977
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:53,600
when there's openness and science that

2978
01:44:51,679 --> 01:44:55,199
accelerates the development of science

2979
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:58,639
that's right that's true

2980
01:44:55,198 --> 01:45:01,359
the openness of science truly

2981
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:02,079
you know it benefits everybody the

2982
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:04,719
notion that

2983
01:45:02,079 --> 01:45:06,880
if you know i share my science with you

2984
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:09,359
then you're gonna catch up and like

2985
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:11,359
know the same thing that is a

2986
01:45:09,359 --> 01:45:12,079
short-sighted viewpoint because if you

2987
01:45:11,359 --> 01:45:15,439
catch up

2988
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:17,840
and you open you know

2989
01:45:15,439 --> 01:45:19,279
you you discover something that puts me

2990
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:22,239
in a position to do

2991
01:45:19,279 --> 01:45:23,519
the next step right it's just so i

2992
01:45:22,238 --> 01:45:27,039
absolutely agree

2993
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:29,760
with um with all this i mean uh

2994
01:45:27,039 --> 01:45:31,920
the kind of question of like military

2995
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:34,880
funding versus non-military funding is

2996
01:45:31,920 --> 01:45:37,039
is obviously a complicated one but at

2997
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:37,440
the end of the day i think we have to

2998
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:41,118
get

2999
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:44,399
over the notion as a society

3000
01:45:41,118 --> 01:45:45,198
that we are going to you know pay for

3001
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:48,000
this

3002
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:48,399
and then we will get that right that's

3003
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:51,439
true

3004
01:45:48,399 --> 01:45:53,279
if you're buying like i don't know

3005
01:45:51,439 --> 01:45:55,039
toilet paper or something right it's

3006
01:45:53,279 --> 01:45:57,439
just not true in the intellectual

3007
01:45:55,039 --> 01:46:00,479
pursuit that's not how it works

3008
01:45:57,439 --> 01:46:01,678
and sometimes it'll fail right like

3009
01:46:00,479 --> 01:46:04,559
sometimes like

3010
01:46:01,679 --> 01:46:05,440
a huge fraction of what i do right i

3011
01:46:04,560 --> 01:46:06,960
come up with an idea

3012
01:46:05,439 --> 01:46:08,960
i think oh it's great and then i work it

3013
01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,239
out it's totally not great right it

3014
01:46:08,960 --> 01:46:13,198
fails immediately

3015
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:13,839
failure is not a sign that the initial

3016
01:46:13,198 --> 01:46:16,000
pursuit

3017
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:17,679
was worthless right failure is just part

3018
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,560
of this kind of this whole exploration

3019
01:46:17,679 --> 01:46:20,079
thing and

3020
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:21,760
we should fund more and more of this

3021
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:22,639
exploration the variety of the

3022
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:25,199
exploration

3023
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:26,960
i think it was linus pauling or somebody

3024
01:46:25,198 --> 01:46:28,000
from you know that generation of

3025
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:31,600
scientists and

3026
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:34,639
you know a good way to have good ideas

3027
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:38,079
is to have a lot of ideas right so

3028
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:39,840
that's i think that's true um if you are

3029
01:46:38,079 --> 01:46:42,158
conservative in your thinking if you

3030
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:44,639
worry about proposing something that's

3031
01:46:42,158 --> 01:46:48,079
going to fail and oh what if you know

3032
01:46:44,639 --> 01:46:49,679
like i there's no science police that's

3033
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:52,800
going to come and arrest you for

3034
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:55,359
proposing the wrong thing and you know

3035
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:57,360
it's also just like why would you why

3036
01:46:55,359 --> 01:47:01,039
would you do science if you're

3037
01:46:57,359 --> 01:47:02,399
afraid of you know taking that step it'd

3038
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:05,039
be so much better

3039
01:47:02,399 --> 01:47:06,719
to propose things that are that are

3040
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:08,319
plausible that are interesting

3041
01:47:06,719 --> 01:47:10,158
and then for a fraction of them to be

3042
01:47:08,319 --> 01:47:11,840
wrong than to just kind of

3043
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:13,198
you know make incremental progress all

3044
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:16,319
your life right

3045
01:47:13,198 --> 01:47:16,799
speaking of wild ideas let me ask you

3046
01:47:16,319 --> 01:47:18,559
about

3047
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:22,639
the thing we mentioned previously which

3048
01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:25,119
is this interstellar object a muamoa

3049
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:27,279
could it be space junk from a distant

3050
01:47:25,118 --> 01:47:30,319
alien civilization

3051
01:47:27,279 --> 01:47:33,439
you can't immediately discount that

3052
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:35,439
by saying absolutely it cannot

3053
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:37,118
anything can be a space junk i mean from

3054
01:47:35,439 --> 01:47:38,799
that point of view can any of the kuiper

3055
01:47:37,118 --> 01:47:41,279
belt objects we see

3056
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:42,560
okay you know be space beijing anything

3057
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:44,880
on the night sky

3058
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,639
can in principle be space junk and

3059
01:47:44,880 --> 01:47:48,960
kuiper belt would catch interstellar

3060
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:50,480
objects potentially and like

3061
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:52,960
force them into an orbit if they're like

3062
01:47:50,479 --> 01:47:54,879
small enough uh not the kuiper belt

3063
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,840
itself but you can imagine like jupiter

3064
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:58,639
family comets

3065
01:47:55,840 --> 01:48:00,560
being captured uh you know so so you can

3066
01:47:58,639 --> 01:48:03,118
actually capture things

3067
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,080
it's even easier to do this very early

3068
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:05,920
in the solar system

3069
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:08,158
like early in the solar system's life

3070
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:11,359
while it's still in a cluster of stars

3071
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:14,399
um it's unavoidable that you

3072
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:15,039
capture debris whether it be natural

3073
01:48:14,399 --> 01:48:17,198
debris or

3074
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:18,079
unnatural debris or just debris of some

3075
01:48:17,198 --> 01:48:21,519
kind from

3076
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:22,000
other stars that it's like a daycare

3077
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:23,920
center

3078
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:26,000
right like everybody passes their

3079
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:28,079
infections on to other kids yeah

3080
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,920
um you know or more and more there's

3081
01:48:28,079 --> 01:48:31,920
been a lot of discussion

3082
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,920
about and there's been a lot of interest

3083
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:35,600
in this over like is it is it

3084
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:37,760
aliens or is it not but let's like if

3085
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:39,679
you just kind of look at the facts

3086
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,760
like what we know about it is it's kind

3087
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:44,960
of like a weird shape

3088
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:47,280
and it also accelerated yeah right like

3089
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:48,480
that's the two those are those are the

3090
01:48:47,279 --> 01:48:52,399
two interesting

3091
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:56,559
uh things about it there are

3092
01:48:52,399 --> 01:49:00,319
um there are puzzles about it and

3093
01:48:56,560 --> 01:49:03,600
perhaps the most uh daring resolution

3094
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:06,158
to this puzzle is that it's not you know

3095
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:08,639
aliens or it's not like a rock it's

3096
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:11,759
actually a piece of hydrogen ice

3097
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:13,760
so this is a friend of mine you know

3098
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,119
daryl seligman greg laughlin came up

3099
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:18,320
with this uh

3100
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:20,799
idea where that in

3101
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:22,960
giant molecular clouds that are just

3102
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:26,239
clouds of hydrogen helium gas that

3103
01:49:22,960 --> 01:49:29,679
live in live throughout the galaxy

3104
01:49:26,238 --> 01:49:32,479
at their cores you can condense ice

3105
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:34,719
to become these hydrogen you know

3106
01:49:32,479 --> 01:49:38,479
icebergs if you will and then

3107
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:41,439
uh that explains many of the aspects of

3108
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:42,959
uh in fact i think that explains all of

3109
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:46,000
the

3110
01:49:42,960 --> 01:49:48,319
mystery how it becomes elongated because

3111
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:50,399
basically the hydrogen ice sublimates

3112
01:49:48,319 --> 01:49:53,198
and kind of like a bar of soap

3113
01:49:50,399 --> 01:49:53,920
that you know slowly kind of elongates

3114
01:49:53,198 --> 01:49:57,359
as you

3115
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:58,399
uh as you strip away the the surface

3116
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:01,039
layers

3117
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:02,960
uh how it was able to accelerate because

3118
01:50:01,039 --> 01:50:04,560
of a jet that is produced from

3119
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:05,760
you know the hydrogen coming off of it

3120
01:50:04,560 --> 01:50:07,920
but you can't see it because it's

3121
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:12,239
hydrogen gas like all of this stuff

3122
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:14,880
uh kind of falls together nicely

3123
01:50:12,238 --> 01:50:15,598
i'm i'm intrigued by that idea truly

3124
01:50:14,880 --> 01:50:18,239
because

3125
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:20,159
it's like if that's true that's a new

3126
01:50:18,238 --> 01:50:23,759
type of astrophysical

3127
01:50:20,158 --> 01:50:25,198
object and it would be produced by

3128
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:27,119
what's the monster that produced

3129
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:28,960
initially that kind of object

3130
01:50:27,118 --> 01:50:30,319
so this is giant molecular molecular

3131
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:33,520
clouds they're everywhere

3132
01:50:30,319 --> 01:50:36,238
i mean they are the fact that they exist

3133
01:50:33,520 --> 01:50:36,880
is not are they rogue clouds or are they

3134
01:50:36,238 --> 01:50:39,039
part of like an

3135
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:40,639
oort cloud no no they're not so clouds

3136
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:42,399
yeah they're just floating about

3137
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:44,560
yeah so if you go like a lot of people

3138
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:48,399
imagine the galaxy

3139
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:50,639
as being a you know a bunch of stars

3140
01:50:48,399 --> 01:50:52,158
right and they're just orbiting right

3141
01:50:50,639 --> 01:50:55,520
but the truth is if you fly between

3142
01:50:52,158 --> 01:50:56,399
stars you run into clouds uh they don't

3143
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:58,560
have any large

3144
01:50:56,399 --> 01:50:59,920
object that creates orbits they're just

3145
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:01,760
floating about just floating

3146
01:50:59,920 --> 01:51:03,359
but why are they floating together oh

3147
01:51:01,760 --> 01:51:03,920
they just flowed together for time and

3148
01:51:03,359 --> 01:51:06,559
not

3149
01:51:03,920 --> 01:51:08,719
well so these are the these eventually

3150
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:11,760
become the nurseries of stars

3151
01:51:08,719 --> 01:51:14,560
so as they as they cool they contract

3152
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,119
and uh you know then collapse into stars

3153
01:51:14,560 --> 01:51:17,760
or into

3154
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:20,238
groups of stars but some of them they

3155
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:23,199
the starless

3156
01:51:20,238 --> 01:51:25,198
molecular clouds according to the

3157
01:51:23,198 --> 01:51:28,960
calculations that daryl and greg

3158
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:31,519
did can uh can create these like

3159
01:51:28,960 --> 01:51:34,000
icicles of hydrogen ice i wonder why

3160
01:51:31,520 --> 01:51:34,880
they would be flying so fast because

3161
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:37,840
they seem to be

3162
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:37,840
moving pretty fast

3163
01:51:38,158 --> 01:51:41,359
that's just because of the acceleration

3164
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:44,560
due to uh due to the sun

3165
01:51:41,359 --> 01:51:46,960
if you stop i mean it's like

3166
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:48,000
take something really far away let it go

3167
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:50,239
and the sun is here

3168
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,800
by the time it comes close to the sun

3169
01:51:50,238 --> 01:51:55,519
right it's moving pretty fast

3170
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:56,079
so that's an attractive explanation i

3171
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:58,800
think

3172
01:51:56,079 --> 01:52:00,559
not so much because uh it's cool but it

3173
01:51:58,800 --> 01:52:03,599
makes a clear prediction

3174
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:06,800
right of when their rubin

3175
01:52:03,599 --> 01:52:09,520
observatory comes online next year or so

3176
01:52:06,800 --> 01:52:10,320
we will discover many many more of these

3177
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:14,000
objects

3178
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:17,198
right and they have um so i like i like

3179
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:19,359
theories that are falsifiable right not

3180
01:52:17,198 --> 01:52:21,279
not just testable but falsifiable it's

3181
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:23,359
good to have a falsifiable theory where

3182
01:52:21,279 --> 01:52:26,559
you can say that's not true

3183
01:52:23,359 --> 01:52:29,039
uh aliens is one that's

3184
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,239
fundamentally difficult to say no that's

3185
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:32,479
not aliens

3186
01:52:30,238 --> 01:52:35,359
the interesting thing to me if you look

3187
01:52:32,479 --> 01:52:36,718
at one alien civilization

3188
01:52:35,359 --> 01:52:38,880
and then we look at the things it

3189
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:39,760
produces in terms of if we were to try

3190
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:43,199
to detect

3191
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:46,560
the alien civilization the

3192
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:51,039
there's like uh say there's 10 billion

3193
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:51,039
aliens there would probably be

3194
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:59,440
trillions of dumb drone type things

3195
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:00,560
produced by the aliens and then be many

3196
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:04,399
many many

3197
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:06,159
more orders of magnitude of junk

3198
01:53:04,399 --> 01:53:07,759
so like if you were to look for an alien

3199
01:53:06,158 --> 01:53:09,839
civilization in my mind

3200
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:12,159
you would be looking for the junk that's

3201
01:53:09,840 --> 01:53:15,039
the more efficient thing to look for

3202
01:53:12,158 --> 01:53:16,960
so i'm not saying has any

3203
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:19,679
characteristics of space junk but

3204
01:53:16,960 --> 01:53:20,560
it kind of opened my eyes like to the

3205
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:22,880
idea that

3206
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:23,840
we shouldn't necessarily be looking to

3207
01:53:22,880 --> 01:53:26,239
the queen

3208
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:27,599
of the ant colony we should be looking

3209
01:53:26,238 --> 01:53:30,638
at i don't know

3210
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:31,360
i don't know like the traces of alien

3211
01:53:30,639 --> 01:53:33,520
life that

3212
01:53:31,359 --> 01:53:34,399
doesn't look intelligent in any way may

3213
01:53:33,520 --> 01:53:36,480
not even look like

3214
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:37,839
life it could be just garbage we should

3215
01:53:36,479 --> 01:53:41,359
be looking for

3216
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:44,159
garbage just generically

3217
01:53:41,359 --> 01:53:45,359
garbage that's producible by uh

3218
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:48,000
unnatural

3219
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:49,598
uh forces i mean for me at least that

3220
01:53:48,000 --> 01:53:51,198
was kind of interesting because

3221
01:53:49,599 --> 01:53:52,880
if you have a successful alien

3222
01:53:51,198 --> 01:53:54,559
civilization

3223
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:56,480
that we will be producing many more

3224
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:56,800
orders and magnitude of junk and that'll

3225
01:53:56,479 --> 01:53:59,198
be

3226
01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,639
easier potentially to detect well so you

3227
01:53:59,198 --> 01:54:01,439
have to produce the junk but you have to

3228
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:04,159
also lunch

3229
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:04,559
launch it so this is the this is where i

3230
01:54:04,158 --> 01:54:07,679
mean

3231
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:10,480
let's let's imagine disposal yeah but

3232
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:11,599
let's imagine we are a successful

3233
01:54:10,479 --> 01:54:13,439
civilization that

3234
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:15,119
you know has made it to space we clearly

3235
01:54:13,439 --> 01:54:17,598
have right um

3236
01:54:15,118 --> 01:54:18,799
and yes we're in the infancy of that

3237
01:54:17,599 --> 01:54:20,719
pursuit but

3238
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:22,000
you know we've launched i don't know how

3239
01:54:20,719 --> 01:54:25,118
many satellites

3240
01:54:22,000 --> 01:54:28,079
um probably if you count

3241
01:54:25,118 --> 01:54:28,799
gps satellites it must be at least

3242
01:54:28,079 --> 01:54:30,158
thousands

3243
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:31,599
it's it's certainly thousands i don't

3244
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:32,319
know if it's over ten thousand yeah but

3245
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:33,920
it's done that

3246
01:54:32,319 --> 01:54:36,000
but it's on that like a large order of

3247
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:38,639
magnitude how many of the things

3248
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:41,039
that we've launched will ever leave the

3249
01:54:38,639 --> 01:54:43,760
solar system i think two

3250
01:54:41,039 --> 01:54:45,279
two well maybe the voyager the voyager

3251
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:46,719
one voyager two i don't know if the

3252
01:54:45,279 --> 01:54:49,039
pioneer

3253
01:54:46,719 --> 01:54:51,039
so maybe three like oh there's also a

3254
01:54:49,039 --> 01:54:53,359
tesla roadster out there

3255
01:54:51,039 --> 01:54:54,560
uh that that one it will never leave the

3256
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:56,639
solar system it'll just

3257
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:58,080
i think that one will eventually collide

3258
01:54:56,639 --> 01:55:01,359
with mars that can be

3259
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:05,279
spacex's first mars destination

3260
01:55:01,359 --> 01:55:08,000
um but look so there's an energetic cost

3261
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:09,519
to interstellar travel uh which is

3262
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,840
really hard to overcome

3263
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,719
and when when we think about you know

3264
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:14,239
generically

3265
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:16,480
what do we look for in an alien

3266
01:55:14,238 --> 01:55:17,439
civilization oftentimes we tend to

3267
01:55:16,479 --> 01:55:19,359
imagine that the

3268
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:21,118
thing you look for is the thing that

3269
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:24,238
we're doing right now

3270
01:55:21,118 --> 01:55:26,960
yeah right so i think that um you know

3271
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:28,319
if i if i look at the future right i

3272
01:55:26,960 --> 01:55:30,319
mean for a while like

3273
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:32,399
okay if aliens are are out there they

3274
01:55:30,319 --> 01:55:35,519
must be broadcasting and radio

3275
01:55:32,399 --> 01:55:37,519
right that radio um

3276
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:38,960
you know the amount that we broadcast in

3277
01:55:37,520 --> 01:55:41,920
radio has

3278
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:42,800
diminished tremendously in the last 50

3279
01:55:41,920 --> 01:55:46,319
years

3280
01:55:42,800 --> 01:55:49,199
but we're doing a lot more computation

3281
01:55:46,319 --> 01:55:50,079
right what are the signs of computation

3282
01:55:49,198 --> 01:55:51,759
like that's a good

3283
01:55:50,079 --> 01:55:53,279
that's an interesting question to ask

3284
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:55,360
right

3285
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:56,719
where i don't know i think something on

3286
01:55:55,359 --> 01:56:00,238
the order of a few percent

3287
01:55:56,719 --> 01:56:00,639
of the entire electrical grid last year

3288
01:56:00,238 --> 01:56:04,879
went

3289
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:07,279
to mining bitcoin right uh you know well

3290
01:56:04,880 --> 01:56:09,039
yeah the there could be a lot of in the

3291
01:56:07,279 --> 01:56:10,479
future different consequences of the

3292
01:56:09,039 --> 01:56:12,719
computation which

3293
01:56:10,479 --> 01:56:14,079
i mean by unbiased but it could be

3294
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:18,800
robotics it could be artificial

3295
01:56:14,079 --> 01:56:21,198
intelligence so we may be looking for

3296
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:23,119
intelligent looking objects like that's

3297
01:56:21,198 --> 01:56:23,519
what i meant by probes like things that

3298
01:56:23,118 --> 01:56:25,920
move

3299
01:56:23,520 --> 01:56:28,239
in kind of artificial ways but the

3300
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:31,760
emergence of ai is not an if

3301
01:56:28,238 --> 01:56:33,919
right it's it's happening

3302
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:35,920
right in front of our eyes and the

3303
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:38,158
energetic costs associated

3304
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:39,679
with that are becoming you know a

3305
01:56:38,158 --> 01:56:42,079
tangible problem

3306
01:56:39,679 --> 01:56:44,960
so i think you know if you imagine kind

3307
01:56:42,079 --> 01:56:48,238
of extrapolating that into the future

3308
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:50,639
right what are the you know

3309
01:56:48,238 --> 01:56:53,198
what becomes the bottleneck right the

3310
01:56:50,639 --> 01:56:56,159
bottleneck might be

3311
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:56,960
powering you know powering the broadly

3312
01:56:56,158 --> 01:56:59,439
speaking not

3313
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,719
one air but powering that entire ai

3314
01:56:59,439 --> 01:57:03,759
ecosystem

3315
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:07,118
right so i don't know i think

3316
01:57:03,760 --> 01:57:09,280
you know space junk isn't is kind of

3317
01:57:07,118 --> 01:57:11,279
uh it's an interesting idea but it's

3318
01:57:09,279 --> 01:57:12,559
heavily influenced by like sci-fi of

3319
01:57:11,279 --> 01:57:15,519
1950s where

3320
01:57:12,560 --> 01:57:16,400
by 2020 we're all like flying to the

3321
01:57:15,520 --> 01:57:19,119
moon

3322
01:57:16,399 --> 01:57:21,039
um and so we produce a lot of space junk

3323
01:57:19,118 --> 01:57:23,920
i'm not

3324
01:57:21,039 --> 01:57:25,840
sure if that's the pathway that alien

3325
01:57:23,920 --> 01:57:27,279
civilizations take

3326
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:28,880
i've also never seen an alien

3327
01:57:27,279 --> 01:57:33,599
civilization that's that's

3328
01:57:28,880 --> 01:57:35,440
true but if your theory of chill

3329
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:36,960
turns out to be true and then we don't

3330
01:57:35,439 --> 01:57:39,118
you know we don't necessarily

3331
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:40,158
explore we seize the exploration phase

3332
01:57:39,118 --> 01:57:42,079
of uh

3333
01:57:40,158 --> 01:57:45,039
like alien civilizations quickly sees

3334
01:57:42,079 --> 01:57:48,559
the exploration phase of their

3335
01:57:45,039 --> 01:57:50,399
um of their efforts then uh

3336
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:52,400
then perhaps they'll just be chilling in

3337
01:57:50,399 --> 01:57:55,279
a particular space

3338
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:56,879
expanding slowly but then using up a lot

3339
01:57:55,279 --> 01:57:58,800
of resources and then have to have a lot

3340
01:57:56,880 --> 01:58:01,679
of garbage disposal that

3341
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:03,360
sends stuff out and the other you know

3342
01:58:01,679 --> 01:58:04,719
the other idea was that it could be a

3343
01:58:03,359 --> 01:58:08,000
relay

3344
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:09,279
that uh you almost have like these gps

3345
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:11,439
like markers these

3346
01:58:09,279 --> 01:58:13,359
sent throughout which i think is kind of

3347
01:58:11,439 --> 01:58:14,799
interesting it's uh similar to this

3348
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:19,279
probe idea

3349
01:58:14,800 --> 01:58:23,279
of sending a large number of probes out

3350
01:58:19,279 --> 01:58:26,079
to measure gravitational um

3351
01:58:23,279 --> 01:58:27,359
to to to measure basically yeah the the

3352
01:58:26,079 --> 01:58:29,118
gravitational field

3353
01:58:27,359 --> 01:58:31,439
essentially i mean a lot of people at

3354
01:58:29,118 --> 01:58:32,960
cal tech and mit are

3355
01:58:31,439 --> 01:58:35,519
trying to measure gravitational fields

3356
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:36,480
and there's there's a lot of ideas of

3357
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:40,000
sending

3358
01:58:36,479 --> 01:58:41,759
uh stuff out there that

3359
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,439
accurately measures those gravitational

3360
01:58:41,760 --> 01:58:45,760
fields uh to

3361
01:58:43,439 --> 01:58:46,799
have a greater understanding of the

3362
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:48,880
early universe

3363
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:50,960
but then you might realize that

3364
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,639
communication through gravitation

3365
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:54,480
through gravity is actually much more

3366
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:55,199
effective than than radio waves for

3367
01:58:54,479 --> 01:58:56,799
example

3368
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:58,319
something like that and then you send

3369
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:59,920
out

3370
01:58:58,319 --> 01:59:02,559
i mean okay if you're an alien

3371
01:58:59,920 --> 01:59:06,480
civilization that's able to

3372
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:08,159
have gigantic masses like basically

3373
01:59:06,479 --> 01:59:10,718
we're getting there as a as a

3374
01:59:08,158 --> 01:59:14,319
civilization no we're not not even close

3375
01:59:10,719 --> 01:59:16,960
well i mean yeah okay

3376
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:18,399
i i mean like be able to sort of uh play

3377
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:20,719
with black holes that kind of thing so

3378
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:23,359
we're talking about a whole nother diff

3379
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:25,439
order of magnitude and masses then it

3380
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:26,960
may be very effective to send signals

3381
01:59:25,439 --> 01:59:29,118
via gravitational waves

3382
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:30,239
i actually my sense is that all of these

3383
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:33,679
things are

3384
01:59:30,238 --> 01:59:35,678
genuinely difficult to predict you know

3385
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:37,920
and i don't mean like to to kind of shy

3386
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:41,679
away i just i really mean if you think

3387
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:42,560
if you take um imagination of what the

3388
01:59:41,679 --> 01:59:46,319
future

3389
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:48,880
looked like from you know 500 years ago

3390
01:59:46,319 --> 01:59:49,599
right it's just it is so hard to

3391
01:59:48,880 --> 01:59:52,529
conceive

3392
01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:53,679
of the impossible right so um

3393
01:59:52,529 --> 01:59:56,238
[Music]

3394
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:58,480
it's it's almost like um you know it's

3395
01:59:56,238 --> 02:00:01,279
almost limiting to try and imagine

3396
01:59:58,479 --> 02:00:02,718
things that are an order of magnitude uh

3397
02:00:01,279 --> 02:00:04,719
you know or two orders of magnitude

3398
02:00:02,719 --> 02:00:07,359
ahead in terms of progress

3399
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:08,000
just because you know you mentioned cars

3400
02:00:07,359 --> 02:00:10,719
before

3401
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:11,520
you know if you were to ask people what

3402
02:00:10,719 --> 02:00:14,880
they wanted

3403
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:18,080
in 1870 is faster buggies

3404
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:19,199
right so um so i think the whole like

3405
02:00:18,079 --> 02:00:22,880
kind of

3406
02:00:19,198 --> 02:00:26,158
you know alien conversation inevitably

3407
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:29,599
gets gets limited by by our entire

3408
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:31,598
kind of collective um astrophysical lack

3409
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:35,119
of imagination

3410
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:38,000
so to push back a little bit i find that

3411
02:00:35,118 --> 02:00:39,598
it's really interesting to talk about

3412
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:41,760
these wild ideas about the future

3413
02:00:39,599 --> 02:00:44,960
whether it's aliens whether it's ai

3414
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:47,199
with brilliant people like yourself

3415
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:48,639
who are focused on very particular tools

3416
02:00:47,198 --> 02:00:50,638
of science we have today

3417
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:52,079
to solve very particular like rigorous

3418
02:00:50,639 --> 02:00:54,079
scientific questions

3419
02:00:52,079 --> 02:00:55,599
and it's almost like putting on this

3420
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:57,439
wild dreamy hat like

3421
02:00:55,599 --> 02:00:59,279
some percent of the time and say like

3422
02:00:57,439 --> 02:01:01,678
what are like what would alien

3423
02:00:59,279 --> 02:01:04,880
civilizations look like what would alien

3424
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:06,800
trash look like well what would our own

3425
02:01:04,880 --> 02:01:09,679
civilization that sends out

3426
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:10,719
trillions of ai systems out there like

3427
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:12,560
hal 9000

3428
02:01:10,719 --> 02:01:14,239
but 10 000 out there what would that

3429
02:01:12,560 --> 02:01:16,239
look like and you're right

3430
02:01:14,238 --> 02:01:18,000
any one prediction is probably going to

3431
02:01:16,238 --> 02:01:19,678
be horrendously wrong

3432
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:21,679
but there's something about creating

3433
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:24,880
these kind of wild predictions

3434
02:01:21,679 --> 02:01:26,158
that kind of opens up there's a huge

3435
02:01:24,880 --> 02:01:29,359
magnetism to it

3436
02:01:26,158 --> 02:01:33,279
right and some of some of it um

3437
02:01:29,359 --> 02:01:36,238
you know i mean some of the jules verne

3438
02:01:33,279 --> 02:01:36,960
novels did a phenomenal job predicting

3439
02:01:36,238 --> 02:01:39,678
the future

3440
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:40,960
right uh that that actually was a great

3441
02:01:39,679 --> 02:01:43,199
example of what you're talking about

3442
02:01:40,960 --> 02:01:46,719
like allowing your imagination to

3443
02:01:43,198 --> 02:01:49,519
run free i mean i just hope

3444
02:01:46,719 --> 02:01:50,319
i just hope there there's dragons that's

3445
02:01:49,520 --> 02:01:54,560
like

3446
02:01:50,319 --> 02:01:54,559
i love dragons yeah dragons are the best

3447
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:58,560
but see the cool thing about science

3448
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:00,639
fiction and these kinds of conversations

3449
02:01:58,560 --> 02:02:02,800
it doesn't just predict the future i

3450
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:06,159
think some of these things

3451
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:07,199
will create the future pla planting the

3452
02:02:06,158 --> 02:02:09,359
idea

3453
02:02:07,198 --> 02:02:12,319
this will help the humans are amazing

3454
02:02:09,359 --> 02:02:15,598
like fake it till you make it

3455
02:02:12,319 --> 02:02:18,000
humans are really good at uh taking an

3456
02:02:15,599 --> 02:02:20,880
idea that seems impossible at the time

3457
02:02:18,000 --> 02:02:21,920
and for one any one individual human

3458
02:02:20,880 --> 02:02:24,560
that idea

3459
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:26,239
is like a it's like planting a seed yes

3460
02:02:24,560 --> 02:02:28,800
that eventually materializes itself

3461
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:29,759
it's weird it's weird science fiction

3462
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,599
can

3463
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:33,360
create science drive some of it it

3464
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:37,360
drives the science i agree with you

3465
02:02:33,359 --> 02:02:40,479
and uh and i think in this regard

3466
02:02:37,359 --> 02:02:41,679
you know i i'm like a sucker for for

3467
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:45,439
sci-fi

3468
02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:46,719
um it's it's all i listen to like now

3469
02:02:45,439 --> 02:02:49,118
when i when i run

3470
02:02:46,719 --> 02:02:49,920
and um and some of it is completely

3471
02:02:49,118 --> 02:02:52,079
implausible

3472
02:02:49,920 --> 02:02:53,279
right and it's like i don't care it's

3473
02:02:52,079 --> 02:02:57,198
it's so

3474
02:02:53,279 --> 02:03:00,319
it's uh it's both entertaining

3475
02:02:57,198 --> 02:03:01,198
and uh you know it's just like it's

3476
02:03:00,319 --> 02:03:03,679
imagination

3477
02:03:01,198 --> 02:03:05,359
you know about the black clouds book i

3478
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:07,359
think this by fred hoyle

3479
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:09,118
this is like this has great connections

3480
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:11,118
with sort of a lot of the advancements

3481
02:03:09,118 --> 02:03:14,158
that are happening in nlp

3482
02:03:11,118 --> 02:03:15,839
um right now right with

3483
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:17,598
you know transformer models and so on

3484
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:18,239
but uh you know it's this black cloud

3485
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:21,039
shows up

3486
02:03:18,238 --> 02:03:22,158
in in the solar system and then you know

3487
02:03:21,039 --> 02:03:24,560
people try to

3488
02:03:22,158 --> 02:03:25,439
send radio and then it learns to talk

3489
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:27,679
back at you

3490
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:29,279
wow you know so anyway we don't have to

3491
02:03:27,679 --> 02:03:31,118
talk at all about it but it's just

3492
02:03:29,279 --> 02:03:33,279
it's something worth checking out with

3493
02:03:31,118 --> 02:03:34,639
that on the alien front with the black

3494
02:03:33,279 --> 02:03:37,118
claw to me and

3495
02:03:34,639 --> 02:03:38,639
exactly and the llp front and also just

3496
02:03:37,118 --> 02:03:41,118
explainability of ai

3497
02:03:38,639 --> 02:03:42,800
it's fascinating just a very question

3498
02:03:41,118 --> 02:03:44,000
stephen wolfram looked at this with the

3499
02:03:42,800 --> 02:03:45,440
movie arrival

3500
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,520
it's like what would be the common

3501
02:03:45,439 --> 02:03:48,879
language that we would discover

3502
02:03:47,520 --> 02:03:50,719
the the reason that's really interesting

3503
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:53,760
to me is we have aliens

3504
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:54,719
here on earth japanese japanese is the

3505
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:57,280
obvious answer

3506
02:03:54,719 --> 02:03:59,599
japanese yeah that would be the common

3507
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:01,039
maybe it would be music actually

3508
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:02,800
that's more likely it wouldn't be a

3509
02:04:01,039 --> 02:04:04,399
language it would be art

3510
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:07,199
that they would communicate but you know

3511
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:08,879
i i do believe that we have

3512
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:11,439
i'm with stephen wolfram on this a

3513
02:04:08,880 --> 02:04:14,480
little bit that to me

3514
02:04:11,439 --> 02:04:16,479
computation like programs we write that

3515
02:04:14,479 --> 02:04:17,839
you know that they're kind of

3516
02:04:16,479 --> 02:04:19,198
intelligent creatures

3517
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:21,039
and i feel like we haven't found the

3518
02:04:19,198 --> 02:04:24,319
common language to talk with them

3519
02:04:21,039 --> 02:04:26,078
like our little creations that are

3520
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:28,238
artificial

3521
02:04:26,078 --> 02:04:29,439
are not born with the whatever that

3522
02:04:28,238 --> 02:04:32,559
innate thing that

3523
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:34,000
produces language with us and like

3524
02:04:32,560 --> 02:04:35,840
coming up with mechanisms for

3525
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:40,000
communicating with them

3526
02:04:35,840 --> 02:04:41,920
uh is um is an effort that feels

3527
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:43,520
like it will produce some incredible

3528
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:46,158
discoveries you can even think of

3529
02:04:43,520 --> 02:04:47,599
if you think that math is discovered

3530
02:04:46,158 --> 02:04:50,399
mathematics in itself

3531
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:51,360
is a kind of um oh yeah it's an innate

3532
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:54,719
construction

3533
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:56,559
of of the world we live in um i think we

3534
02:04:54,719 --> 02:05:00,679
are

3535
02:04:56,560 --> 02:05:03,520
you know a part of the way there because

3536
02:05:00,679 --> 02:05:06,399
pre-1950 right

3537
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:08,000
computers who were human beings that

3538
02:05:06,399 --> 02:05:11,920
would carry out arithmetic

3539
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:15,118
right and i think it was ulam um

3540
02:05:11,920 --> 02:05:16,480
who worked in los alamos at the at the

3541
02:05:15,118 --> 02:05:19,679
time like towards the end

3542
02:05:16,479 --> 02:05:20,078
of the second world war wrote something

3543
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:22,639
about

3544
02:05:20,078 --> 02:05:23,920
how you know in the future right

3545
02:05:22,639 --> 02:05:27,840
computers will not

3546
02:05:23,920 --> 02:05:29,118
be just arithmetic tool but will be

3547
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:32,159
truly an interactive

3548
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:34,960
you know thing with which you could

3549
02:05:32,158 --> 02:05:36,960
do experiments right at the time the

3550
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,118
notion of doing an experiment

3551
02:05:36,960 --> 02:05:40,158
not like in the lab with some beakers

3552
02:05:39,118 --> 02:05:42,719
but uh

3553
02:05:40,158 --> 02:05:43,679
an experiment on a computer designing an

3554
02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:47,039
experiment

3555
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:50,800
a numerical experiment was

3556
02:05:47,039 --> 02:05:53,359
a new one that's like you know 70

3557
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:53,920
of what i do is i design com you know i

3558
02:05:53,359 --> 02:05:57,519
write

3559
02:05:53,920 --> 02:06:00,880
code terrible code to be uh clear like

3560
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:03,119
but you know i write code that creates

3561
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:04,159
an experiment which is a which is a

3562
02:06:03,118 --> 02:06:06,799
simulation

3563
02:06:04,158 --> 02:06:08,479
so in that sense i think we're beginning

3564
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,760
to interact with the computer in in a

3565
02:06:08,479 --> 02:06:12,559
way that you're

3566
02:06:09,760 --> 02:06:14,239
saying not as just a you know fancy

3567
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:18,159
calculator not as just a

3568
02:06:14,238 --> 02:06:19,598
you know call-in request type of

3569
02:06:18,158 --> 02:06:21,839
thing but but you know something that

3570
02:06:19,599 --> 02:06:24,560
can generate uh

3571
02:06:21,840 --> 02:06:26,400
generate insights that are otherwise

3572
02:06:24,560 --> 02:06:27,679
completely unattainable right they're

3573
02:06:26,399 --> 02:06:30,319
unattainable by doing

3574
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:30,719
analytical mathematics yeah and there's

3575
02:06:30,319 --> 02:06:33,279
uh

3576
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:33,760
like with the alpha fold two we're now

3577
02:06:33,279 --> 02:06:36,319
trying

3578
02:06:33,760 --> 02:06:37,440
we're now starting to crack open biology

3579
02:06:36,319 --> 02:06:39,599
so being able to

3580
02:06:37,439 --> 02:06:41,039
simulate at first trivial biological

3581
02:06:39,599 --> 02:06:42,880
systems and hopefully down the line

3582
02:06:41,039 --> 02:06:45,279
complex biological systems

3583
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:46,239
right my hope is to be able to simulate

3584
02:06:45,279 --> 02:06:48,319
psychology

3585
02:06:46,238 --> 02:06:49,359
psychological like sociological systems

3586
02:06:48,319 --> 02:06:52,639
like humans

3587
02:06:49,359 --> 02:06:53,118
i've you know um a large part of my work

3588
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:56,239
at

3589
02:06:53,118 --> 02:06:57,598
mit was on autonomous vehicles

3590
02:06:56,238 --> 02:07:00,078
and the fascinating thing to me was

3591
02:06:57,599 --> 02:07:01,679
about pedestrians

3592
02:07:00,078 --> 02:07:03,439
human pedestrians interacting with

3593
02:07:01,679 --> 02:07:05,520
autonomous vehicles and simulating those

3594
02:07:03,439 --> 02:07:07,598
systems without murdering humans

3595
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:08,639
would be very useful but nevertheless is

3596
02:07:07,599 --> 02:07:10,480
exceptionally difficult

3597
02:07:08,639 --> 02:07:11,760
yeah i would say so when is my mustang

3598
02:07:10,479 --> 02:07:15,279
going to drive itself

3599
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:18,560
right i'm not even joking it looks like

3600
02:07:15,279 --> 02:07:19,279
yeah yeah i it turns out it's much

3601
02:07:18,560 --> 02:07:20,480
difficult

3602
02:07:19,279 --> 02:07:22,880
it's much more difficult than we

3603
02:07:20,479 --> 02:07:24,718
imagined yeah and and i suppose that's

3604
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:28,000
the kind of

3605
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:31,359
the progress of science is

3606
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:31,359
just like you know going to mars

3607
02:07:31,520 --> 02:07:35,280
it's probably going to turn out to be

3608
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:37,280
way more difficult to imagine

3609
02:07:35,279 --> 02:07:39,359
sending out probes to investigate planet

3610
02:07:37,279 --> 02:07:40,880
nine at the edge of our solar system

3611
02:07:39,359 --> 02:07:42,719
might turn out to be way more difficult

3612
02:07:40,880 --> 02:07:44,239
than we imagined but we do it anyway

3613
02:07:42,719 --> 02:07:45,760
yeah and we figure it out in the end

3614
02:07:44,238 --> 02:07:46,319
it's actually more of a great i mean

3615
02:07:45,760 --> 02:07:49,119
going

3616
02:07:46,319 --> 02:07:50,880
sending humans to mars is way more

3617
02:07:49,118 --> 02:07:51,359
complicated than huma sending humans to

3618
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:54,078
the moon

3619
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:55,118
you'd think just like naively yeah both

3620
02:07:54,078 --> 02:07:57,519
are in space

3621
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:58,479
who cares like if you go there why don't

3622
02:07:57,520 --> 02:08:01,599
you go there

3623
02:07:58,479 --> 02:08:04,158
um you know just

3624
02:08:01,599 --> 02:08:06,078
life support is uh is an extremely

3625
02:08:04,158 --> 02:08:07,920
expensive thing yeah there's a bunch of

3626
02:08:06,078 --> 02:08:09,679
extra challenges but i disagree with you

3627
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:10,880
i would be one of the early people to go

3628
02:08:09,679 --> 02:08:12,399
i used to think not

3629
02:08:10,880 --> 02:08:14,400
yeah i used to think i'd be one of the

3630
02:08:12,399 --> 02:08:15,839
first maybe million to go once you have

3631
02:08:14,399 --> 02:08:17,839
a little bit of a society

3632
02:08:15,840 --> 02:08:19,279
i think i'm i'm upgrading myself to the

3633
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:19,760
first like ten thousand yeah that's

3634
02:08:19,279 --> 02:08:22,078
right

3635
02:08:19,760 --> 02:08:23,039
from the front of the cabin not

3636
02:08:22,078 --> 02:08:25,599
completely front

3637
02:08:23,039 --> 02:08:26,639
but like it would be interesting to die

3638
02:08:25,599 --> 02:08:29,760
i'm okay

3639
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:33,279
with uh death sucks

3640
02:08:29,760 --> 02:08:34,000
but i kind of like the idea of dying on

3641
02:08:33,279 --> 02:08:36,639
mars

3642
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:38,158
of all the places to die i gotta say in

3643
02:08:36,639 --> 02:08:40,880
this regard like

3644
02:08:38,158 --> 02:08:42,399
i don't wanna die on mars i don't no no

3645
02:08:40,880 --> 02:08:46,239
i would much rather

3646
02:08:42,399 --> 02:08:48,479
die on earth uh i mean death

3647
02:08:46,238 --> 02:08:50,559
is is fundamentally boring right like

3648
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:52,559
death is a very boring experience

3649
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:54,239
but i mean i've never died before so i

3650
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:55,440
don't know from first-hand experience as

3651
02:08:54,238 --> 02:08:56,879
far as you know yeah

3652
02:08:55,439 --> 02:08:59,678
it could be a reincarnation all those

3653
02:08:56,880 --> 02:09:02,840
kinds of things so you mean uh

3654
02:08:59,679 --> 02:09:05,440
where would you die uh if you had to

3655
02:09:02,840 --> 02:09:08,078
choose oh man

3656
02:09:05,439 --> 02:09:08,799
um okay so and you know i would

3657
02:09:08,078 --> 02:09:10,719
definitely

3658
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:12,079
you know there's a question of who i'd

3659
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:15,198
want to die with

3660
02:09:12,078 --> 02:09:15,679
you know i'd prefer not to die alone uh

3661
02:09:15,198 --> 02:09:18,799
but like

3662
02:09:15,679 --> 02:09:22,800
you know surrounded by family would be

3663
02:09:18,800 --> 02:09:24,880
uh would be preferable where i think

3664
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:26,159
northern new mexico and i'm not even

3665
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:28,480
joking like this is not

3666
02:09:26,158 --> 02:09:31,359
a random place it's just like would that

3667
02:09:28,479 --> 02:09:33,759
be your favorite place on earth

3668
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:35,118
not necessarily like favorite place on

3669
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:38,480
earth to

3670
02:09:35,118 --> 02:09:39,198
to to reside you know indefinitely but

3671
02:09:38,479 --> 02:09:40,959
it is

3672
02:09:39,198 --> 02:09:42,799
it is one of the most beautiful places

3673
02:09:40,960 --> 02:09:46,000
i've i've ever been to

3674
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:48,320
uh so you know there's something i don't

3675
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:50,960
know there's something attractive about

3676
02:09:48,319 --> 02:09:52,719
about going you know returning to nature

3677
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:56,000
in a beautiful

3678
02:09:52,719 --> 02:09:57,359
uh place let me ask you about another

3679
02:09:56,000 --> 02:10:00,479
aspect of your life

3680
02:09:57,359 --> 02:10:02,078
that is full of beauty music okay you're

3681
02:10:00,479 --> 02:10:05,279
a musician

3682
02:10:02,078 --> 02:10:07,679
uh the absurd question i have to ask

3683
02:10:05,279 --> 02:10:09,039
what is the greatest song of all time oh

3684
02:10:07,679 --> 02:10:11,520
objectively speaking

3685
02:10:09,039 --> 02:10:12,319
the greatest song of all time i suppose

3686
02:10:11,520 --> 02:10:14,880
that could change

3687
02:10:12,319 --> 02:10:16,399
moment to moment day to day but if you

3688
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:18,239
were forced to answer for this

3689
02:10:16,399 --> 02:10:20,319
particular moment in your life that's

3690
02:10:18,238 --> 02:10:22,078
something that pops to mind

3691
02:10:20,319 --> 02:10:23,840
this could be both philosophically this

3692
02:10:22,078 --> 02:10:24,559
could be technically as a musician like

3693
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:27,360
what you enjoy

3694
02:10:24,560 --> 02:10:29,119
maybe lyrics like for me it's lyrics is

3695
02:10:27,359 --> 02:10:32,078
very important so absolutely i would

3696
02:10:29,118 --> 02:10:32,559
probably be my choice would be lyrics

3697
02:10:32,078 --> 02:10:34,238
based

3698
02:10:32,560 --> 02:10:36,159
i don't want to answer in terms of just

3699
02:10:34,238 --> 02:10:38,718
technical uh you know

3700
02:10:36,158 --> 02:10:40,078
technical prowess i think technical

3701
02:10:38,719 --> 02:10:42,639
prowess is

3702
02:10:40,078 --> 02:10:44,799
impressive right it's just like it's

3703
02:10:42,639 --> 02:10:46,560
impressive what can be done

3704
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:49,119
i wouldn't place that into the category

3705
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:52,159
of the greatest music ever written

3706
02:10:49,118 --> 02:10:54,799
some the classical music uh

3707
02:10:52,158 --> 02:10:56,238
that's that's written is undeniably

3708
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:59,360
beautiful but i don't want to

3709
02:10:56,238 --> 02:11:02,238
consider that category of music

3710
02:10:59,359 --> 02:11:03,118
either uh just because you know so if i

3711
02:11:02,238 --> 02:11:06,559
if i have to

3712
02:11:03,118 --> 02:11:10,238
limit uh the scope of this

3713
02:11:06,560 --> 02:11:11,840
philosophical discussion uh to

3714
02:11:10,238 --> 02:11:14,638
you know the kind of music that i listen

3715
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:17,599
to you know probably what's my age again

3716
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:18,400
by blink 182. it's just you know it's a

3717
02:11:17,599 --> 02:11:21,520
solid one

3718
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:24,960
it's got you know

3719
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:27,280
said nobody ever that's a good song

3720
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:28,960
i don't know if you're joking no i i i

3721
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:29,599
am joking it's a good one but it's it

3722
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:32,000
was

3723
02:11:29,599 --> 02:11:32,000
yeah i mean

3724
02:11:35,039 --> 02:11:38,960
what's my age you get yeah yeah no i

3725
02:11:38,238 --> 02:11:41,439
mean

3726
02:11:38,960 --> 02:11:43,439
it would probably you know

3727
02:11:41,439 --> 02:11:44,078
songwriting-wise i think the beatles

3728
02:11:43,439 --> 02:11:46,559
came

3729
02:11:44,078 --> 02:11:47,599
pretty close to the influential to you i

3730
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:50,840
was like the beatles

3731
02:11:47,599 --> 02:11:54,000
yeah love the beatles i love the beatles

3732
02:11:50,840 --> 02:11:55,760
uh let it be yesterday yeah

3733
02:11:54,000 --> 02:11:57,118
like straw i think strawberry feels

3734
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:58,880
forever is is one

3735
02:11:57,118 --> 02:12:01,118
you know what what one of my favorite

3736
02:11:58,880 --> 02:12:03,760
beetle songs is it's uh

3737
02:12:01,118 --> 02:12:05,359
you know in my life right that's not

3738
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:08,480
it's it's hard to imagine

3739
02:12:05,359 --> 02:12:11,359
how whatever 24 year old

3740
02:12:08,479 --> 02:12:12,718
wrote that it is one of the most uh

3741
02:12:11,359 --> 02:12:15,839
introspective

3742
02:12:12,719 --> 02:12:17,599
pieces of music ever you know i'm a huge

3743
02:12:15,840 --> 02:12:20,319
pink floyd fan

3744
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:22,000
and so i think you know if you were to

3745
02:12:20,319 --> 02:12:23,840
you can sort of look at the entire dark

3746
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:27,520
side of the moon album

3747
02:12:23,840 --> 02:12:29,199
and as you know getting pretty close up

3748
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:29,760
there to the pinnacle of what you know

3749
02:12:29,198 --> 02:12:33,198
can be

3750
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:35,840
created so you know time's a great song

3751
02:12:33,198 --> 02:12:36,319
yeah it's a great song just the entirety

3752
02:12:35,840 --> 02:12:39,440
of

3753
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:40,158
just the instruments the lyrics the the

3754
02:12:39,439 --> 02:12:44,479
the feeling

3755
02:12:40,158 --> 02:12:47,198
created by a song like pink floyd

3756
02:12:44,479 --> 02:12:48,559
can create feelings the entire

3757
02:12:47,198 --> 02:12:49,118
experience i mean you have that with the

3758
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:52,880
wall

3759
02:12:49,118 --> 02:12:53,679
of just uh transporting you into another

3760
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:56,000
place

3761
02:12:53,679 --> 02:12:57,039
songs don't not many songs could do that

3762
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:59,198
as as

3763
02:12:57,039 --> 02:13:00,399
well not many artists can do that as

3764
02:12:59,198 --> 02:13:02,319
well as pink floyd did

3765
02:13:00,399 --> 02:13:04,319
there are a lot of bands that you can

3766
02:13:02,319 --> 02:13:07,439
kind of say oh yeah

3767
02:13:04,319 --> 02:13:07,840
like if you take blink 182 right if you

3768
02:13:07,439 --> 02:13:10,960
have

3769
02:13:07,840 --> 02:13:13,039
no idea like if you are listening to

3770
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:14,158
sort of that type of pop punk for the

3771
02:13:13,039 --> 02:13:15,840
first time

3772
02:13:14,158 --> 02:13:18,078
it's difficult to differentiate between

3773
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:21,119
blink 182 and like some 41

3774
02:13:18,078 --> 02:13:23,840
and the thousand of other like

3775
02:13:21,118 --> 02:13:25,198
lesser known bands that all sounded the

3776
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,319
whole they all had that sparkling

3777
02:13:25,198 --> 02:13:28,960
production

3778
02:13:26,319 --> 02:13:30,000
uh feel they all kind of sounded the

3779
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:33,920
same

3780
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:35,520
right when with pink floyd

3781
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:37,920
it's hard to find another band that

3782
02:13:35,520 --> 02:13:40,239
you're like well is this one

3783
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:41,679
pink floor like you know yeah when

3784
02:13:40,238 --> 02:13:43,439
you're listening to that

3785
02:13:41,679 --> 02:13:45,359
what you're listening to that the

3786
02:13:43,439 --> 02:13:47,839
uniqueness that that's fascinating

3787
02:13:45,359 --> 02:13:48,479
you know in the calculation of the

3788
02:13:47,840 --> 02:13:51,360
greatest

3789
02:13:48,479 --> 02:13:52,718
song in the greatest band of all time

3790
02:13:51,359 --> 02:13:54,479
you could probably

3791
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:56,639
you probably actually quantify this like

3792
02:13:54,479 --> 02:13:59,439
scientifically is like

3793
02:13:56,639 --> 02:14:00,800
how unique uh if you play different

3794
02:13:59,439 --> 02:14:02,479
songs how well are people

3795
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:05,199
able to recognize whether it's this band

3796
02:14:02,479 --> 02:14:07,118
or not and that you know that's

3797
02:14:05,198 --> 02:14:09,118
probably a huge component to greatness

3798
02:14:07,118 --> 02:14:10,399
like if the world would miss it if it

3799
02:14:09,118 --> 02:14:14,078
was gone

3800
02:14:10,399 --> 02:14:16,238
yes yes so but there's also the human

3801
02:14:14,078 --> 02:14:19,439
story things like i would say output

3802
02:14:16,238 --> 02:14:21,919
johnny cash's cover of hurt as one of

3803
02:14:19,439 --> 02:14:24,479
the greatest songs of all time

3804
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:26,239
and that has less to do with the song

3805
02:14:24,479 --> 02:14:27,919
but your interaction with the

3806
02:14:26,238 --> 02:14:29,678
interaction with it but also the human

3807
02:14:27,920 --> 02:14:31,599
the full story of the human

3808
02:14:29,679 --> 02:14:33,359
so like it's not just if i just heard

3809
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:36,719
the song it'd be like okay

3810
02:14:33,359 --> 02:14:38,639
that but if it it's the full story of it

3811
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:40,158
also the video component for that

3812
02:14:38,639 --> 02:14:42,560
particular song

3813
02:14:40,158 --> 02:14:43,920
so like that you can't discount the full

3814
02:14:42,560 --> 02:14:45,840
experience of it

3815
02:14:43,920 --> 02:14:47,599
absolutely you know i have no confusion

3816
02:14:45,840 --> 02:14:51,279
about not

3817
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:54,078
about being you know anywhere uh

3818
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:54,880
you know in in that league but i just

3819
02:14:54,078 --> 02:14:56,479
like i

3820
02:14:54,880 --> 02:14:58,719
sometimes think about you know music

3821
02:14:56,479 --> 02:15:02,319
that is being

3822
02:14:58,719 --> 02:15:04,319
uh produced today feels

3823
02:15:02,319 --> 02:15:06,719
oftentimes feels like like kind of

3824
02:15:04,319 --> 02:15:10,719
clothes like clothes that you buy

3825
02:15:06,719 --> 02:15:12,960
at like h m and you wear three times

3826
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:15,118
before they rip and you throw away so

3827
02:15:12,960 --> 02:15:16,960
like so much of it is

3828
02:15:15,118 --> 02:15:18,559
it's not bad it's just kind of

3829
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:20,719
forgettable right

3830
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:21,599
like the fact that we're talking about

3831
02:15:20,719 --> 02:15:25,599
pink floyd

3832
02:15:21,599 --> 02:15:27,039
in 2021 is in itself an interesting

3833
02:15:25,599 --> 02:15:28,960
uh question why are we talking about

3834
02:15:27,039 --> 02:15:30,719
pink floyd and it's there's something

3835
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:33,039
unforgettable about them and

3836
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:34,158
unforgettable about the the art that

3837
02:15:33,039 --> 02:15:36,078
they created

3838
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:37,839
that could be the markets that like so

3839
02:15:36,078 --> 02:15:41,118
spotify has created this kind of

3840
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:43,520
market where the the

3841
02:15:41,118 --> 02:15:45,279
incentives for creating music that last

3842
02:15:43,520 --> 02:15:47,280
is much lower because there's so much

3843
02:15:45,279 --> 02:15:49,439
more music right you just want something

3844
02:15:47,279 --> 02:15:50,238
that shines bright for a short amount of

3845
02:15:49,439 --> 02:15:52,399
time

3846
02:15:50,238 --> 02:15:53,598
makes a lot of money and moves on and i

3847
02:15:52,399 --> 02:15:54,960
mean the same thing you see with the

3848
02:15:53,599 --> 02:15:56,159
news and all those kinds of things we're

3849
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:59,279
just living in a

3850
02:15:56,158 --> 02:16:01,679
shorter and shorter shorter like uh time

3851
02:15:59,279 --> 02:16:05,118
scale in terms of our attention spans

3852
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:06,880
and that um nevertheless when we look at

3853
02:16:05,118 --> 02:16:09,118
the long arc of history of music perhaps

3854
02:16:06,880 --> 02:16:11,520
there will be some songs from today

3855
02:16:09,118 --> 02:16:13,198
that will last as much as pink floyd

3856
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:14,639
we're just unable to see it

3857
02:16:13,198 --> 02:16:16,238
yeah just the collected works of

3858
02:16:14,639 --> 02:16:18,159
nickelback

3859
02:16:16,238 --> 02:16:19,839
exactly you know you never know you

3860
02:16:18,158 --> 02:16:21,118
never know justin bieber

3861
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:22,239
it could have yeah he could be a

3862
02:16:21,118 --> 02:16:23,359
contender i've recently started

3863
02:16:22,238 --> 02:16:24,638
listening to justin bieber just

3864
02:16:23,359 --> 02:16:25,118
understand what people are talking about

3865
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:26,639
and

3866
02:16:25,118 --> 02:16:28,799
you know i'll just keep my comments to

3867
02:16:26,639 --> 02:16:29,440
myself on that one it's too good to

3868
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:32,639
explain

3869
02:16:29,439 --> 02:16:35,760
in the words we're not

3870
02:16:32,638 --> 02:16:37,518
the greatness that is the biebs uh you

3871
02:16:35,760 --> 02:16:40,398
as a musician

3872
02:16:37,519 --> 02:16:41,359
so you uh you write your own music you

3873
02:16:40,398 --> 02:16:44,718
uh play guitar

3874
02:16:41,359 --> 02:16:47,920
you sing um maybe can you

3875
02:16:44,718 --> 02:16:49,358
give an overview of the role music is

3876
02:16:47,920 --> 02:16:51,200
played in your life you're

3877
02:16:49,359 --> 02:16:52,479
one of the you're a world-class

3878
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:55,120
scientist

3879
02:16:52,478 --> 02:16:57,599
and so it's kind of fascinating to see

3880
02:16:55,120 --> 02:16:57,599
somebody

3881
02:16:58,799 --> 02:17:01,920
in your position who's also a great

3882
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:04,558
musician and

3883
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:06,079
and and uh still loves playing music

3884
02:17:04,558 --> 02:17:06,638
yeah well i wouldn't call myself a great

3885
02:17:06,079 --> 02:17:08,159
musician

3886
02:17:06,638 --> 02:17:10,718
like you know one of the best of all

3887
02:17:08,159 --> 02:17:10,718
time yeah

3888
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:15,200
that's right like we were saying offline

3889
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:16,319
confidence is like the most essential

3890
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:18,960
thing about that's right

3891
02:17:16,318 --> 02:17:19,439
exactly it's the confidence and kind of

3892
02:17:18,959 --> 02:17:22,959
like

3893
02:17:19,439 --> 02:17:26,239
moodiness right yeah um yeah look i mean

3894
02:17:22,959 --> 02:17:29,039
music plays an absolutely

3895
02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:30,159
essential role in in everything i do

3896
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:33,359
because

3897
02:17:30,159 --> 02:17:36,000
i lose if i stop playing for

3898
02:17:33,359 --> 02:17:36,960
one reason or another say i'm traveling

3899
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:39,760
i notably

3900
02:17:36,959 --> 02:17:40,638
lose creativity in every other aspect of

3901
02:17:39,760 --> 02:17:44,159
my life

3902
02:17:40,638 --> 02:17:47,358
right there's something i don't

3903
02:17:44,159 --> 02:17:49,359
view you know playing music as a

3904
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:51,200
separate endeavor from doing science or

3905
02:17:49,359 --> 02:17:53,840
doing doing whatever it's all

3906
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:54,319
it's all part of that same creative

3907
02:17:53,840 --> 02:17:58,639
thing

3908
02:17:54,318 --> 02:18:02,718
which is distinct from i don't know

3909
02:17:58,638 --> 02:18:04,558
uh pressing a button or like you know so

3910
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:06,879
it's not a break from science it's

3911
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:07,599
a part of your science it's absolutely a

3912
02:18:06,879 --> 02:18:10,398
it's a part of

3913
02:18:07,599 --> 02:18:12,239
it's it's i would say you know it's a

3914
02:18:10,398 --> 02:18:14,959
thing that enables

3915
02:18:12,239 --> 02:18:15,280
the science right the science would you

3916
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:18,000
know

3917
02:18:15,280 --> 02:18:19,200
suck even more than it does already uh

3918
02:18:18,000 --> 02:18:20,959
without the music

3919
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:22,559
and that means like the creating of the

3920
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:24,318
the writing of the music or is it just

3921
02:18:22,558 --> 02:18:26,959
even playing other people's stuff is it

3922
02:18:24,318 --> 02:18:28,318
is it all of it yeah it's it's

3923
02:18:26,959 --> 02:18:31,839
definitely both

3924
02:18:28,318 --> 02:18:35,199

my screeching singing you know and uh

3929
02:18:42,718 --> 02:18:46,398

3934
02:18:51,439 --> 02:18:55,200
super busy

3935
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:57,200
is there something you could say about

3936
02:18:55,200 --> 02:18:59,679
practicing

3937
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:00,800
uh for musicians for guitar for you're

3938
02:18:59,679 --> 02:19:03,359

so like that whole how you can manage

3940
02:19:03,359 --> 02:19:08,239
that is there some tricks or

3941
02:19:04,879 --> 02:19:08,959
some hacks to um being a lifelong

3942
02:19:08,239 --> 02:19:11,519
musician

3943
02:19:08,959 --> 02:19:12,079
while being like super busy so i would

3944
02:19:11,519 --> 02:19:15,519
say

3945
02:19:12,079 --> 02:19:19,200
you know the way that i optimize

3946
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:20,880
um my life is i try to i try to do

3947
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:22,960
you know the thing that i'm passionate

3948
02:19:20,879 --> 02:19:24,799
about in a moment

3949
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:27,518
um and put that at the top of the

3950
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:29,518
priority list there are moments when

3951
02:19:27,519 --> 02:19:31,200
you know you just you feel inspired to

3952
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:32,719
play music and if you're in the middle

3953
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:35,120
of something if you can avoid

3954
02:19:32,718 --> 02:19:36,718
if that can be put on hold just do it

3955
02:19:35,120 --> 02:19:39,359
right there are times when you

3956
02:19:36,718 --> 02:19:40,478
get inspired about something scientific

3957
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:43,519
um

3958
02:19:40,478 --> 02:19:46,879
you know i do my best to drop

3959
02:19:43,519 --> 02:19:48,719
everything go into that you know mode of

3960
02:19:46,879 --> 02:19:51,839
that isolated mode

3961
02:19:48,719 --> 02:19:54,239
and and execute upon that so

3962
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:55,840
it's a chaotic you know i think i have a

3963
02:19:54,239 --> 02:19:58,639
pretty chaotic lifestyle

3964
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:02,079
where i'm always doing kind of multiple

3965
02:19:58,639 --> 02:20:04,079
things and jumping between uh

3966
02:20:02,079 --> 02:20:05,200
between what i'm doing but at the end of

3967
02:20:04,079 --> 02:20:08,879
the day

3968
02:20:05,200 --> 02:20:10,960
it's it's not like um

3969
02:20:08,879 --> 02:20:12,799
you know those those moments of

3970
02:20:10,959 --> 02:20:14,799
inspiration

3971
02:20:12,799 --> 02:20:16,159
are actually kind of rare right like

3972
02:20:14,799 --> 02:20:19,920
most of the time

3973
02:20:16,159 --> 02:20:21,840
all of us are just doing kind of uh

3974
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:24,000
doing the stuff that get that needs to

3975
02:20:21,840 --> 02:20:26,318
get done if you

3976
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,079
do the disservice to yourself of saying

3977
02:20:26,318 --> 02:20:30,079
oh i'm inspired to

3978
02:20:28,079 --> 02:20:31,280
you know do this calculation figure it

3979
02:20:30,079 --> 02:20:33,680
figure this out

3980
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:34,800
but i've got to answer email or just

3981
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:38,398
like do something

3982
02:20:34,799 --> 02:20:40,719
something silly um you know that is a

3983
02:20:38,398 --> 02:20:41,680
um that is nothing more than the service

3984
02:20:40,719 --> 02:20:44,959
and also

3985
02:20:41,680 --> 02:20:48,159
like i have some social media presence

3986
02:20:44,959 --> 02:20:50,639
but i i mostly stay off of you know

3987
02:20:48,159 --> 02:20:53,520
social media

3988
02:20:50,639 --> 02:20:54,159
to you know just frankly because like i

3989
02:20:53,520 --> 02:20:56,840
don't kind of

3990
02:20:54,159 --> 02:20:59,039
i don't enjoy the mental cycles that it

3991
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:01,920
uh yeah it robs you of that

3992
02:20:59,040 --> 02:21:02,880
the yeah yeah those those precious

3993
02:21:01,920 --> 02:21:05,040
moments

3994
02:21:02,879 --> 02:21:07,119
that could be filled with inspiration in

3995
02:21:05,040 --> 02:21:10,160
your in your other pursuits

3996
02:21:07,120 --> 02:21:12,000
um but there's something to maybe you

3997
02:21:10,159 --> 02:21:14,799
and i are different this like i i try to

3998
02:21:12,000 --> 02:21:16,719
play at least 10 minutes of guitar every

3999
02:21:14,799 --> 02:21:20,000
day

4000
02:21:16,719 --> 02:21:24,239
like almost on the technical side like

4001
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:27,520
keeping that bass uh of

4002
02:21:24,239 --> 02:21:29,439
of basic competence going and

4003
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:31,280
i mean the same way like writers will

4004
02:21:29,439 --> 02:21:34,000
get in front of a paper no matter what

4005
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:35,040
that kind of thing it just feels like

4006
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:38,079
that

4007
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:41,120
for my life has been essential to to to

4008
02:21:38,079 --> 02:21:43,200
the daily ritual of it otherwise days

4009
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:44,560
turn into weeks weeks or into months and

4010
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:48,240
you haven't played guitar for

4011
02:21:44,559 --> 02:21:51,279
months no no i i i understand for me

4012
02:21:48,239 --> 02:21:52,398
i think it's it's been like if we have a

4013
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:55,040
gig coming up

4014
02:21:52,398 --> 02:21:55,599
we'll definitely yeah that's right no

4015
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:59,359
like we

4016
02:21:55,600 --> 02:22:02,399
we will uh we will sharpen up uh

4017
02:21:59,359 --> 02:22:03,840
definitely you know especially co coming

4018
02:22:02,398 --> 02:22:06,079
up to again it's like

4019
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:07,600
you know we're not trying to make money

4020
02:22:06,079 --> 02:22:11,120
with this this is like just

4021
02:22:07,600 --> 02:22:13,120
for the uh for that satisfaction of

4022
02:22:11,120 --> 02:22:17,600
doing something doing something well

4023
02:22:13,120 --> 02:22:22,000
right um but overall

4024
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:25,120
i would say most i play guitar most days

4025
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,840
most days and you know when i put kids

4026
02:22:25,120 --> 02:22:28,800
to sleep

4027
02:22:25,840 --> 02:22:29,760
i i play guitar you know with them and

4028
02:22:28,799 --> 02:22:33,519
we like

4029
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:35,120
just make up random songs about you know

4030
02:22:33,520 --> 02:22:36,560
about her a cat or something you know

4031
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:39,520
like we just

4032
02:22:36,559 --> 02:22:41,760
do kind of random stuff but you know

4033
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:43,840
music is always involved in that process

4034
02:22:41,760 --> 02:22:45,439
yeah keeping it fun you have russian

4035
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:47,920
roots i sure do

4036
02:22:45,439 --> 02:22:49,200
were you born in russia i was yeah when

4037
02:22:47,920 --> 02:22:53,040
did you come here

4038
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:56,240
so i came to the us in

4039
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:59,520
very the very end of 99 but um

4040
02:22:56,239 --> 02:23:02,639
so i was like almost 14 years old

4041
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:04,319
but along the way we spent six years in

4042
02:23:02,639 --> 02:23:07,760
japan so like we moved

4043
02:23:04,318 --> 02:23:10,959
from russia to japan in 94

4044
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:12,000
and then to the us in 99 so like

4045
02:23:10,959 --> 02:23:14,799
elementary school

4046
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:16,159
all interesting school in japan so

4047
02:23:14,799 --> 02:23:19,279
elementary school in japan

4048
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:20,559
yeah so that's interesting that do you

4049
02:23:19,280 --> 02:23:23,680
still speak russian

4050
02:23:20,559 --> 02:23:23,680
sure okay

4051
02:23:23,760 --> 02:23:29,200
okay maybe i'll uh let me ask you in

4052
02:23:26,799 --> 02:23:29,199
russian

4053
02:23:30,840 --> 02:23:33,840
um

4054
02:23:37,159 --> 02:23:40,190
[Music]

4055
02:23:58,879 --> 02:24:01,839
is

4056
02:24:26,840 --> 02:24:29,840
is

4057
02:24:28,629 --> 02:24:31,679
[Laughter]

4058
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:32,960
so for people who don't speak russian

4059
02:24:31,680 --> 02:24:36,000
constantine was uh

4060
02:24:32,959 --> 02:24:39,039
talking about basically his first in

4061
02:24:36,000 --> 02:24:41,760
1992 interaction with capitalism

4062
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:43,520
which is pepsi and at first he

4063
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:45,520
discovered pepsi and then he discovered

4064
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:48,720
coke and he was confused how such

4065
02:24:45,520 --> 02:24:50,399
uh how such theft could occur

4066
02:24:48,719 --> 02:24:52,478
like an intellectual property theft and

4067
02:24:50,398 --> 02:24:55,039
remember pepsi

4068
02:24:52,478 --> 02:24:56,079
arrived to the soviet union first and

4069
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:58,319
there's some

4070
02:24:56,079 --> 02:24:59,439
there's some complicated story which i

4071
02:24:58,318 --> 02:25:01,039
don't uh

4072
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:02,479
quite understand the details of for a

4073
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:06,319
while pepsi

4074
02:25:02,478 --> 02:25:08,398
like commanded submarines or something

4075
02:25:06,318 --> 02:25:09,439
yeah pepsi had like a fleet of soviet

4076
02:25:08,398 --> 02:25:12,719
submarines that

4077
02:25:09,439 --> 02:25:14,398
did they were sponsoring tanks and

4078
02:25:12,719 --> 02:25:15,840
this fascinating yeah and i and i

4079
02:25:14,398 --> 02:25:17,439
remember there's certain things that

4080
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:18,478
trickled in like mcdonald's i remember

4081
02:25:17,439 --> 02:25:20,639
that was a big deal

4082
02:25:18,478 --> 02:25:22,239
oh yeah certainly for the west

4083
02:25:20,639 --> 02:25:23,439
absolutely so i mean we went to

4084
02:25:22,239 --> 02:25:26,239
mcdonald's

4085
02:25:23,439 --> 02:25:27,200
and we stood on i mean this is this is

4086
02:25:26,239 --> 02:25:29,840
absurd

4087
02:25:27,200 --> 02:25:31,200
right from kind of looking at it from

4088
02:25:29,840 --> 02:25:33,120
today's

4089
02:25:31,200 --> 02:25:34,720
perspective but we stood in line for

4090
02:25:33,120 --> 02:25:35,920
like six hours to get into this

4091
02:25:34,719 --> 02:25:39,438
mcdonald's

4092
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:42,559
and i remember inside i was just like

4093
02:25:39,439 --> 02:25:42,960
a billion people and i'm just taking a

4094
02:25:42,559 --> 02:25:46,799
bite

4095
02:25:42,959 --> 02:25:48,879
out of that big mac like wow

4096
02:25:46,799 --> 02:25:50,079
what was it an incredible experience for

4097
02:25:48,879 --> 02:25:52,398
you so like

4098
02:25:50,079 --> 02:25:53,359
what is this taste of the west like uh

4099
02:25:52,398 --> 02:25:57,039
did you enjoy it

4100
02:25:53,359 --> 02:25:57,520
i enjoyed the fact that i mean this is

4101
02:25:57,040 --> 02:25:59,280
like

4102
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:00,560
i was getting into the weeds but i

4103
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:02,319
really enjoyed

4104
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:04,318
the fact that the top of the bun had

4105
02:26:02,318 --> 02:26:06,959
those seeds you know like

4106
02:26:04,318 --> 02:26:07,439
and i remember how on the commercials

4107
02:26:06,959 --> 02:26:09,839
like the

4108
02:26:07,439 --> 02:26:11,760
big mac would kind of bounce i was like

4109
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:14,318
the seeds how did they inject the seeds

4110
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:17,680
into the bread like

4111
02:26:14,318 --> 02:26:20,159
amazing right so i think it was uh

4112
02:26:17,680 --> 02:26:21,280
artistry yeah you enjoyed the artistry

4113
02:26:20,159 --> 02:26:23,840
of the culinary

4114
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:25,600
exactly it was the you know it was the

4115
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:25,920
food art that kind of that is the big

4116
02:26:25,600 --> 02:26:27,120
mac

4117
02:26:25,920 --> 02:26:28,799
actually i still don't know the answer

4118
02:26:27,120 --> 02:26:31,439
to that how do they get the sesame seeds

4119
02:26:28,799 --> 02:26:33,358
on the better to not know the answer

4120
02:26:31,439 --> 02:26:34,800
you just wander at the mystery of it all

4121
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:35,920
yeah i remember it being exceptionally

4122
02:26:34,799 --> 02:26:39,358
delicious but i

4123
02:26:35,920 --> 02:26:41,760
i'm with you i don't know you didn't

4124
02:26:39,359 --> 02:26:44,159
mention how transformative pepsi was but

4125
02:26:41,760 --> 02:26:47,680
to me basically sugar-based stuff

4126
02:26:44,159 --> 02:26:49,200
like like pepsi was uh or a coke i don't

4127
02:26:47,680 --> 02:26:51,040
remember which one we partook in but

4128
02:26:49,200 --> 02:26:51,520
that was an incredible experience yeah

4129
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:54,640
yeah

4130
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:58,079
yeah yeah no absolutely and uh

4131
02:26:54,639 --> 02:27:00,840
you know i think it's um

4132
02:26:58,079 --> 02:27:04,000
you know it was an important and and

4133
02:27:00,840 --> 02:27:06,719
formative uh formative period

4134
02:27:04,000 --> 02:27:07,280
i sometimes i guess rely on that a

4135
02:27:06,719 --> 02:27:10,318
little bit

4136
02:27:07,280 --> 02:27:14,079
uh you know in my daily life because uh

4137
02:27:10,318 --> 02:27:16,239
i remember like the early 90s were real

4138
02:27:14,079 --> 02:27:19,039
rough you know like my

4139
02:27:16,239 --> 02:27:19,600
parents were kind of on the on the

4140
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:22,880
bottom

4141
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:25,760
of the spectrum in terms of uh

4142
02:27:22,879 --> 02:27:27,519
you know in terms of financial

4143
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:31,040
well-being so

4144
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:34,560
um kind of like just when i

4145
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:36,319
run into trouble not like you know

4146
02:27:34,559 --> 02:27:38,318
money trouble just any kind of trouble

4147
02:27:36,318 --> 02:27:41,439
these days it just kind of

4148
02:27:38,318 --> 02:27:43,359
is not uh particularly meaningful

4149
02:27:41,439 --> 02:27:44,639
when you compare it to that that

4150
02:27:43,359 --> 02:27:47,280
turbulent time of the

4151
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:49,358
early 90s and the other thing is i think

4152
02:27:47,280 --> 02:27:52,479
there's there's like an advantage

4153
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:53,040
to to being you know an immigrant which

4154
02:27:52,478 --> 02:27:55,840
is that

4155
02:27:53,040 --> 02:27:56,800
you get you go through the mental

4156
02:27:55,840 --> 02:27:59,520
exercise

4157
02:27:56,799 --> 02:28:02,000
of changing your environment completely

4158
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:04,960
early in your life right you go

4159
02:28:02,000 --> 02:28:07,200
it's by no means you know pleasant in

4160
02:28:04,959 --> 02:28:08,959
the moment right but like going

4161
02:28:07,200 --> 02:28:11,040
into japanese elementary school right

4162
02:28:08,959 --> 02:28:14,159
like i didn't go to a

4163
02:28:11,040 --> 02:28:16,080
some like private you know

4164
02:28:14,159 --> 02:28:18,239
thing i just went to a regular like

4165
02:28:16,079 --> 02:28:19,600
japanese public elementary school and i

4166
02:28:18,239 --> 02:28:22,639
was the

4167
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:24,880
non-japanese person in my class

4168
02:28:22,639 --> 02:28:26,239
so just like the learning japanese and

4169
02:28:24,879 --> 02:28:28,559
just kind of

4170
02:28:26,239 --> 02:28:30,559
so that's a super humbling experience in

4171
02:28:28,559 --> 02:28:31,680
many ways was when you like made fun of

4172
02:28:30,559 --> 02:28:34,398
all that kind of stuff oh

4173
02:28:31,680 --> 02:28:34,720
yeah being the outsider oh absolutely

4174
02:28:34,398 --> 02:28:37,199
but

4175
02:28:34,719 --> 02:28:37,920
you know you kind of do you kind of do

4176
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:41,359
that

4177
02:28:37,920 --> 02:28:43,359
and then you kind of then you just

4178
02:28:41,359 --> 02:28:44,800
kind of are okay with with stuff you

4179
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:46,640
know what i mean and so

4180
02:28:44,799 --> 02:28:47,920
like doing that again in middle school

4181
02:28:46,639 --> 02:28:51,119
in the us

4182
02:28:47,920 --> 02:28:53,040
it was arguably easy because i was like

4183
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:54,160
yeah well i've already done this before

4184
02:28:53,040 --> 02:28:56,080
so

4185
02:28:54,159 --> 02:28:57,280
i think it kind of prepares you mentally

4186
02:28:56,079 --> 02:28:59,439
a little bit for

4187
02:28:57,280 --> 02:29:01,040
for switching up for whatever you know

4188
02:28:59,439 --> 02:29:01,840
changes that will come up for the rest

4189
02:29:01,040 --> 02:29:05,359
of

4190
02:29:01,840 --> 02:29:08,398
your life so i um i wouldn't trade

4191
02:29:05,359 --> 02:29:11,600
that that experience really for anything

4192
02:29:08,398 --> 02:29:12,478
it's a huge aspect of who i am and i'm

4193
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:15,600
sure

4194
02:29:12,478 --> 02:29:16,639
you can relate to a lot of this yes is

4195
02:29:15,600 --> 02:29:18,479
there advice

4196
02:29:16,639 --> 02:29:20,318
from your life that you can give to

4197
02:29:18,478 --> 02:29:23,199
young people today

4198
02:29:20,318 --> 02:29:24,239
high school college you know about their

4199
02:29:23,200 --> 02:29:27,200
career

4200
02:29:24,239 --> 02:29:27,600
or maybe about life in general i'm not

4201
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:30,399
like

4202
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:32,079
a career coach but i like that's right

4203
02:29:30,398 --> 02:29:33,599
like i'm definitely not a life coach i

4204
02:29:32,079 --> 02:29:36,879
don't have it all figured out

4205
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:40,479
but i think there's a um

4206
02:29:36,879 --> 02:29:43,599
there's a perpetual cycle of of

4207
02:29:40,478 --> 02:29:45,920
um you know thinking that

4208
02:29:43,600 --> 02:29:48,000
there is a um there's kind of like a

4209
02:29:45,920 --> 02:29:51,280
template for success

4210
02:29:48,000 --> 02:29:56,079
right maybe there is but i in my

4211
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:56,079
experience i haven't seen it right um

4212
02:29:56,239 --> 02:29:59,359
you know i would say people in high

4213
02:29:58,879 --> 02:30:02,879
school

4214
02:29:59,359 --> 02:30:05,680
right so much of their focus

4215
02:30:02,879 --> 02:30:06,159
is on getting straight a's filling their

4216
02:30:05,680 --> 02:30:08,239
cv

4217
02:30:06,159 --> 02:30:09,840
with this and this and this so that it

4218
02:30:08,239 --> 02:30:13,280
looks impressive

4219
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:16,239
right um that that is

4220
02:30:13,280 --> 02:30:16,640
not i think a good way to optimize your

4221
02:30:16,239 --> 02:30:19,119
life

4222
02:30:16,639 --> 02:30:20,398
right do the thing that fills your life

4223
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:22,720
with passion

4224
02:30:20,398 --> 02:30:24,478
do the thing that fills your life with

4225
02:30:22,719 --> 02:30:28,239
with interest

4226
02:30:24,478 --> 02:30:31,599
and you know do that perpetually right

4227
02:30:28,239 --> 02:30:34,719
a straight a student you know

4228
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:38,000
is really impressive but also you know

4229
02:30:34,719 --> 02:30:39,199
somewhat boring right so so i i think

4230
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:42,318
you know injection of

4231
02:30:39,200 --> 02:30:44,399
more of that kind of um

4232
02:30:42,318 --> 02:30:46,478
interest into into the lives of young

4233
02:30:44,398 --> 02:30:49,840
people would go a long way

4234
02:30:46,478 --> 02:30:50,559
in in just both upping their level of

4235
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:53,760
happiness

4236
02:30:50,559 --> 02:30:56,559
and then just kind of ensuring that

4237
02:30:53,760 --> 02:30:57,600
looking forward they are not suffering

4238
02:30:56,559 --> 02:30:59,840
from a

4239
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:01,680
can you know perpetual condition of oh i

4240
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:02,639
have to satisfy these like you know

4241
02:31:01,680 --> 02:31:05,520
check boxes

4242
02:31:02,639 --> 02:31:06,799
to to do well right because you can lose

4243
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:07,760
yourself in that whole process for the

4244
02:31:06,799 --> 02:31:10,239
rest of your life

4245
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:12,079
but it's nice if it's possible like max

4246
02:31:10,239 --> 02:31:14,879
tegmark was exceptionally good at this

4247
02:31:12,079 --> 02:31:15,520
at mit figure out how you can spend a

4248
02:31:14,879 --> 02:31:18,559
small

4249
02:31:15,520 --> 02:31:20,880
part of your percent of your efforts

4250
02:31:18,559 --> 02:31:22,639
that such that your cv looks really

4251
02:31:20,879 --> 02:31:25,438
impressive

4252
02:31:22,639 --> 02:31:26,318
yeah absolutely there's no like without

4253
02:31:25,439 --> 02:31:28,318
a doubt

4254
02:31:26,318 --> 02:31:29,760
like that's that's a baseline that you

4255
02:31:28,318 --> 02:31:33,359
need to have

4256
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:34,880
um and then so like spend most of your

4257
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:35,760
time doing like amazing things you're

4258
02:31:34,879 --> 02:31:38,318
passionate about

4259
02:31:35,760 --> 02:31:40,000
but such that it uh uh kind of like

4260
02:31:38,318 --> 02:31:43,119
planet nine produces

4261
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:45,760
objects that uh that feed your cv

4262
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:47,200
uh like slowly over time so getting good

4263
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:48,719
grades in high school maybe doing

4264
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:51,600
extracurricular activities

4265
02:31:48,719 --> 02:31:53,358
or or in terms of like you know for

4266
02:31:51,600 --> 02:31:54,880
programmers that's producing code that

4267
02:31:53,359 --> 02:31:58,800
you can show up on github

4268
02:31:54,879 --> 02:32:00,799
like leaving traces like um

4269
02:31:58,799 --> 02:32:02,318
throughout your efforts such that your

4270
02:32:00,799 --> 02:32:02,719
cv looks impressive to the rest of the

4271
02:32:02,318 --> 02:32:05,439
world

4272
02:32:02,719 --> 02:32:07,119
in fact i mean this is somewhat along

4273
02:32:05,439 --> 02:32:10,000
the lines of what i'm talking about

4274
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:10,720
we see like getting like good grades is

4275
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:14,159
important but

4276
02:32:10,719 --> 02:32:17,438
grades are not a tangible like product

4277
02:32:14,159 --> 02:32:19,840
like you cannot out you know show your

4278
02:32:17,439 --> 02:32:21,200
a and and have your a live a separate

4279
02:32:19,840 --> 02:32:24,719
life from you

4280
02:32:21,200 --> 02:32:27,359
code very much does right um music

4281
02:32:24,719 --> 02:32:29,119
very much takes on you know provided

4282
02:32:27,359 --> 02:32:32,159
somebody else listens to it right

4283
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:32,800
right provide like takes on a life of

4284
02:32:32,159 --> 02:32:36,239
its own

4285
02:32:32,799 --> 02:32:40,478
that's kind of what i mean right doing

4286
02:32:36,239 --> 02:32:43,680
doing stuff that uh that can then

4287
02:32:40,478 --> 02:32:45,519
get separated from from you is is

4288
02:32:43,680 --> 02:32:47,120
exceptionally attractive right it's like

4289
02:32:45,520 --> 02:32:49,680
a it's like a fun

4290
02:32:47,120 --> 02:32:51,280
and uh and it's also very impressive to

4291
02:32:49,680 --> 02:32:53,280
others i think we're moving to a world

4292
02:32:51,280 --> 02:32:55,680
where grades mean less and less

4293
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:56,560
like certifications mean less and less

4294
02:32:55,680 --> 02:32:58,800
if you look at

4295
02:32:56,559 --> 02:32:59,680
especially again in the computing fields

4296
02:32:58,799 --> 02:33:03,358
getting a degree

4297
02:32:59,680 --> 02:33:04,880
finishing your um currently just getting

4298
02:33:03,359 --> 02:33:07,040
finishing your degree whether it's

4299
02:33:04,879 --> 02:33:08,719
bachelor's or master's a phd

4300
02:33:07,040 --> 02:33:10,399
is less important than the things you've

4301
02:33:08,719 --> 02:33:12,318
actually put out into the world

4302
02:33:10,398 --> 02:33:13,840
right right and that's a fascinating

4303
02:33:12,318 --> 02:33:17,279
kind of that's a that's great that

4304
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:19,760
in that sense the meritocracy is in its

4305
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:20,800
richest most beautiful form is is

4306
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:23,280
starting to win out

4307
02:33:20,799 --> 02:33:24,079
yeah it's weird because like you know my

4308
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:26,000
understanding

4309
02:33:24,079 --> 02:33:28,159
and i'm not like i don't know the

4310
02:33:26,000 --> 02:33:30,959
history of science well enough to

4311
02:33:28,159 --> 02:33:32,879
to speak very confidently about this but

4312
02:33:30,959 --> 02:33:36,318
you know the

4313
02:33:32,879 --> 02:33:39,519
advisor of my advisor of my advisor

4314
02:33:36,318 --> 02:33:41,600
from undergrad uh like didn't have a phd

4315
02:33:39,520 --> 02:33:43,359
right so i think it was a more common

4316
02:33:41,600 --> 02:33:46,840
thing back in the day

4317
02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:50,399
even in uh the academic

4318
02:33:46,840 --> 02:33:53,359
sector to you know

4319
02:33:50,398 --> 02:33:54,639
not have you know faraday like faraday

4320
02:33:53,359 --> 02:33:57,600
didn't know algebra

4321
02:33:54,639 --> 02:33:58,879
when drew diagrams about you know

4322
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:02,399
magnetic fields like

4323
02:33:58,879 --> 02:34:03,759
his faraday's law was derived entirely

4324
02:34:02,398 --> 02:34:07,119
from intuition

4325
02:34:03,760 --> 02:34:10,880
so uh it is interesting to to how

4326
02:34:07,120 --> 02:34:13,280
the world of academia has evolved into a

4327
02:34:10,879 --> 02:34:15,679
you got to do this and then get phd then

4328
02:34:13,280 --> 02:34:18,239
you have to post doc once and twice

4329
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:19,280
and maybe thrice and then like you you

4330
02:34:18,239 --> 02:34:21,600
move on so

4331
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:23,280
you know it does i do wonder you know if

4332
02:34:21,600 --> 02:34:25,760
we're

4333
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:26,800
you know if there's a better i think

4334
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:28,239
we're heading there

4335
02:34:26,799 --> 02:34:30,398
but it's a fascinating historical

4336
02:34:28,239 --> 02:34:32,478
perspective like that we might have just

4337
02:34:30,398 --> 02:34:34,239
tried this whole thing out uh for a

4338
02:34:32,478 --> 02:34:35,840
while where we put a lot more emphasis

4339
02:34:34,239 --> 02:34:38,079
on grades and certificates and

4340
02:34:35,840 --> 02:34:39,280
um degrees and all those kinds of things

4341
02:34:38,079 --> 02:34:42,879
i think the difference

4342
02:34:39,280 --> 02:34:46,000
historically is like we can actually

4343
02:34:42,879 --> 02:34:48,478
using the internet show off the

4344
02:34:46,000 --> 02:34:50,159
show off ourselves and our creations

4345
02:34:48,478 --> 02:34:52,799
better and better and more effectively

4346
02:34:50,159 --> 02:34:54,000
whether that's code or producing videos

4347
02:34:52,799 --> 02:34:54,639
or all those kinds of things that's

4348
02:34:54,000 --> 02:34:59,120
right

4349
02:34:54,639 --> 02:35:01,279
you can become a certified drone pilot

4350
02:34:59,120 --> 02:35:03,200
that's true of all the of all the things

4351
02:35:01,280 --> 02:35:04,720
you want to pick yeah for sure

4352
02:35:03,200 --> 02:35:06,079
or you could just fly make youtube

4353
02:35:04,719 --> 02:35:07,599
videos against hundreds of thousands of

4354
02:35:06,079 --> 02:35:10,079
views with your drone and

4355
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:11,680
never getting a certificate um that's

4356
02:35:10,079 --> 02:35:13,520
probably illegal don't do it

4357
02:35:11,680 --> 02:35:14,800
what do you think is uh the meaning of

4358
02:35:13,520 --> 02:35:18,079
this whole thing so

4359
02:35:14,799 --> 02:35:19,358
you look at planets they they seem to

4360
02:35:18,079 --> 02:35:22,478
orbit stuff

4361
02:35:19,359 --> 02:35:23,200
um without without asking the why

4362
02:35:22,478 --> 02:35:25,599
question and

4363
02:35:23,200 --> 02:35:27,680
for some reason life emerged on earth

4364
02:35:25,600 --> 02:35:30,318
such that it led to big brains that

4365
02:35:27,680 --> 02:35:33,359
can ask the big why question do you

4366
02:35:30,318 --> 02:35:36,559
think there's an answer to it

4367
02:35:33,359 --> 02:35:38,479
um i'm not sure what the question is

4368
02:35:36,559 --> 02:35:40,239
like what meaning of life the meaning of

4369
02:35:38,478 --> 02:35:43,760
life um

4370
02:35:40,239 --> 02:35:46,639
it's 42. it's 42. yeah but

4371
02:35:43,760 --> 02:35:47,280
you know aside from that it's um you

4372
02:35:46,639 --> 02:35:50,799
know

4373
02:35:47,280 --> 02:35:51,840
why i think if the question you're

4374
02:35:50,799 --> 02:35:55,279
asking is like

4375
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:59,760
why we do all this right

4376
02:35:55,280 --> 02:36:04,720
yeah um it's part of the human condition

4377
02:35:59,760 --> 02:36:08,880
right human beings are fundamentally

4378
02:36:04,719 --> 02:36:13,920
i feel like non like sort of stochastic

4379
02:36:08,879 --> 02:36:13,920
and fundamentally interested in in

4380
02:36:14,079 --> 02:36:17,120
kind of expanding our own understanding

4381
02:36:16,159 --> 02:36:20,398
of the world

4382
02:36:17,120 --> 02:36:21,439
around us and creating stuff to enable

4383
02:36:20,398 --> 02:36:22,959
that understanding

4384
02:36:21,439 --> 02:36:24,720
so we're like a stochastic

4385
02:36:22,959 --> 02:36:26,639
fundamentalist so like there's

4386
02:36:24,719 --> 02:36:27,920
just a bunch of randomness that really

4387
02:36:26,639 --> 02:36:28,959
doesn't seem like it has a good

4388
02:36:27,920 --> 02:36:31,600
explanation

4389
02:36:28,959 --> 02:36:33,199
and yet there's a kind of direction to

4390
02:36:31,600 --> 02:36:34,479
our being that we just keep wanting to

4391
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:36,720
create and to understand

4392
02:36:34,478 --> 02:36:39,199
that's right i've met people that are

4393
02:36:36,719 --> 02:36:42,478
you know that claim to be anti-science

4394
02:36:39,200 --> 02:36:44,720
right um and yet

4395
02:36:42,478 --> 02:36:45,599
in their anti-science you know

4396
02:36:44,719 --> 02:36:48,639
discussion

4397
02:36:45,600 --> 02:36:51,200
like well like if you're so

4398
02:36:48,639 --> 02:36:52,639
you know scientific then how why don't

4399
02:36:51,200 --> 02:36:54,960
you explain to me how

4400
02:36:52,639 --> 02:36:57,279
i don't know this works and like it

4401
02:36:54,959 --> 02:37:00,159
always there's that fundamental

4402
02:36:57,280 --> 02:37:01,040
speed of curiosity and interest that is

4403
02:37:00,159 --> 02:37:04,879
common to

4404
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:06,080
to all of us that is absolutely what

4405
02:37:04,879 --> 02:37:09,438
makes us

4406
02:37:06,079 --> 02:37:11,520
human right and and i

4407
02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:13,520
i'm in a privileged position of being

4408
02:37:11,520 --> 02:37:16,640
able to you know

4409
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:20,640
to have that be my my job

4410
02:37:16,639 --> 02:37:23,199
right i think as uh you know as time

4411
02:37:20,639 --> 02:37:23,680
evolves forward you know when the kind

4412
02:37:23,200 --> 02:37:26,479
of

4413
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:27,439
economy changes i mean we're already

4414
02:37:26,478 --> 02:37:30,159
starting to see

4415
02:37:27,439 --> 02:37:31,120
you know shift towards that type of you

4416
02:37:30,159 --> 02:37:34,879
know

4417
02:37:31,120 --> 02:37:36,800
creative uh you know enterprise as being

4418
02:37:34,879 --> 02:37:38,639
as emerging as taking over a bigger and

4419
02:37:36,799 --> 02:37:41,920
bigger chunk of the

4420
02:37:38,639 --> 02:37:45,039
sector it's not yet i think the dominant

4421
02:37:41,920 --> 02:37:46,159
uh portion of the economy by any account

4422
02:37:45,040 --> 02:37:49,680
but if we compare

4423
02:37:46,159 --> 02:37:52,318
this to like you know sometime when

4424
02:37:49,680 --> 02:37:52,720
the dominant thing you would do would be

4425
02:37:52,318 --> 02:37:55,760
to

4426
02:37:52,719 --> 02:37:56,959
you know go to a factory and do the same

4427
02:37:55,760 --> 02:37:59,280
exact thing

4428
02:37:56,959 --> 02:38:00,398
right i think you know there's a tide

4429
02:37:59,280 --> 02:38:02,000
there

4430
02:38:00,398 --> 02:38:03,840
and things are sort of headed in that

4431
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:05,680
direction yeah life's becoming more and

4432
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:07,520
more fun i can't wait

4433
02:38:05,680 --> 02:38:09,120
uh honestly what i can't wait to just

4434
02:38:07,520 --> 02:38:12,000
chill just just chill

4435
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:13,439
terminal point of this chill and wait

4436
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:14,559
for those kuiper belt objects to

4437
02:38:13,439 --> 02:38:17,359
complete one orbit

4438
02:38:14,559 --> 02:38:18,719
i'm gonna credit you with this idea uh i

4439
02:38:17,359 --> 02:38:22,079
do hope that

4440
02:38:18,719 --> 02:38:23,920
we definitively discover uh proof

4441
02:38:22,079 --> 02:38:25,840
that there is a planet nine out there in

4442
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:28,559
the next few years so you can sit back

4443
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:29,600
with a cigar a cigarette or vodka or

4444
02:38:28,559 --> 02:38:32,478
wine and

4445
02:38:29,600 --> 02:38:33,600
just uh say i told you so that's already

4446
02:38:32,478 --> 02:38:36,719
happening

4447
02:38:33,600 --> 02:38:37,680
i'm gonna do that later tonight as i

4448
02:38:36,719 --> 02:38:39,519
mentioned uh

4449
