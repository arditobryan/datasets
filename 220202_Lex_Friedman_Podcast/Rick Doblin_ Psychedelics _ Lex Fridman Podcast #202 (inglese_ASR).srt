00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:05,080
rick doblin founder

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,040
and executive director of the

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,638
multidisciplinary association for

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,599
psychedelic studies

6
00:00:08,638 --> 00:00:12,959
maps he is one of the seminal figures in

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,320
both the cultural history

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,240
and the cutting edge science of

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,320
psychedelics he was there

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,759
along with the biggest characters

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,719
throughout this fascinating history of

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,840
psychedelics

13
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,358
and he is here to tell the story quick

14
00:00:23,839 --> 00:00:29,039
mention of our sponsors

15
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,039
theragun expressvpn blinkist and

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,120
sleep check them out in the description

17
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,600
to support this podcast

18
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,759
as a side note let me say that exploring

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,520
the places the human mind can go

20
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,119
can help us understand where it comes

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,600
from how it works

22
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:45,038
and how to engineer mental journeys

23
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,760
whether that's through

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,679
life experiences chemical substances

25
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,039
brain computer interfaces or

26
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,840
interactions with artificial

27
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,239
intelligence systems on a personal level

28
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,199
i think the dissolution of the ego for

29
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,799
stretches of time

30
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,599
is a powerful tool for understanding

31
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:03,599
yourself a lot of things can do this

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,680
including jiu jitsu literature

33
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,560
meditation but psychedelics is

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,320
definitely

35
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,519
at least arguably one of the most

36
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:13,519
powerful from psilocybin to dmt

37
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:15,200
i'm excited that people like rick are

38
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,438
leading the scientific research

39
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,719
that reveals the efficacy and the safety

40
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:21,599
of these substances

41
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,359
so that their proper dosage and usage

42
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:25,599
protocols can be understood

43
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,200
and people like me can safely and

44
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,719
effectively use them

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,600
not just for recreation but for rigorous

46
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,719
exploration

47
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:35,438
of my own mind this is the lex friedman

48
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:38,840
podcast

49
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,639
and here is my conversation with rick

50
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,079
goblin could you give

51
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,118
an introduction to psychedelics like a

52
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:49,438
big bold whirlwind overview

53
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,519
what are psychedelics what are the kinds

54
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,919
of psychedelics out there

55
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:54,798
in whatever way you you think uh is

56
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,000
meaningful

57
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,680
all right well when i started maps the

58
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,118
multi-disciplinary association for

59
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
psychedelic studies it was very

60
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:04,000
important for me that psychedelic being

61
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
the name

62
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,520
and the way in which the original

63
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:12,318
meaning of psychedelic

64
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,520
it's mind manifesting it was created by

65
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,039
humphrey osmond

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,360
in dialogue with aldous huxley

67
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,318
and so psychedelic means mind

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,400
manifesting

69
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:27,839
and so we interpret that very broadly

70
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,360
to mean dreams or psychedelic anything

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,400
that kind of brings things to the

72
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,920
surface

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,000
holotropic breath work you know

74
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,000
hyperventilation is psychedelic

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,199
so most people think psychedelic is only

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,199
about certain kind of chemical

77
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,359
substances either natural

78
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,799
or synthetic but we've got a much

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,800
broader view of that

80
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,920
meditation can be psychedelic in some

81
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,319
ways but

82
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:48,958
our primary focus is on the drugs it's

83
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:52,000
on the

84
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,360
medicines or the you might call them

85
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,400
some people might call them

86
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,879
spiritual tools or sacraments

87
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,560
um there's sort of two general

88
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,239
categories of those

89
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,158
one are what are called the classic

90
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,319
psychedelics and those are the ego

91
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:10,000
dissolving

92
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:14,079
sort of merged into unitive states

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,439
those are like lsd psilocybin mescaline

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,760
ayahuasca ibogaine dmt

95
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:21,759
things like that and then there's mdma

96
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,719
which some people even argue is not a

97
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,639
psychedelic

98
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,639
they'll say it's an pathogen or an

99
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,839
intactogen it's about touching within or

100
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,839
empathy

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,080
it doesn't do the same kind of ego

102
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,439
dissolution

103
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,719
that the classic psychedelics do but it

104
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,878
brings material to the surface

105
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:43,519
and and it changes the way we process

106
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:43,518
information

107
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,560
and so i think you can quibble about

108
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:50,400
whether it's a

109
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,560
it's certainly not a classic psychedelic

110
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,760
but i think mdma is also a psychedelic

111
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,519
marijuana i would say it's a psychedelic

112
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:00,318
marijuana is closer to the classic

113
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,039
psychedelics than it is to mdma

114
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,759
one point i like to make is dreams

115
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:05,759
because

116
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:07,199
then everybody can relate to that dreams

117
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,318
are psychedelic dreams

118
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:14,079
bring emotions feelings um

119
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,919
ideas concepts in symbolic form a lot of

120
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
times or just in raw motions to the

121
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,039
surface so

122
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,239
when people hear the word psychedelic

123
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,960
often they

124
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,198
are frightened by it it's about loss of

125
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,758
control

126
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,040
and it is to an extent loss of conscious

127
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,000
control

128
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,240
particularly with the classic

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,439
psychedelics but you know and we know

130
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,800
with dreams that

131
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,719
we can have frightening dreams

132
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,918
nightmares but i think that

133
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
um anchoring the the concept of

134
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:42,799
psychedelic and dreams

135
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,280
is really helpful for people to know

136
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,120
that it's kind of a natural state

137
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,599
and that there are other ways that you

138
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,680
can catalyze it than by going to sleep

139
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,080
and that for thousands of years

140
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,519
substances have been used in that way

141
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:57,439
so you mentioned this idea of bringing

142
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,399
something to the surface which is really

143
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,519
interesting

144
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,959
so can you maybe elaborate the surface

145
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:05,359
and what is

146
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:06,399
there in the depths of things and how

147
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,680
does

148
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:11,839
ego dissolution fits into that

149
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,800
all right well aldous huxley talked

150
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:15,439
about uh

151
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,000
the brain as a reducing valve that we

152
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,759
have an enormous amount of information

153
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,839
so right now there's an air conditioning

154
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,919
sound in the background

155
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:25,439
but that's not crucial to what you and i

156
00:05:23,918 --> 00:05:26,959
are doing talking to each other so we

157
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,199
kind of tune that out

158
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:32,159
you know there's all sorts of sights and

159
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:36,080
sounds there's incoming information

160
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:40,000
in all the different sense modalities

161
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:44,159
and we have to figure out um

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:47,918
what's important to us and so the

163
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,960
mind in a way focuses a lot on

164
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:53,279
what are our core needs and and

165
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:55,198
we filter all the incoming information

166
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,439
that we get towards focusing on what our

167
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,680
court needs and we can even get to um

168
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,560
abraham maslow in the hierarchy of needs

169
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,959
about

170
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,600
survival needs belonging needs esteem

171
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:07,839
needs

172
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,840
go on so i think what

173
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:11,279
what i mean by bringing things to the

174
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:16,000
surface is

175
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:16,000
that we tend to

176
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:22,079
not focus on a lot of things that are

177
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:24,240
coming but we also push away things that

178
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:27,038
are difficult emotionally

179
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,639
difficult cognitively you know we all

180
00:06:27,038 --> 00:06:30,639
know that we're on this very short

181
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,960
trajectory from birth to death but we're

182
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,540
not

183
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:35,120
constantly thinking about dying

184
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:37,600
[Music]

185
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,399
although that can actually be helpful to

186
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,840
focus us

187
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:45,599
on what's really important traumas

188
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:45,599
are often suppressed

189
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,360
conflicts we see in america and around

190
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,360
the world the kind of rise of

191
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,360
irrationality

192
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,160
where people push away their logic in

193
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:01,839
order for their emotional

194
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,800
tribal needs to be met a lot of people

195
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,799
are

196
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,400
suffering from early childhood traumas

197
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,520
of a different kinds or abandonment

198
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,839
issues or

199
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:11,758
anything so we we tend to focus on just

200
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,159
you know what we need to survive

201
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,520
and what we need for work and esteem and

202
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,080
so psychedelics

203
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,120
by dissolving this ego control or by

204
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,240
with mdma

205
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,319
kind of strengthening our sense of self

206
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,680
and our sense of self acceptance we can

207
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,520
bring in um

208
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,319
other information that have previously

209
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,918
been too complicated or too painful

210
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,479
you don't think of psychedelics as

211
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:38,159
conjuring up something new

212
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:39,519
it is more revealing something that is

213
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,919
already there

214
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,639
i think that's a very crucial thing so

215
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:46,318
um

216
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,439
yes um um sasha shulgin

217
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,879
who um sort of the um godfather of

218
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,839
mdma you know he sort of rediscovered it

219
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,919
and

220
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,399
brought it um back into use he talked

221
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,120
about

222
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:02,638
his first experience was with mescaline

223
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,240
his first psychedelic experience was

224
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:06,160
with mescaline

225
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,240
and he had a tremendous experience but

226
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:11,439
what he said about it was

227
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,759
he was having a human experience that

228
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:15,839
the mescaline was helping him access

229
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,680
rather than he was having a mescaline

230
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,679
experience

231
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,120
so that it's not like you pop a pill and

232
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,478
you always have the same kind of

233
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,918
experience as everybody else

234
00:08:22,478 --> 00:08:25,598
the the experience is not contained in

235
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,279
the pill the pill

236
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,279
opens you up and you have an experience

237
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,878
of yourself

238
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,559
sometimes these are experiences that

239
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,360
we've never consciously had

240
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,639
but we can say right now that we know

241
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,800
that

242
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:40,319
our body below the level of our

243
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,478
conscious awareness has all these

244
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:46,720
self-healing mechanisms

245
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,639
and we we don't modulate them

246
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,399
to a large extent by conscious control i

247
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,000
mean eventually we we are learning more

248
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,679
about the mind body and we learn about

249
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,958
the placebo effect how what we think is

250
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:57,679
the case but

251
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,199
but i think that there's experiences

252
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,039
that are below our level

253
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,640
of conscious awareness particularly once

254
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,000
we're adults that

255
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,838
are more these unit of mystical

256
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,278
experiences sense of connection

257
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,200
you know i think kids are like this a

258
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,639
lot we kind of come from the void you

259
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,600
could say and you're born and you you

260
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,838
have

261
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,360
um a different way of processing

262
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,880
information what one

263
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,879
interesting point about that has to do

264
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:21,679
with ketamine which is

265
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,480
uh you know been approved s ketamine for

266
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,639
depression

267
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,680
but it's used for anesthesia and

268
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,799
roughly one-tenth the anesthetic dose

269
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:34,239
is a psychedelic dose and when it's used

270
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,759
in anesthesia

271
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,919
there's what's called the emergent

272
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:40,720
phenomena so this is you get

273
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,399
enough ketamine for um you can be

274
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,639
operated on you're not in pain you're

275
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,958
not really there your ego's knocked out

276
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:47,919
but you can still breathe but as the

277
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:50,639
operations

278
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:51,838
uh get over and then people metabolize

279
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:53,360
the ketamine

280
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,279
there's a process that they call the

281
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,720
emergent phenomena it's like as you're

282
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,600
emerging from this

283
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,040
tranquilized state and that's where you

284
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,240
pass through the psychedelic phase and

285
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,360
they don't prepare people

286
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,039
for that and

287
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,039
what we see is that a lot of adults have

288
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:11,278
difficult times with that

289
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,639
but children don't seem to have that

290
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:14,879
with those problems children are a

291
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,838
little bit more already in this kind of

292
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,320
state

293
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,440
and so ketamine is is used quite

294
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,720
frequently in children

295
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,560
now for anesthesia so

296
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,320
all of that is to say to your question

297
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:27,838
that um i think it

298
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,079
these psychedelics reveal things that

299
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,160
are within us

300
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,399
some things that are how we process

301
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,319
information back when we are children

302
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,759
um other things that we've never thought

303
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,360
of before that are sort of

304
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:46,078
baked into our consciousness um

305
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:49,839
you know there's one um drug 5-meo dmt

306
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:51,519
it's this toxin from a sonoran toad

307
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,920
that many people consider it to be the

308
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,078
most powerful of all the psychedelics

309
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,599
and it kind of knocks the ego structures

310
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:01,359
completely out of it

311
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,800
and we experience something different

312
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,959
but it's something i think that's always

313
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,639
within us it's at a deeper layer so we

314
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,239
knock out some of the higher cognitive

315
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,120
functions and then we experience things

316
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,320
in a different way

317
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,159
so my sense is that these are human

318
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,079
experiences that the psychedelics

319
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:17,919
bring us to yeah it's really profound

320
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:19,838
but and that's a dmt is a really

321
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,679
interesting example so

322
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,440
uh terence mckenna has talked about

323
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,719
these machine elves

324
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,959
right and there's this um i think

325
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,160
from the people i've heard speak about

326
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,159
the experience

327
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:33,679
there's a sense that you are traveling

328
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:36,958
elsewhere

329
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:38,078
to meet entities whether they're elves

330
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,359
or not

331
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,559
so in your sense you're not traveling

332
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,240
elsewhere

333
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,159
you're just revealing something that's

334
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,480
within and maybe it's a

335
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,159
a particular mechanism of revealing

336
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,079
what's already within

337
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,360
yeah and i knew terence i spent a lot of

338
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:57,199
time talking with terence

339
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,560
and i do not um ascribe to a lot of

340
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,160
things that he was saying he was

341
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,399
tremendous entertainer

342
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,480
and i think he did a lot of really good

343
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,240
things and focused us on

344
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,399
you know the power of psychedelics but i

345
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,079
think um i've never seen these quote

346
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:14,078
machine elves

347
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,919
i think culture is more determinative

348
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,120
of what people experience under

349
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,799
psychedelics

350
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,000
your preconceptions than um than we give

351
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:25,278
it credit for

352
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,440
and so i think there's a lot of um

353
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:28,879
priming that you could say that people

354
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,320
receive by

355
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:34,639
stories from their culture um

356
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,399
you know with ayahuasca it's about

357
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,879
jaguars and amazonian animals and so i i

358
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:45,440
think these machine elves are this uh

359
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:49,439
construct of terrans that other people

360
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:52,160
do see there's actually some people that

361
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,440
are very interested in doing a study and

362
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:56,639
they're they're

363
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,720
well-funded and moving toward it to

364
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,879
keep people on an iv infusion of dmt

365
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,839
for them specifically to see do they

366
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,000
contact

367
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,600
machine elves or aliens and what kind of

368
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,879
information do they bring back from

369
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:13,839
these other

370
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:13,838
cells other places or other entities

371
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,320
one question is you know who are we are

372
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,399
are we

373
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,680
connected to everything in the universe

374
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
we certainly know

375
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,759
in many cases you talk about waves or

376
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,159
particles you know

377
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,200
the quantum approach so i don't

378
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,278
interpret

379
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:36,399
um experiences that we have of some

380
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:38,720
entity that's you know somehow or other

381
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,759
deep in our consciousness that's

382
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,519
not us it's a part of who we are so i

383
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,039
tend to interpret it in that way

384
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:50,320
the the question is how big are we

385
00:13:47,039 --> 00:13:54,719
yeah i mean that that's uh and how many

386
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:56,160
ideas are within us that can be revealed

387
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,278
by changing the perspective you

388
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,958
mentioned physics one of the

389
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,240
what physicists mathematical physicists

390
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:08,239
or mathematicians do

391
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,600
is the they reveal truths by looking at

392
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,120
a

393
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,199
by taking a slightly different

394
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,639
perspective on a problem that reveals

395
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:17,919
the simplicity

396
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,639
of how it actually works in totally new

397
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:20,159
ways

398
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,039
that's what einstein did that's what

399
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:24,319
like every progress in physics

400
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:26,639
and certainly every progress of

401
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,639
mathematics requires you to

402
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,240
take a different perspective and then

403
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,039
perhaps that's exactly what

404
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,639
um psychedelics are doing it's not that

405
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,360
they're contacting

406
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,278
aliens that are elsewhere it may be

407
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,600
revealing the connection between us and

408
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,838
other

409
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,040
living life forms or actually might be

410
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,959
revealing

411
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:49,278
a totally new perspective on what life

412
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,958
is or what consciousness is

413
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:52,958
and giving us a glimpse at that even

414
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,599
though our cognitive capabilities are

415
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:56,000
limited

416
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,600
in to fully grasp and understand it so

417
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,320
it's just giving us an inkling of that

418
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,040
somehow

419
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,760
and it seems perhaps a little ridiculous

420
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,679
not

421
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,879
from a scientific perspective in the

422
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,719
sense that

423
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,559
we don't have a good physics of life or

424
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,320
physics of intelligence or

425
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:12,879
physics of consciousness but getting a

426
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,639
glimpse of that it's giving us a little

427
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:17,360
bit of um

428
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,560
maybe an intuition of uh which way to

429
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,159
head

430
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:24,000
to uh to build such a physics

431
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:27,759
yeah yeah i think so i think that

432
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,679
there's this um

433
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,039
other concept i guess i would like to

434
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:34,159
talk about briefly this

435
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,559
jungian collective unconscious this idea

436
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,120
that

437
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:39,039
somehow or other everything that has

438
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,039
ever happened

439
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:43,198
is still accessible maybe not with as

440
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:46,480
much

441
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,719
data or as much resolution

442
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,759
but that there's you know wave

443
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,320
resonances

444
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,560
so that i do believe that we can have

445
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:58,240
experiences as part of this human

446
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,679
collective unconscious

447
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,799
that we're not from our own life yeah

448
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,159
and that that we can it's like the

449
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,039
holographic realities

450
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,679
and that that that there is a way to

451
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,078
gather

452
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,239
information that can be accurate about

453
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,359
other times and places

454
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:19,919
um through depth

455
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,959
investigations of our own consciousness

456
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,838
but i think what

457
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:26,000
what i tend to believe is that it's

458
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,800
because there's emotional resonances

459
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,480
between where we're at now in this life

460
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,719
and

461
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:37,199
you know other kind of um

462
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,000
experiences that people have had before

463
00:16:37,198 --> 00:16:40,399
and you know

464
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
we always hear about uh everybody who

465
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:43,600
talks about past lives they're always

466
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,919
kings and queens

467
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,680
you know yeah so i think that's you know

468
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,719
that's again you filter things what you

469
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:51,039
want to be true

470
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,839
but but i do think that there is a way

471
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:57,039
to access information

472
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,959
beyond what we've taken in in our own

473
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,958
temporal existence through our own five

474
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,239
senses in some ways i really find that

475
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,000
compelling the notion that that

476
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,798
information is already there

477
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
and you're simply just moving the

478
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,639
attention of your mind

479
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,240
to different parts of that yeah i mean

480
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,759
we we have that with the radio

481
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,199
i mean you know you've got a frequency

482
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:18,798
you turn all this information

483
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,720
you could actually say right now between

484
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,160
the space between us we have the whole

485
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
world's knowledge that's up on the

486
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,360
internet

487
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,400
yeah it's right here yeah but we just

488
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,918
have to tune in

489
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,240
yeah what are the

490
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,440
interesting differences would you say

491
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,720
between

492
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,038
the various psychedelics that you

493
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,880
mentioned ayahuasca dmt

494
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:42,558
acid lsd marijuana mescaline pcp cell

495
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,760
cybin mdma all

496
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:45,119
you mentioned a few of them they're

497
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:46,960
really interesting we'll we'll talk

498
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,959
about scientifically some of the

499
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,720
the different studies that have been

500
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,319
conducted on each but sort of at the

501
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,079
high level

502
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:56,240
what are some interesting differences

503
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:57,839
well one of the big ones that people

504
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,919
make a big deal of that i think is

505
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,000
completely misplaced

506
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,080
is some are from nature some are from

507
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,919
the lab right so there's this kind of

508
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,759
like romantic thought that if it's from

509
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,559
nature it's good if it's from the lab

510
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:13,599
it's somehow tainted by humanity

511
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,480
and you know therefore some people are

512
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,759
like all for

513
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,120
plants psychedelics we see the policy

514
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,919
changes that have been happening in a

515
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:24,159
couple cities uh cambridge

516
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,919
somerville right not far from where

517
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,679
we're at now where they decriminalize

518
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:30,559
plant medicines so they call it

519
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:34,400
decriminalizing nature

520
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,399
so i i think that there is

521
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,080
from my perspective certain

522
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:43,440
certain things from nature or poison

523
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:46,159
certain things from the lab are

524
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,679
spiritual even if they don't show up in

525
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,919
nature like lsd

526
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,360
now there is something lsd is lysergic

527
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,640
acid diethylamide

528
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,399
there is lysergic acid amide lsa

529
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:59,200
which comes from morning glory seeds so

530
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,720
it's very similar

531
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,160
but at the same time i'd say i don't buy

532
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,319
into that distinction that there's some

533
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,759
fundamental preference

534
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:09,359
one of the things that terence mckenna

535
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,119
since we talked about him

536
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,399
he talked about how if it's from nature

537
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,558
it's good

538
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,919
and if it's not you know we should be

539
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,839
suspect

540
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,360
um of course he had a lot of great lsd

541
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,480
experiences but

542
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,719
actually terrance in 1984 we were at

543
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:28,798
eslin with a bunch of other people

544
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,880
this was before the crackdown on mdma

545
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:32,240
and this was some of the underground

546
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,320
therapists and the above-ground

547
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,640
researchers were trying to

548
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,558
talk about how to protect mdma from this

549
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,000
eventual crackdown and

550
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:41,599
terence was like forget about it you

551
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,880
know it's from the lab

552
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,399
you know it's dangerous we have

553
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,840
thousands of years of history all these

554
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,519
other things and you know what do we

555
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:49,359
know about mdma and

556
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,879
blah blah blah i was like terence you're

557
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:55,918
so um

558
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,919
um unscientific [ __ ] another

559
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,759
way to say it is and and i just said you

560
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,480
know we need a study

561
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,759
of uh the safety of mdma and so then

562
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,798
dick price who started

563
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:08,400
um aslan i said i'll put a thousand dick

564
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,158
prices he'd put a thousand so terence

565
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,440
was actually the catalyst for the first

566
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,679
study with mdma

567
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,679
wow um just because he was so

568
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,440
frustrating about how plants are okay

569
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:20,240
and you know if it's from the lab it's

570
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,240
bad yeah um so that's one distinction um

571
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:26,720
the the other distinction is this um

572
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,558
sense of uh classic psychedelics versus

573
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,600
things like mdma so to what extent do

574
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:31,918
they

575
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,959
uh dissolve the ego and you could say to

576
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,320
what extent do they

577
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,960
cause visions the 5-ht-2a serotonin

578
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:41,519
receptor subtype

579
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,880
which is responsible for a lot of that

580
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:44,879
where these drugs are activating

581
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,960
now masculine of all the psychedelics

582
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:54,480
chemically it's the most similar to mdma

583
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,360
it's a phenethylamine which is mdma so

584
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,159
in the 50s there was the 53 i think it

585
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:02,319
was the army chemical warfare service

586
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,240
wanted to look at drugs for

587
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,918
interrogations mind control

588
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,279
non-lethal incapacitance they did

589
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,600
a study in eight substances these were

590
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:15,519
now toxicity studies in animals

591
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,439
and on the one side was methamphetamine

592
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:18,639
and the other was mescaline and mdma was

593
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,840
in the middle

594
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,840
chemically so

595
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,119
mescaline of the psychedelics tends to

596
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,918
have the

597
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,519
warmth that mdma has it's not as

598
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,480
ego-dissolving quite as some of the

599
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:32,000
others

600
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,159
i mean it's the main active ingredient

601
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,480
in peyote it is very psychedelic very

602
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,480
visual

603
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,120
another distinction with these different

604
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:43,119
drugs is how long they last

605
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:45,038
and a lot of that has to do with the

606
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:49,038
route of administration

607
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:52,158
so for example if you smoke dmt

608
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,679
it takes 10-15 minutes and you're

609
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:59,520
within seconds you're off in another

610
00:21:53,679 --> 00:22:02,159
world um similarly 5-meo dmt very rapid

611
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,119
when you take dmt in the form of

612
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,679
ayahuasca

613
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:06,479
where it's mixed with another substance

614
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,559
that

615
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,279
makes it so that it's orally active then

616
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:14,720
it's a couple hours

617
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:17,519
so lsd is uh 8 10

618
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,480
12 hours sometimes psilocybin is more

619
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,918
like five or six

620
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,679
hours or four to six hours mdma is

621
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,080
similar

622
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:28,240
it's one reason why in our research we

623
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,079
give an initial dose of mdma and then

624
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,038
two hours later we give half the initial

625
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,199
amount

626
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:34,720
to extend the plateau because we want it

627
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,400
to last longer

628
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,159
for people to be in this therapeutic

629
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,480
state

630
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,240
so that's another distinction is um you

631
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,400
know how long these drugs last

632
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,359
another distinction is which of them

633
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,000
come from

634
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,279
a religious context they have a religion

635
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,679
built around them

636
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:53,678
we have this um sense that some people

637
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,440
are saying that 5-mo dmt

638
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,600
and the sonoran toad that they have this

639
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,440
long history of indigenous use but they

640
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:02,879
don't that's all modern it's made up

641
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:05,200
and it's kind of a new approach however

642
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,960
there was thousands of years of use of

643
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:09,279
psilocybin mushrooms in religious

644
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,480
contexts um

645
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:15,519
from um 1600

646
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,120
bc to 396 a.d the world's

647
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:19,038
longest mystery ceremonies the

648
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,719
elusionian mysteries

649
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,480
you know sort of the heart of greek

650
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,319
culture the heart of western culture

651
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,679
that was a psychedelic potion called

652
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,918
kikion

653
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,080
that seems like it's very much like an

654
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,759
lsd-like substance

655
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:36,879
um air got on grain and

656
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:39,519
you know lsd comes from aragon

657
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,039
so i think that there are a lot of ways

658
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:41,759
to look at these different substances

659
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:44,480
another

660
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:44,960
distinction is um you know which one of

661
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,200
them

662
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,000
are being researched right now in

663
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,519
scientific context and which are not

664
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,278
and because of the rise of all these

665
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:54,879
for-profit companies and everybody's

666
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,119
looking for what they can patent what

667
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,640
they can claim the land grab

668
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,918
you know more and more there are

669
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,320
companies looking at every different

670
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,400
kind of psychedelics

671
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:08,319
the ones that are most important that

672
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
are not being researched

673
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,038
mescaline but now there's a company to

674
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,839
do masculine a journey collab

675
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:17,038
ibogaine which is crucial for opiate

676
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,319
addiction

677
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,919
there's a new company a

678
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:23,599
branch of this company a thai that's

679
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,960
going to be looking at ibogaine

680
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:29,278
so i'd say the rise of the for-profit

681
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,798
companies is making it so that

682
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,480
there's just going to be an enormous

683
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:36,000
amount of investigations

684
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,798
into all these different psychedelics

685
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,798
but what we're going to see is the

686
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:42,079
development of new psychedelics that we

687
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,200
don't know anything about that have not

688
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:45,439
existed yet because

689
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,720
a lot of these for-profit companies are

690
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,200
going to want to

691
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,679
invent and patent and have composition

692
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,038
of matter patents on new molecules

693
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,200
so i think we'll see a lot of that

694
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:57,440
happening too that's really fast i mean

695
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,798
there's a lot of doors you've opened and

696
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,080
we're going to walk through all of them

697
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:05,278
including the research and so on but

698
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:07,199
on this one little tangent of um the

699
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,558
future of psychedelics so engineering

700
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,519
new psychedelics

701
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:13,119
can you comment on maybe the the

702
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,200
chemistry and the biology of how

703
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,798
psychedelics work and where is the space

704
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,400
of possible

705
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,679
engineering of psychedelics and what

706
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,200
kind of things might they unlock

707
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,480
in terms of the possible places our mind

708
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:32,400
would be able to go and the

709
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,480
the effects of that of improving health

710
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,679
but maybe at the basic level of

711
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,960
chemistry

712
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,880
and the space of what could be

713
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,440
engineered

714
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,720
well you you reminded me it's not i'll

715
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,840
get to exactly what you said but you

716
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,440
reminded me of

717
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:49,839
a talk i heard by buck mr fuller

718
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,798
shortly before he died and what he

719
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:55,278
talked about

720
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:58,240
is how technology was making things

721
00:25:55,278 --> 00:26:00,000
ever smaller you know that we are able

722
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,319
to pack more and more information into

723
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,480
smaller and smaller spaces

724
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:06,798
and that we're developing technologies

725
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,200
of communications with people you know

726
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,639
we now

727
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,440
know the internet and things like that

728
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,360
but what he said is that he thought the

729
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:17,720
eventual uh evolution of this sort of

730
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:21,759
research would move from this

731
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:24,558
miniaturization to telepathy

732
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,000
yeah and so it's like a shocking thing

733
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:27,359
for somebody like scientific like that

734
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,278
to say that yeah

735
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:32,558
um so will we unlock those parts

736
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,599
where i talked about the collective

737
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:39,200
unconscious will we be able to

738
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:42,000
more consciously explore those areas

739
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,120
so i think that that's a possibility

740
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
there was

741
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:47,678
stan groff who's you know the world's

742
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,679
leading lsd researcher

743
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:53,360
and has been my mentor his wife brigitta

744
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,000
they were talking about stories that

745
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:59,918
they had heard about um

746
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,640
mdma that um people take and then on top

747
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:05,520
of that they do 5-meo dmt

748
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,159
and so you get this ego dissolution but

749
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:09,200
underneath

750
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:12,559
that you have this sense of um ego

751
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:16,159
sort of um sense of self safety

752
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:17,599
of self acceptance kind of grounds it so

753
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,240
stan was like that's the future of

754
00:27:17,599 --> 00:27:22,158
psychiatry that you can

755
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,919
watch without the terror of the ego

756
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,600
dissolution the sense that you're losing

757
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,799
your mind or you're going crazy or

758
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:28,798
you're dying or

759
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:29,918
you know that you have this grounded

760
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:31,839
sense of safety

761
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,759
while you're dissolving your normal

762
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:36,158
sense of how you see things

763
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,679
and being able to engineer in in a

764
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,600
fine-tuned way that

765
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,840
that exact experience may be fine-tuned

766
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,158
to the person yeah as opposed to sort of

767
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:44,639
this

768
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,520
manual potion that's uh through through

769
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,360
uh

770
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,960
well i don't experiment although i don't

771
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:50,240
know about fine-tuning things to the

772
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,240
person in the sense that

773
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,079
um we believe there's this inner healer

774
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,038
this kind of you know inner healing

775
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,480
intelligence

776
00:27:55,038 --> 00:27:58,398
we talked about it the body repairs

777
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,159
itself you know so

778
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:04,719
um i think we more need to create

779
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,480
safety for people and then then what

780
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,079
emerges will be customized to what they

781
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,120
need to be looking at from this inner

782
00:28:08,079 --> 00:28:12,158
healing intelligence

783
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:15,359
at the same time we will move to uh

784
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:18,480
you know we we hear so much about um

785
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:21,359
the new approaches to oncology

786
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,200
where you know you you do um genetic

787
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:24,798
analysis of different kind of tumors and

788
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,480
then you have certain kind of

789
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:28,319
chemotherapy agents and you do like

790
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,360
personalized chemotherapy i think we

791
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:30,960
will have

792
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,359
more like personalized psychedelic

793
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,038
therapy but it'll be more like a

794
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,959
sequence of different drugs that people

795
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,599
go through over an extended period of

796
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,278
time and then you kind of customize

797
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,519
what's next and sometimes you'll combine

798
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:46,480
different drugs together like this

799
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,200
5mu dmt and mdma or a lot of times

800
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,159
people do

801
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,679
lsd mdma combinations or psilocybin mdma

802
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,880
combinations

803
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:59,120
um chemistry and um

804
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:01,520
it's not my strength i'm i'm more into

805
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,558
clinical applications and policy but but

806
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:04,158
i can say that

807
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,879
um from what i've learned from reading

808
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,120
from others and research done by others

809
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,919
that you know different psychedelics

810
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,398
have an

811
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:13,038
impact on different neurotransmitters

812
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,319
different other

813
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:19,440
parts of energies in the brain

814
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:22,480
the default mode network is

815
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,759
what's considered to be like our sense

816
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,360
of self

817
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,879
you know and it's this it's part of the

818
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:28,240
brain that's sort of is what i described

819
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,320
before scanning

820
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,359
the world and filtering information for

821
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,558
what's really

822
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:37,359
important to us and both

823
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:40,398
um focusing us on things and also

824
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:43,199
helping us to ignore a lot of things

825
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:45,839
and the classic psychedelics all weaken

826
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,360
the energy in this default mode system

827
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:48,798
and therefore you get this flood of

828
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,839
information that you're not normally

829
00:29:48,798 --> 00:29:52,000
paying attention to

830
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:54,558
and then you start seeing in more

831
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,278
creative ways or more connected

832
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,200
you actually move to beyond the verbal

833
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,480
kind of thinking into sort of

834
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,080
symbolic thinking a lot of times um

835
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,000
and that's where you sometimes get these

836
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,960
uh mystical sense of connection how it's

837
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,200
all one and

838
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,120
you get the sense also of

839
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,519
how big the universe is and how small

840
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:18,000
each one of us is

841
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,599
so there's a lot of work that sasha

842
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,759
shulkin and albert hoffman

843
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:23,119
who invented lsd and first synthesize

844
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,879
psilocybin and what they call structure

845
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,678
activity relationships

846
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,520
what is the structural molecule and then

847
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:31,360
how do you predict

848
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,200
what that new molecule that never

849
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,959
existed before is going to do

850
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,240
once you actually take it and

851
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,640
you can get close but you never really

852
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,440
know

853
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,880
until you actually take the drug and the

854
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,000
way that

855
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,960
sasha ran his experiments is that he

856
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,880
would take the drugs himself first

857
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,278
in low doses and he would sort of you

858
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,559
know step up the doses to have more

859
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:57,839
experiences if he thought it was

860
00:30:56,558 --> 00:30:59,678
valuable he'd share it with his wife

861
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,519
anne

862
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,440
but then what they would do is if they

863
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,519
both thought it was valuable they had a

864
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,278
group of 12 people that they were with

865
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,038
for many many years

866
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:10,720
and they would distribute these new drug

867
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:11,759
to these 12 people

868
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,480
and they would get the different

869
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,158
perspectives and he felt that 12 was

870
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,679
like a minimum number you know because

871
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,919
we're so unique how each of us see

872
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,600
things but then you kind of get a little

873
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,880
bit of a consensus on how a lot of

874
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,918
people are going to see it and then if

875
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,600
that

876
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,278
12 people were positive about it then

877
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:29,278
they would turn it over to leo zeff

878
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:30,480
who he called the secret chief the

879
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,000
leader of the underground psychedelic

880
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:35,440
therapy movement and then he would start

881
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:38,398
exploring it in therapy so

882
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,480
there's um still a lot of mysteries as

883
00:31:38,398 --> 00:31:40,959
far as structure activity relationships

884
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,319
and

885
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,000
it's not going to be the case that

886
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,759
people go into the lab and

887
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,720
they tinker with molecules and they know

888
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:51,759
exactly what they're going to get

889
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,278
and a lot of it has to do with the not

890
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,119
so much

891
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:57,038
chemistry as morphology you could say

892
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:57,359
the shape of the molecule and how does

893
00:31:57,038 --> 00:31:59,679
that

894
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:00,798
interact with receptor sites and so

895
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,919
we're getting better at

896
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,918
modeling all of that and how does that

897
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:08,159
interaction relate to the

898
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,480
the the morphing of the human experience

899
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:12,399
and deeply understanding that

900
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,319
perhaps there's no equations yet for

901
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:17,119
that kind of thing you really have to

902
00:32:14,319 --> 00:32:18,879
build up intuition by experiencing it

903
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:20,798
and over time and

904
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,159
sort of subjective self-report like

905
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:23,679
trying to build

906
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:26,000
an understanding of the effects of the

907
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,320
different chemistries yeah yeah you can

908
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,398
you can have approximate ideas but to

909
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:32,720
know exactly so

910
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,000
you know when i first tried mdma which

911
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,880
was 1982

912
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,359
and this was after i had done lots of

913
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:43,278
lsd and masculine

914
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:45,678
and mushrooms um i was shocked at how

915
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:46,558
different it was than these other

916
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:50,080
substances

917
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:52,798
and yet how profound it was so are there

918
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,720
whole new kind of categories of classes

919
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:56,480
of drugs that we're not aware of that

920
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,038
would be

921
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,839
not so much this like eco-dissolution or

922
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:05,759
emotional well what mdma does is uh

923
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:08,319
reduces activity in the amygdala

924
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:10,000
the fear processing part of the brain so

925
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,918
it's not just chemistry but it

926
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
it routes energy throughout the brain in

927
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,759
a different way it increases activity in

928
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,679
the prefrontal cortex

929
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:19,519
so you think more logically though that

930
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:22,880
i think has an enormous

931
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,519
impact on the effect of mdma the other

932
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,519
thing it does

933
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,440
is it increases connectivity between the

934
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,798
amygdala and the hippocampus so it helps

935
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,880
facilitate

936
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:32,158
um processing of things into long-term

937
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,880
memory

938
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:37,600
um and with ptsd trauma is like never in

939
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,600
the past it's always about to happen so

940
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,839
will we one time develop drugs that

941
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:44,158
would even be specific to

942
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:46,319
certain kind of memories we're working

943
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,080
with a woman rachel yehuda

944
00:33:46,319 --> 00:33:53,278
who is at the bronx va

945
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:55,678
and she's done some studies that are

946
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:57,200
with the epigenetics of trauma so she's

947
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,720
worked with holocaust survivors and

948
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,080
their children

949
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,640
and she has identified um

950
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,079
epigenetic mechanisms by which trauma is

951
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,360
passed from generation to the

952
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,480
generations

953
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:10,960
sort of like set points for anxiety fear

954
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,000
certain

955
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,000
things like that but the question is can

956
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,280
you actually transmit memories

957
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,519
from one generation to the next now

958
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,519
this is not um dna

959
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,960
changes which happen over a very long

960
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,440
period of time in the

961
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,398
evolutionary scale but within one

962
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,119
lifetime within

963
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,960
some experiences your epigenetics what

964
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,838
turns on the genes or turns off certain

965
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,480
genes that can

966
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,320
be impacted and that's what we know now

967
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,838
can be transmitted from generation to

968
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,519
generation

969
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,759
either by the father or the mother

970
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:48,878
through the sperm or the egg

971
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:50,000
so it's it's pretty um remarkable so

972
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:53,358
what what rachel's going to

973
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,599
try to do is mdma research for ptsd

974
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:57,679
and look at these epigenetic markers

975
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,039
before and after and see if they change

976
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:04,639
as a consequence of therapy so

977
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:07,039
will we develop one day certain kind of

978
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:09,598
chemicals that will be able to bring

979
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:12,800
certain kind of memories to the surface

980
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,760
um that's not inconceivable the

981
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,440
epigenetic

982
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,079
angle is fascinating that there will be

983
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,639
these epigenetic perturbations that lead

984
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,760
to

985
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:22,799
memories living from one generation to

986
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,400
the other

987
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,599
and then bringing those memories to the

988
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,599
surface and using

989
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:32,799
using that as signal to understand what

990
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,920
exactly the psychedelics bring

991
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,720
to the surface and not yeah yeah now the

992
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,480
other

993
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,000
portion of that though is culture i mean

994
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,639
culture is where we store all these

995
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,960
memories

996
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,159
and in the stories that we get passed

997
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,480
down

998
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,799
especially with a lot of shared you talk

999
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:51,838
about the holocaust or world war two

1000
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,680
where it is um

1001
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:55,279
it's deeply ingrained in the culture the

1002
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:57,039
impact of those events

1003
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,320
and sort of in aggregate the different

1004
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,279
perspectives on that

1005
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:03,039
particular event create a set of stories

1006
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,760
that you can plug into

1007
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,679
and then they kind of resonate with some

1008
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,560
aspect of you that creates a memory

1009
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:10,319
that's

1010
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:12,000
connected to like when i think about

1011
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,160
world war ii and the holocaust

1012
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,599
i think about my own family but in some

1013
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:17,598
sense

1014
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,880
it's also resonating with stories of

1015
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,359
many others

1016
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,920
so it's like somehow the two echo each

1017
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:23,838
other

1018
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,960
and i'm just providing my own little

1019
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,358
flavor on top

1020
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,199
the the meat of the stories are probably

1021
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:31,119
those that are shared with others

1022
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,719
it's plugging into the collective

1023
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,358
unconscious that that's

1024
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:36,159
um that's really fascinating really

1025
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,759
plugging into

1026
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:40,639
like precisely plugging into particular

1027
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,079
memories

1028
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:47,440
as a way to uh to to uh

1029
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,839
deal with trauma and ptsd that kind of

1030
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,079
thing

1031
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,838
yeah i'll just have that the most

1032
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,480
important dream of my life

1033
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:54,960
ever was of a holocaust survivor telling

1034
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,000
me

1035
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,240
that he was miraculously

1036
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,599
saved from death

1037
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,439
and he knew that he was saved for a

1038
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:07,039
particular purpose but he never knew

1039
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,519
what that purpose was so in the dream

1040
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,279
i'm seeing him on his deathbed and

1041
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,119
and then he shows me whatever happened

1042
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,280
to him during the holocaust

1043
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,039
you know and then um we're back in the

1044
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,640
room on his deathbed and he says well i

1045
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,519
know what my

1046
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,559
purpose was now and i'm like oh great

1047
00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:24,320
what was it he said let's

1048
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,078
tell you to be a psychedelic therapist

1049
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,119
and to study psychedelics and

1050
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,280
bring back psychedelic research and

1051
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,039
i thought to myself i've already decided

1052
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,880
to do this you can lay this on me

1053
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:36,159
i can say yes and then you can die in

1054
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,039
peace and then he died in front of my

1055
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:39,838
eyes

1056
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,159
in the dream so i think that that kind

1057
00:37:39,838 --> 00:37:43,599
of

1058
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:45,279
cultural um transmission that i got from

1059
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,519
when i was really young

1060
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,440
you know then manifested in this dream

1061
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,719
and that was this

1062
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:56,000
story about how people can be

1063
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:59,039
um incredibly vicious and can be

1064
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,519
very motivated by irrational factors and

1065
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:02,838
so

1066
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:04,960
i i just feel that this this kind of

1067
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:07,358
multi-generational transmission of the

1068
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,720
story of the irrational

1069
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:14,239
you know being a murderous factor

1070
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:17,679
and something i needed to respond to

1071
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:19,838
was deeply ingrained and i i would say

1072
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,440
my guess is you know more culturally

1073
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,880
than this epigenetic

1074
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,280
mechanism yes yeah but your sense is

1075
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,640
that

1076
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:32,960
whatever stimulated a certain

1077
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:35,440
part of human nature in uh world war ii

1078
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,679
especially not to germany but also in

1079
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,320
stalinist soviet union

1080
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,799
still is within us within all of us just

1081
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:46,880
like we were saying uh you know

1082
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:50,000
um we embody quite a lot of things

1083
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:53,119
yeah and one of those is whatever the

1084
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,320
the capacity of for evil

1085
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,800
i seems to be one of those things

1086
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,640
yeah there's a quote um from carl jung

1087
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,160
from just a few years that

1088
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:06,559
before he died what he says

1089
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,679
and i'll just paraphrase it is that we

1090
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,639
need to

1091
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,480
understand psychology we need to

1092
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:17,118
understand

1093
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,920
who man is that the greatest danger

1094
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,720
to us is man there are no other dangers

1095
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,240
really

1096
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:25,919
that impact our species and then he goes

1097
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:30,000
on to say that

1098
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:32,880
we are the source of all coming evil

1099
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,920
now this was 15 years or so after world

1100
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,920
war ii

1101
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,599
but yeah and and i'd say one of the most

1102
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,720
important psychedelic experiences of my

1103
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,680
life was a dmt

1104
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:42,959
experience also terence was there ralph

1105
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:46,559
metzner

1106
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,720
andy weil a few others and we are um

1107
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:53,838
sitting around ed eslin smoking dmt

1108
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,519
and under the influence of dmt which now

1109
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:56,559
this was the first time i've ever smoked

1110
00:39:55,519 --> 00:40:00,800
emt

1111
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:01,759
um i had this super rapid fraction of a

1112
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,920
second like

1113
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,880
dissolving of everything that i well

1114
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,039
first off i saw

1115
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,039
a horizontal line then i saw a vertical

1116
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,559
line then it turned into a color

1117
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,400
red than it was red then it turned into

1118
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,078
cubes then it turned into like an

1119
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:16,240
mc-escher kind of like

1120
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:18,640
i don't know you know didn't make

1121
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:22,239
logical sense and then i was gone

1122
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:24,239
and then it was just this period of

1123
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:26,078
five ten minutes of just feeling part of

1124
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,159
this um enormous

1125
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,920
wave of um billions of years of

1126
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,159
evolution how

1127
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,599
i had this sense that in my innermost

1128
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,399
sense of who i

1129
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,559
am uniquely individually this inner

1130
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,800
voice that's talking to me that i didn't

1131
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,920
develop english that that it's like a

1132
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,318
gift to me from

1133
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,039
millions of people that so that even in

1134
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:48,639
my most

1135
00:40:45,039 --> 00:40:50,318
innermost uh sense it's not just me

1136
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,559
it's it's the product of everything that

1137
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:55,440
came before me i'm part of this bigger

1138
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,119
system and then i just thought wow just

1139
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,400
how many billions of years does it take

1140
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,000
to reach this point

1141
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,680
self-awareness and all this and it was

1142
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,800
glorious beautiful and then i had this

1143
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,838
thought

1144
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:07,280
um and this is where this kind of um

1145
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,880
intellectual honesty i guess you could

1146
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,960
say i just thought well if i'm part of

1147
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,880
everything and everything's part of me

1148
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,720
then it's not just the good parts that

1149
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:17,599
hitler's part of me too

1150
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:18,239
yeah and that was just this shock like a

1151
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,559
stone

1152
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:21,439
sunk you know and i just was very moody

1153
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,719
for the whole

1154
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:27,358
next day but it was that acknowledgement

1155
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:29,598
that each of us carries these potentials

1156
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:30,880
and what we activate is what matters but

1157
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:34,000
what what our potential

1158
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,358
are is the whole full range of things

1159
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,960
i don't know if you can comment about

1160
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:41,598
the dmt trip itself and what it's like

1161
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,838
starting from the very basic geometric

1162
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:46,960
shapes and then launching

1163
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:49,358
yourself into the context of the

1164
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,838
enormity of space and time in the human

1165
00:41:49,358 --> 00:41:51,838
history

1166
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:56,800
is there anything else to be said about

1167
00:41:54,318 --> 00:42:00,159
that kind of um

1168
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,800
visually or physically

1169
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:03,358
or emotionally about that journey what

1170
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,519
is

1171
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,838
what it's like that brief journey that

1172
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,159
reveals so much

1173
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,519
well i was with a group of people the

1174
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:13,679
way we were doing it

1175
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:14,719
was um you know each of us would smoke

1176
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:16,719
dmt

1177
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,159
have 10 15 minutes experience while we

1178
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:19,679
closed our eyes and you know everybody

1179
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:21,759
else was just chatting and then the

1180
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,480
person who did the dmt would come back

1181
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,880
and tell their story what happened and

1182
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,079
and then

1183
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:27,838
we'd think about it for a bit and then

1184
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,960
pass the pipe to the next person and so

1185
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:31,440
this was like a whole

1186
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,559
evening you know and so even the

1187
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:34,079
starting to interrupt even the

1188
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:36,719
conversations themselves then

1189
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,318
is part of the experience exactly yes

1190
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:38,879
yes because it's also what you bring

1191
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:40,559
back

1192
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,960
right i mean i think that's particularly

1193
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,119
for therapy you know it's not so much

1194
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,920
about what the experience is

1195
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:50,160
but it's what you bring back and what do

1196
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,240
you integrate and then also

1197
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:54,639
um how do you learn how to do these

1198
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,239
things on your own without the drugs

1199
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:57,598
there is this way because we're saying

1200
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:58,239
it's it's sort of a core human

1201
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:01,119
experience

1202
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:03,118
the drug is the mediator but can we do

1203
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,358
this on our own and once you've seen it

1204
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,960
and felt it then you have a little bit

1205
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:09,119
better sense to

1206
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,720
recreate it on your own although you

1207
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,760
know i've had dreams where i've been

1208
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:14,480
doing lsd

1209
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,119
and tripping and it was just incredible

1210
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:17,920
it was

1211
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,680
i was tripping in my dreams but i had

1212
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:21,920
not taken lsd

1213
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,799
so there's this way in which we do that

1214
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:26,079
so i

1215
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,519
i would say that from the dmt experience

1216
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,200
the sense of safety that's what i was

1217
00:43:27,519 --> 00:43:30,639
trying to get at with this

1218
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:32,399
group of us and this group of friends

1219
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:33,358
trying to do this common exploration

1220
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,280
that

1221
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:36,719
if you have this sense of safety you're

1222
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,079
incredibly

1223
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:43,118
vulnerable because you are

1224
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,720
giving up your um awareness really of

1225
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,920
what's happening around you

1226
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:51,519
i think there's what we're finding

1227
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,800
is that in our psychedelic research

1228
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:56,559
for ptsd um

1229
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,480
and what we see with the vaccines that

1230
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:00,159
that even african americans are

1231
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:02,000
reluctant to

1232
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,679
volunteer for vaccines because they

1233
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,880
haven't had that sense of safety

1234
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:08,480
from the medical establishment

1235
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,400
they don't volunteer for psychedelic

1236
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,679
therapy even as much

1237
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,519
so the overlay has to be this sense of

1238
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:16,719
safety as you become vulnerable and

1239
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:19,759
looking inside you're

1240
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:22,078
you're not um i i was just actually

1241
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,000
told about how there's a lot of work

1242
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,200
being done inside prisons to teach

1243
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,639
mindfulness and you know so

1244
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:32,480
one of the um charlene who's my

1245
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:35,759
assistant is trying to do work on

1246
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:38,000
um helping people in prison with

1247
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:40,000
trauma potentially one day with mdma or

1248
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,920
meditation or mindfulness but

1249
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,440
one of the exercises was you know

1250
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,880
teaching people to okay

1251
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,119
here's how you deal with stress you know

1252
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:48,640
just close your eyes and deep breath and

1253
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:50,318
what charlene was saying is people don't

1254
00:44:48,639 --> 00:44:52,239
close their eyes in prison

1255
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:55,358
you know you don't feel safe to do that

1256
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:59,199
so um all that is just to say is that

1257
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:00,880
um the context is the most important

1258
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:05,039
factor so while i'll talk about

1259
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,680
the dmt experience the context was this

1260
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:09,279
supportive sense of safety that i could

1261
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,879
be completely vulnerable and

1262
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,839
out of any kind of um control women i

1263
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,720
think you know

1264
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:18,880
often or less safe in this way than men

1265
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:22,000
because of all the sexual assaults

1266
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:25,519
um but what it can do

1267
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,400
by taking the ego orientation

1268
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,838
um offline to some extent it opens you

1269
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,880
up to much more

1270
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:35,440
and and to make a bigger point of that

1271
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,000
um we could say that um it's very

1272
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,679
similar to the copernican revolution

1273
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,679
and you know people thought that the

1274
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,919
earth was the center of the universe

1275
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:45,199
and you know the the inquisition

1276
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,240
murdered people that

1277
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:49,838
questioned that father bruno burned at

1278
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:50,479
the stake actually one of the things he

1279
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:52,559
said

1280
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,679
i think that's worth all these years

1281
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,279
later

1282
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,279
saying is that when the inquisition

1283
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:03,118
sentenced him to burn at the stake for

1284
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,920
espousing this idea that the earth was

1285
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,519
not really the center of the universe he

1286
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:10,800
said to the inquisition

1287
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:15,199
he said your fear in sentencing me is

1288
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:18,000
greater than my fear in being sentenced

1289
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,759
that their world view was so rigid yeah

1290
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,559
that they had to wipe out anybody that

1291
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:23,599
would question

1292
00:46:20,559 --> 00:46:27,440
it and and so

1293
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,838
this idea of psychedelics displacing our

1294
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:32,400
ego as the center of the universe

1295
00:46:29,838 --> 00:46:34,318
and to realize that we are just rotating

1296
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,960
about on something much bigger

1297
00:46:34,318 --> 00:46:37,519
than our individual life you know our

1298
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,760
ego is

1299
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:41,280
is designed almost to protect this body

1300
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,640
while we're alive

1301
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,040
and you can understand all the good

1302
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:47,358
reasons why that is

1303
00:46:45,039 --> 00:46:48,559
but it also disconnects us from this

1304
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:50,880
bigger reality

1305
00:46:48,559 --> 00:46:52,559
and so the psychedelics dmt by knocking

1306
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,480
this sort of

1307
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:56,639
ego orientation or the default mode

1308
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,679
network offline

1309
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,480
you open up to the the bigger sweeps of

1310
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:02,480
history

1311
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,519
so in that place of safety and

1312
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,240
vulnerability

1313
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:08,159
in that fascinating group of people when

1314
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,639
their ego was dissolved in this way did

1315
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,559
they have

1316
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:12,480
similar experiences is there different

1317
00:47:10,559 --> 00:47:16,159
places that their minds went

1318
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:18,079
yeah so you know once i had this kind of

1319
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:18,559
shattering experience that hitler's part

1320
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:20,559
of me

1321
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,078
yes you know no one else in the group

1322
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,920
had that probably

1323
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,680
a lot of them have maybe had that before

1324
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,800
or they they realize that they're not

1325
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:29,838
just

1326
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,519
you know the good the white hat good

1327
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:33,119
people and that they're all good and

1328
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:34,960
they're you know we've got to fight

1329
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,318
against the bad people

1330
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,240
you know so no people will go in

1331
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:39,920
different places and not only that

1332
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:40,959
if you do it again you'll go into a

1333
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,480
different place than you went to the

1334
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,880
first time

1335
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:47,039
unless you have not resolved the issue

1336
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,280
so i had a sequence of lsd trips

1337
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:51,119
that were very difficult but it was like

1338
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:55,680
coming to the same

1339
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:57,519
sort of conundrum the same challenge

1340
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,118
that i was unable to overcome this idea

1341
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:01,599
of letting go and really fully

1342
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,599
dissolving

1343
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,960
letting the ego fully go and and i would

1344
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:06,880
have this sequence of trips over a

1345
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,400
couple months where i would reach this

1346
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,838
point where i was too scared to move

1347
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,160
forward and i would just be holding on

1348
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:15,440
so there are there are repeated themes

1349
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,358
sometimes

1350
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,039
what stan groff has said which i find

1351
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:22,000
very beautiful is that the

1352
00:48:19,039 --> 00:48:25,119
full expression of an emotion is the

1353
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,519
funeral pyre of that emotion

1354
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:28,480
and what that means is if you can fully

1355
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:31,838
let in

1356
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,480
something then the essence of of life

1357
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:34,318
has changed

1358
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,760
is that it moves on that everything's in

1359
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:37,519
motion

1360
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,880
and if you can fully experience it even

1361
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:40,480
if it's a sense that you're going to be

1362
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,519
trapped in eternity

1363
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,838
in this hellish state if you surrender

1364
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,599
to that that's the way out

1365
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:49,199
you know this full experience of

1366
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:52,559
something is this

1367
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:53,679
um funeral part of that emotion and so

1368
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,119
that

1369
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:56,719
runs against a lot of what modern

1370
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:58,400
psychiatry is doing too which is to

1371
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:01,199
suppress symptoms

1372
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,039
and to and to instead of supporting

1373
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:04,960
people to kind of explore these

1374
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,159
insecurities so that then they can

1375
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,599
contain them

1376
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:13,598
and then they can move on so yeah

1377
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:16,960
resistance is not a way to make progress

1378
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,359
right um although in

1379
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:22,079
one of the reasons why we do the

1380
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:25,519
supplemental dose during the mdma or why

1381
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:26,960
there's advantages in a 10 hour lsd

1382
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:28,800
experience is that

1383
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,960
you have a lot of opportunities to come

1384
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,960
up against this resistance

1385
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,800
it may be too difficult to deal with and

1386
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,480
then you kind of push it aside and then

1387
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:38,240
a couple hours later you come back to it

1388
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,358
or you come back to it press news every

1389
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:41,358
once in a while

1390
00:49:39,358 --> 00:49:43,440
if you're not ready it's hard to do that

1391
00:49:41,358 --> 00:49:46,318
i think the with mdma

1392
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,800
you can negotiate that's i think a part

1393
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:48,719
of

1394
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,720
its safety in a sense you can have this

1395
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:51,199
like oh i should be talking about this

1396
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:52,719
but i

1397
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:55,039
we're feeling this but it's too much for

1398
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:57,039
me now you can push it away but with the

1399
00:49:55,039 --> 00:49:58,960
classic psychedelics

1400
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:00,960
this kind of membrane between the

1401
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,760
conscious and the unconscious

1402
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,358
that um once you take the drug and it

1403
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,720
weakens this membrane and things are

1404
00:50:05,358 --> 00:50:10,000
coming up

1405
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:13,838
um it's very difficult to negotiate

1406
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:16,159
with it the the cl the key to successful

1407
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:18,078
uh classic psychedelic trips is

1408
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,000
surrender

1409
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,240
you've talked about that you first began

1410
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,318
to reconsider the negative

1411
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:25,679
health myths around psychedelics when

1412
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,000
you learned that the book

1413
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,679
one flew over the cuckoo's nest was

1414
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,440
written by ken gizzy when

1415
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:32,719
he was in part under the influence of

1416
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,760
lsd

1417
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,399
so how do you think lsd helped him ken

1418
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,520
keys in

1419
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,400
writing uh that incredible book

1420
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:44,960
yeah um there's a a process that's

1421
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,119
called semantic priming

1422
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:48,000
and so what what that means is that i i

1423
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:50,000
say um

1424
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,760
night you say day you know there's kind

1425
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,079
of normal patterns

1426
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,440
of kind of you say one word what kind of

1427
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,400
words come to you

1428
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,000
next and so they've done some research

1429
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:01,280
they meaning scientists have done some

1430
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,639
research

1431
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:07,359
where you give people a psychedelic

1432
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,239
and then you do this semantic priming

1433
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:10,358
and what you

1434
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:12,000
find is they have a wider range of

1435
00:51:10,358 --> 00:51:13,598
associations

1436
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,679
than they normally would when they're

1437
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,960
not under psychedelics

1438
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:22,159
so i think for ken kesey um

1439
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,760
he was able with psychedelics to get

1440
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:27,358
like um a deeper kind of emotional

1441
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:28,960
connection to some of these

1442
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,598
states of mind that people were in the

1443
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:34,880
instant this mental institution

1444
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:38,000
and that he could explore them more

1445
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,760
in-depth and more eloquently and and

1446
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,760
and also one of the things he talked

1447
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,280
about was the fog machine

1448
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,440
was you know how um people's minds were

1449
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,720
sort of clouded by the people that ran

1450
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,200
the institution and this

1451
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:52,000
the fog machine would be coming in so i

1452
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:56,399
think

1453
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:58,719
the um imagery and the metaphors

1454
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,880
that he used a lot in the book could

1455
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:04,159
come to him during lsd experiences

1456
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:07,119
and and then now he wasn't doing um

1457
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:09,440
you know very when you're writing you

1458
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:13,039
have to be

1459
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,318
literate uh you have to be able to write

1460
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:16,480
you know so it would be more like

1461
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:17,599
beginning and ends of lsd trips instead

1462
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,519
of at the peak

1463
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,640
but i think you would get a lot of these

1464
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:22,559
um

1465
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:25,279
the feeling tones or the images the

1466
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,599
metaphors i think he would get

1467
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,079
these extent also lsd lasts so long you

1468
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:33,359
can get these extended focus

1469
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,960
and you can really elaborate on um

1470
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:38,078
images and um so much of psychedelic

1471
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,960
experiences are

1472
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:42,160
poetic and metaphorical i mean you can

1473
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,000
take um

1474
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:49,118
you know veterans who've never um

1475
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:51,920
read a book of poetry in their lives

1476
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,318
you know and under the influence of mdma

1477
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,400
just

1478
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:56,480
what they describe the imagery and the

1479
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,400
way they describe their experience is

1480
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:03,838
metaphorical poetic it's incredible

1481
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:07,440
and so i think that ken kesey was

1482
00:53:03,838 --> 00:53:08,159
able to channel these what lsd did to

1483
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,599
his mind

1484
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,519
in a way that

1485
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:15,039
most people couldn't do that he did

1486
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:17,920
because he was trying to write this

1487
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:22,318
novel and because he was so brilliant

1488
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:25,440
yeah the i mean we'll talk about

1489
00:53:22,318 --> 00:53:27,759
psychedelics and treating

1490
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:29,200
in uh bringing some of trauma to the

1491
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,240
surface and dealing with all those kinds

1492
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,118
of things but

1493
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,799
there's something also to the opening up

1494
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,519
of creativity

1495
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,920
for whether it's for writing purposes or

1496
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:40,880
for

1497
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:43,358
for in my world for engineering for

1498
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:46,000
invention innovation and invention

1499
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:47,279
itself is a very it's a deeply creative

1500
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,800
process

1501
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:54,319
and it's fascinating to think

1502
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:57,200
with the aid of psychedelics what kind

1503
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:59,119
of ideas can be brought to life

1504
00:53:57,199 --> 00:54:00,799
yeah well we have the whole phenomena of

1505
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:02,720
a lot of the people in silicon valley

1506
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,839
and else microdosing psychedelics in

1507
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:05,598
order to

1508
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,519
have a little touch more of this

1509
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,400
creative approach to things

1510
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:12,400
i would love it to see if it was that's

1511
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,480
more like terence mckenna territory

1512
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,720
correct me if i'm wrong but i would love

1513
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:19,199
to serve more scientific to where

1514
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:20,799
there will be the rigor of saying how to

1515
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:23,358
do it effectively

1516
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,440
you know how to sort of understand sort

1517
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:29,039
of um

1518
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:29,039
not just almost um

1519
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:35,200
you know to take the full

1520
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,079
journey of creative exploration and to

1521
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:39,199
do it for

1522
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:42,400
prolonged periods of time you know um

1523
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:43,118
for years you know lifelong kind of part

1524
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,160
of your life

1525
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:49,680
of hot it empowers creativity i

1526
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:53,039
i think of course you start with

1527
00:54:49,679 --> 00:54:55,440
um helping people

1528
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,798
uh deal with trauma and then the next

1529
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:00,480
step is

1530
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:02,559
people who have moved past their trauma

1531
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,318
and are trying to do something create

1532
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:07,200
something special in their life

1533
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:07,599
how can then psychedelics empower that

1534
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,558
yeah

1535
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:12,240
now that also just to not shy away from

1536
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:15,200
anything controversial yes

1537
00:55:12,239 --> 00:55:17,118
um that has to that gets us to this um

1538
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,679
idea of psychedelics for vision quest

1539
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,318
particularly for younger people you know

1540
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:22,798
when you're

1541
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:24,480
sort of moving into this adulting kind

1542
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:27,440
of phase and you have to figure out what

1543
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:30,400
are you going to do with your life

1544
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,000
there's so many options a lot of people

1545
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,000
of course feel constrained that they

1546
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,960
have very few options but

1547
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,960
i think this idea of psychedelics as a

1548
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,440
way to help you

1549
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,159
find your calling or find your vision or

1550
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,838
find your unique leverage point

1551
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:48,318
i think we'll see that more and more as

1552
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:50,078
our culture evolves and gets healthier

1553
00:55:48,318 --> 00:55:51,920
around the use of psychedelics it says

1554
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:54,079
both the science

1555
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:55,920
uh having the rigor of understanding how

1556
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,640
to do it safely and the culture catching

1557
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,760
up

1558
00:55:56,639 --> 00:56:03,519
to the fact that this is uh both safe

1559
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:05,599
and uh like very useful

1560
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,199
yeah although i would question this idea

1561
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:10,079
of safety

1562
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:11,279
um so so we can understand physiological

1563
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:13,440
risks

1564
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,960
and we can minimize them and i think

1565
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:16,720
there's very minimal

1566
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,400
physiological risks from the classic

1567
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:23,759
psychedelics virtually none

1568
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:27,280
or for even mdma under safe conditions

1569
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:30,240
psychological risks are

1570
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:32,880
harder to address but we can do that

1571
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:36,399
through the sense of safety and support

1572
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:39,760
but i think there's um a level of risk

1573
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:42,079
there that we shouldn't overlook

1574
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,079
and so you know to make a drug into a

1575
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:46,400
medicine what we have to do is prove

1576
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:47,599
to the satisfaction of the fda and other

1577
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,880
regulatory agencies

1578
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,798
that things are safe and efficacious but

1579
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:55,760
even though they use those words proving

1580
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:58,000
safety and safe and efficacious

1581
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,920
it's in relationship to the disease that

1582
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,679
you're trying to treat and you accept a

1583
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,798
certain amount of risk

1584
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,440
so it's the risk benefit ratio rather

1585
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:10,239
than

1586
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:12,559
pure safety yeah absolutely

1587
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:14,639
let me ask you about kankeezy a little

1588
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,640
bit longer because the fascinating human

1589
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,679
being

1590
00:57:16,639 --> 00:57:20,159
he was also part of project mk ultra

1591
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,759
yeah

1592
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:27,598
yes what was project mk ultra and what

1593
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:31,920
uh lessons we should take away from it

1594
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:34,000
well mk ultra was a program

1595
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,680
by the caa you know what they were

1596
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,838
looking at was

1597
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:39,358
can you take these drugs these

1598
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,480
psychedelic drugs

1599
00:57:39,358 --> 00:57:45,358
and weaponize them in different ways

1600
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,400
um for interrogation for true serums for

1601
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:48,639
um

1602
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:50,639
you know exposing somebody before they

1603
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:51,279
give a big talk to something like lsd

1604
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:53,039
and then they

1605
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,400
you know can't talk or make a fool of

1606
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:57,279
themselves or

1607
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,798
can you spray lsd over the battlefield

1608
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,640
and have everybody tripping and drop

1609
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:00,880
their weapons and then you just walk up

1610
00:58:00,639 --> 00:58:03,440
and

1611
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:04,240
you know nobody dies and you've won you

1612
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,358
know the battle

1613
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:09,679
so so it's a fascinating concept yeah

1614
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:12,400
they call it non-lethal incapacitance

1615
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:13,118
and i think that's how uh one way to win

1616
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,160
a war is

1617
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,920
uh to enforce peace

1618
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,440
to get everybody not caring about the

1619
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:21,039
war but yes well i

1620
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,720
think gandhi said something even better

1621
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,400
which is that the true way to win a war

1622
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:24,879
is to turn your enemy into your friend

1623
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,440
yes

1624
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,920
that's a beautiful way to put it yeah um

1625
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,079
but

1626
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,680
mk ultra was really nefarious and it was

1627
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:33,200
part of our military and it was done in

1628
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:35,679
secret and um

1629
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:36,399
they would dose people against their

1630
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,399
will

1631
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:40,639
i mean one of the most infamous things

1632
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,639
uh

1633
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,720
was that they had a house of

1634
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:45,920
prostitution in san francisco and they

1635
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:47,759
would um

1636
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,599
have one-way mirrors all this stuff and

1637
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,799
then they would just dose people with

1638
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:52,079
lsd

1639
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,559
they would have the prostitutes dose

1640
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:55,760
these guys with lsd and and observe what

1641
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,720
they would do and how they would

1642
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,480
act and um the ca actually for a while

1643
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,798
was dosing each other

1644
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:04,349
secretly and that there's a famous case

1645
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:05,838
of this phil olsen that

1646
00:59:04,349 --> 00:59:07,759
[Music]

1647
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:09,679
either jumped out of a window or was

1648
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:13,359
pushed he might have been killed

1649
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:16,239
um he was a cia guy and they gave him

1650
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:17,759
lsd and then they're trying to see can

1651
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:18,639
they break him down and get him to tell

1652
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:20,319
secrets and

1653
00:59:18,639 --> 00:59:21,519
i think he felt uncomfortable with what

1654
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:23,519
happened to him while he's under the

1655
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:26,480
influence of lsd and

1656
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,239
um whether he was pushed or or not i

1657
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:31,260
don't know if we'll ever know

1658
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:32,879
but uh mk ultra was

1659
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:37,280
[Music]

1660
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:40,559
violating people's human rights it was

1661
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:44,000
done in secret and

1662
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:46,400
the irony of it is that ken kesey

1663
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,559
is one of the people one of the main

1664
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,240
early people that got lsd in this

1665
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:51,599
context and then

1666
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:53,679
he was one of the main people that

1667
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:54,640
helped inspire the hippies to use

1668
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:57,838
psychedelics to

1669
00:59:54,639 --> 01:00:01,358
oppose the vietnam war so

1670
00:59:57,838 --> 01:00:03,440
i think the cia kind of in many cases

1671
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:05,119
things get out of their control what

1672
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,610
they think they can do and it turned

1673
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:07,358
into be

1674
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:09,200
[Music]

1675
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:10,798
a disaster for them i think there was

1676
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,558
some thought that some of the people at

1677
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:14,000
the cia had this that if you can turn

1678
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:15,519
people inside

1679
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:16,798
you know take drugs and they just focus

1680
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:18,559
on their internal experience they're not

1681
01:00:16,798 --> 01:00:20,239
going to be involved politically

1682
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,680
it's a way to sort of take people

1683
01:00:20,239 --> 01:00:23,279
offline

1684
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:24,879
and what i don't think they counted on

1685
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,359
is that when you're offline and you have

1686
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:27,920
these

1687
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,838
unit of spiritual experiences and you

1688
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:30,880
realize how we're all connected then why

1689
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:33,679
do you want to

1690
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,200
go out and kill these vietnamese and put

1691
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,838
a

1692
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,919
one dictator over another dictator

1693
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:40,719
dictators on both sides in north vietnam

1694
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:44,079
and southeast

1695
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:48,078
why are we doing that so mk ultra has

1696
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:49,680
um just very disreputable

1697
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:52,160
uh we're learning more and more about

1698
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,919
what they did and one of the unintended

1699
01:00:52,159 --> 01:00:55,679
consequences was ken kesey

1700
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,960
and not only that but then the grateful

1701
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,759
dead who

1702
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:01,199
began at the acid test that gizi was

1703
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,880
helping to organize

1704
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:08,318
um and out of that emerged you could say

1705
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,079
just this incredible um psychedelic

1706
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:11,199
culture and you look at the bands that

1707
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,839
began

1708
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:15,519
in the 60s yes and which ones have

1709
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:18,719
really survived to the

1710
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:19,039
this day and um you know the grateful

1711
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,759
dead

1712
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:23,358
has survived longer than most any other

1713
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,119
band i mean some of them have died and

1714
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:26,000
all but but it was like the tightness

1715
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,680
the the sort of

1716
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:29,358
telepathy we talked about before that

1717
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,519
they could just

1718
01:01:29,358 --> 01:01:33,039
get so tuned in to each other and each

1719
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:34,719
other's energies and they could do

1720
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:35,759
improvisations and they could do this

1721
01:01:34,719 --> 01:01:38,318
incredible

1722
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:40,720
work that i think the the the

1723
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:44,239
sustainability of the grateful dead as a

1724
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:45,439
group was a testimony testament to the

1725
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:47,118
power of the lsd

1726
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:50,240
experiences and that might have never

1727
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:54,880
happened if not for mk ultra

1728
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:54,879
but uh can we talk about uh

1729
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:59,440
darkness a little bit so yeah yeah ted

1730
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,440
kaczynski the unabomber was allegedly

1731
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:04,400
part of the mk ultra studies

1732
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:05,039
while at harvard uh do you think this is

1733
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:06,639
true

1734
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,880
do you think it had an impact on him

1735
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,639
psychologically intellectually

1736
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,880
and so on i do think it's true and i do

1737
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:15,440
think i it had an impact so

1738
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:18,160
um we talked before about are these

1739
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,519
drugs somehow rather

1740
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:21,519
producing a certain kind of drug

1741
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,960
experience or do they bring out what's

1742
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:25,519
within

1743
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:27,199
so we have this experience yeah on the

1744
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:29,599
one hand ken kesey and he

1745
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:30,798
sort of took positive things out of this

1746
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,720
um on the other hand

1747
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:37,038
um you know we can um

1748
01:02:34,719 --> 01:02:39,358
get this uh opposition to the modern

1749
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:39,680
world to technology and to the point of

1750
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:42,239
uh

1751
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:43,279
creating bombs to try to go after it so

1752
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:45,519
that

1753
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,680
the experience is not in the drug it's

1754
01:02:45,519 --> 01:02:52,159
this interaction between

1755
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:55,838
the drug the person the context and so

1756
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:57,358
we can heal people with psychedelics or

1757
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:59,358
people can be driven crazy with

1758
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:02,639
psychedelics

1759
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:04,719
it depends again on the context and so

1760
01:03:02,639 --> 01:03:06,639
i think it's both these things can be

1761
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:07,279
true and i think it was really good that

1762
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,239
you kind of

1763
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:11,280
highlighted this that there is this um

1764
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:13,519
polarities

1765
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:14,319
and that it's not in the drug it's in

1766
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:16,400
the the

1767
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:18,400
other factors and it's who they were

1768
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,680
beforehand and then how you use that

1769
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,760
experience so

1770
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:23,358
all that's to say is if we put lsd in

1771
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,960
the water and everybody we're going to

1772
01:03:23,358 --> 01:03:25,920
get it it doesn't mean that all of a

1773
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:28,159
sudden everybody's going to have a

1774
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,000
mystical experience and then that's

1775
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:31,358
you know all we need to do and humanity

1776
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,280
is spiritualized or

1777
01:03:31,358 --> 01:03:34,480
end war and all of this it's it's not

1778
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:37,280
about

1779
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:38,400
the drug and that that actually is why

1780
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:41,440
for me

1781
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,760
um we've also talked about um

1782
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,798
engineering new psychedelics and all the

1783
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:46,400
people that are going to be trying

1784
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:47,920
for-profit companies to develop and

1785
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,400
patent new psychedelics

1786
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:53,760
for me the most important challenge is

1787
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:57,599
new cultural contexts

1788
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:59,520
that can create legality safety support

1789
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,798
for the existing psychedelics that we

1790
01:03:59,519 --> 01:04:03,838
already have

1791
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:06,239
i mean we have so much incredible

1792
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:06,880
tools in these existing psychedelics

1793
01:04:06,239 --> 01:04:08,959
that

1794
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,720
it's more about creating context for

1795
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:13,039
them to be used in

1796
01:04:10,719 --> 01:04:14,558
safe medical or personal growth or

1797
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:15,599
recreational even with harm reduction

1798
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:16,880
all these different ways that's more

1799
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:18,640
important to me than

1800
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:20,480
finding some new molecule that's

1801
01:04:18,639 --> 01:04:22,798
somewhat similar somewhat different

1802
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:24,400
but you know it can be patented so it's

1803
01:04:22,798 --> 01:04:27,759
the social context

1804
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:29,760
so i i do believe that ted kaczynski was

1805
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,839
part of nk ultra and i think it affected

1806
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:34,880
him in a negative way

1807
01:04:31,838 --> 01:04:38,400
and that's a cautionary tale that it's

1808
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:40,720
not in the drug it's in the context

1809
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,880
the context the person still it feels

1810
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:46,639
like um

1811
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:48,000
if viewed from a therapy perspective

1812
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:49,759
perhaps there was a way to use

1813
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:53,199
psychedelics to help

1814
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:53,839
ted kaczynski find a path out of the

1815
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:57,279
darkness

1816
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:59,920
i i think so and i think that um

1817
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,400
this is where i think mdma comes in in a

1818
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,119
way that

1819
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,160
mdma is um you know he felt very

1820
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,200
isolated

1821
01:05:04,159 --> 01:05:08,399
and very much out of society in some

1822
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:11,519
ways

1823
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,119
mdma stimulates oxytocin which we

1824
01:05:11,519 --> 01:05:14,798
haven't mentioned which is the hormone

1825
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,599
of nursing mothers of love and

1826
01:05:14,798 --> 01:05:17,679
connection

1827
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:19,920
it provides a lot of this sense of

1828
01:05:17,679 --> 01:05:22,318
self-acceptance and safety and and

1829
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:24,318
wanting to be in relationship there's

1830
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,519
google dolan is a neuroscientist at

1831
01:05:24,318 --> 01:05:28,639
hopkins she's given

1832
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:30,000
octopuses mdma they're solitary

1833
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:31,838
creatures

1834
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
except mating season which is not very

1835
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:34,558
often and but you give them mdma and

1836
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,679
they become

1837
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:38,079
more interested in hanging out with

1838
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:40,399
other octopuses so

1839
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,798
i think this um for people that have had

1840
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:45,440
difficult psychedelic experiences

1841
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:46,880
um mdma helps them integrate them we've

1842
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,119
worked with people that had

1843
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:50,160
a difficult lsd experience 40 years

1844
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,160
before

1845
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:53,598
and are still able to get back to that

1846
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:55,838
under the influence of mdma

1847
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:58,640
and work out some of the conflicts that

1848
01:05:55,838 --> 01:06:02,880
they weren't able to resolve

1849
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:04,798
all those decades before so i think that

1850
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:07,680
psychedelics could have been helpful in

1851
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:10,798
a different context for ted kazinski

1852
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:13,038
but the other big part of it is that

1853
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:14,719
people have to be willing to cooperate

1854
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,000
with the experience we talked about

1855
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:18,480
resistance

1856
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:20,239
so people can resist these things it's

1857
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:21,599
uh you know the saying is you can drink

1858
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:23,598
bring bring a horse to water but you

1859
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:24,079
can't make them drink yeah this is about

1860
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,000
how

1861
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:27,280
people have to be willing to go to these

1862
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:29,119
spaces so

1863
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,039
one of the essence of our therapeutic

1864
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:34,079
approach is that we

1865
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,280
help people to heal themselves that we

1866
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,680
are not

1867
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,680
giving them the healing it's it's a flip

1868
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:42,558
on the power dynamics

1869
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:44,239
that existed um you would say in the 50s

1870
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,440
and 60s my dad was a doctor and the

1871
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:47,038
doctors were gods

1872
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,280
and you know whatever they said was

1873
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,640
right and you know we no longer of

1874
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:53,839
course believe that but

1875
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,400
um for a while psychoanalysis with freud

1876
01:06:53,838 --> 01:06:56,480
you know

1877
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:57,599
that they gave the interpretation to the

1878
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,880
patient the patient couldn't help

1879
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,318
themselves but they would do the free

1880
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,160
associations and then

1881
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:03,920
psychoanalysts would see these conflicts

1882
01:07:02,159 --> 01:07:04,798
and would would be the one that does the

1883
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,720
healing

1884
01:07:04,798 --> 01:07:08,400
would give this interpretation and that

1885
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:10,639
would open things up so

1886
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:12,720
i i think it's this idea of empowering

1887
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:15,358
people to heal themselves

1888
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:18,239
and so if ted kazinsky had been in a

1889
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:21,519
therapeutic setting with psychedelics

1890
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:24,479
and if they'd had something like mdma

1891
01:07:21,519 --> 01:07:26,639
available or mda which was popular

1892
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:29,440
during the 60s which is a more like mdma

1893
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:31,598
lsd combination

1894
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,200
the outcomes might have been different

1895
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:35,599
let's take a step into the world of

1896
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:38,639
studies

1897
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:41,440
timothy leary who was he

1898
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:43,358
and what were the most important ideas

1899
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:46,480
you've learned from him

1900
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:47,598
well i did have the um

1901
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,280
opportunity to get to know him

1902
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:50,160
personally and to spend some time with

1903
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,350
him

1904
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:54,159
timothy leary

1905
01:07:52,349 --> 01:07:56,000
[Music]

1906
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:58,480
well let's start with nixon saying he's

1907
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,599
the most dangerous man in america

1908
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:03,599
that's a good place to start yeah yeah

1909
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:06,000
and and why did nixon say that it's

1910
01:08:03,599 --> 01:08:08,960
because of this uh

1911
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,389
tune in you know tur turn on tune in

1912
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,519
drop out

1913
01:08:10,389 --> 01:08:13,598
[Music]

1914
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:15,440
timothy leary was just an incredible

1915
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:18,719
advocate for

1916
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,920
um think for yourself question authority

1917
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:21,520
those were things he said all the time

1918
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,960
think for yourself question authority he

1919
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:25,520
was a rebel

1920
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,600
he was kicked out of west point um he

1921
01:08:25,520 --> 01:08:30,640
was a psychologist

1922
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:34,000
who um was at harvard for three years

1923
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:36,079
from 60 to 63.

1924
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,119
before he got to harvard he had an

1925
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:40,559
experience

1926
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:43,358
with mushrooms

1927
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,440
in mexico and that he said he learned

1928
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,279
more in that experience than he had in

1929
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,198
his entire academic career before then

1930
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:52,880
about how the human mind works

1931
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:56,318
and so he came to harvard wanting to do

1932
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,319
research into psychedelics

1933
01:08:56,479 --> 01:09:02,000
and he did some very important studies

1934
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:03,439
both of which well one was called the

1935
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,679
good friday experiment

1936
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:08,158
which was whether psychedelics in

1937
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:09,759
religiously inclined people taking

1938
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,119
psilocybin in a religious setting

1939
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,920
whether it could produce a mystical

1940
01:09:11,119 --> 01:09:13,838
experience

1941
01:09:11,920 --> 01:09:15,039
that took place at mars chapel at the

1942
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:18,000
boston university

1943
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:19,679
because it's a little bit subjective or

1944
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,000
you could say entirely subjective what

1945
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:23,759
people

1946
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,719
describe happens to them he wanted to do

1947
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,479
another study

1948
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:27,920
which would be a more objective measure

1949
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:29,358
and that was called the concord prison

1950
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,158
experiment and that was the thought if

1951
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,159
you can give people

1952
01:09:32,238 --> 01:09:36,399
psilocybin mystical sense of connection

1953
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:38,079
type experiences while they're in prison

1954
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:40,318
when they get out

1955
01:09:38,079 --> 01:09:42,798
they'll be more pro-social and they'll

1956
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:45,359
have reduced recidivism

1957
01:09:42,798 --> 01:09:47,119
um so tim did that he also did the

1958
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,400
naturalistic studies of giving loads of

1959
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:49,679
people psilocybin and

1960
01:09:48,399 --> 01:09:50,960
sort of writing down what their

1961
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:52,480
experiences were the range of

1962
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:56,640
experiences

1963
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:58,879
later on in his time at harvard he just

1964
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:02,159
they started doing lsd

1965
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:04,880
and lsd is more cerebral longer lasting

1966
01:10:02,158 --> 01:10:07,839
not as reassuring in a way as psilocybin

1967
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:10,640
sometimes he's to say that if they never

1968
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,440
got into lsd they'd still be at harvard

1969
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:16,000
with the psilocybin so he was a great

1970
01:10:13,439 --> 01:10:19,599
american psychologist but then

1971
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,238
he got tired of the psychology game

1972
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,360
you could say or he would say that he

1973
01:10:22,238 --> 01:10:26,399
got

1974
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:27,599
more and more interested in cultural

1975
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:30,559
change

1976
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,920
and various musicians and artists and

1977
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,400
all sorts of people started coming to

1978
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:34,239
him for

1979
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:36,079
the psychedelic experience that they are

1980
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:38,479
in a way for creativity for other things

1981
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:41,359
so he started hanging out with

1982
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:43,039
all sorts of famous people or you know

1983
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:46,399
creative people and

1984
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:50,319
um he stopped going to classes all

1985
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:54,799
a lot and um rom das richard alpert

1986
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:58,158
you know had um given lsd to a student

1987
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:00,159
that um romness was

1988
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:02,238
courageous enough to admit that he had

1989
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:03,519
the sexual interest in

1990
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:05,119
uh they weren't supposed to give it

1991
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,520
undergraduates that was about the only

1992
01:11:05,119 --> 01:11:09,198
time that they ever did it and

1993
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:11,600
psychedelics just getting more and more

1994
01:11:09,198 --> 01:11:13,359
controversial even in the early 60s

1995
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:14,719
eventually got kicked out of harvard and

1996
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:16,719
then he became

1997
01:11:14,719 --> 01:11:19,679
kind of a cultural icon for the

1998
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:23,679
counter-culture and

1999
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:25,279
was hounded by the police and nixon and

2000
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,000
spent a lot of time in jail i mean he's

2001
01:11:25,279 --> 01:11:29,920
an incredible

2002
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:34,800
person one thing that ramdas said

2003
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:38,158
is that richard albert ramdas said

2004
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:40,640
i'm a rascal but leary's a scoundrel

2005
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:42,879
what's the distinction um rascal's like

2006
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:46,560
in good fun a scoundrel is like

2007
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:50,000
you can't quite trust them i think um

2008
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:52,719
um idea yeah it's a spectrum of sorts

2009
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:54,079
yeah i think that leary was someone who

2010
01:11:52,719 --> 01:11:57,279
a little bit got addicted

2011
01:11:54,079 --> 01:12:00,559
to media attention yeah

2012
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:02,158
but i i think that um overall he gets

2013
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,640
blamed a lot for the

2014
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:06,238
backlash against the 60s the shutdown of

2015
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:09,360
psychedelic research i think that

2016
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:12,799
he is unfairly plain for a lot of that

2017
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:15,279
um i think when you look back at the 60s

2018
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:17,679
my son that the common narrative is that

2019
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:18,960
it was because psychedelic's going wrong

2020
01:12:17,679 --> 01:12:20,640
people took psychedelics they weren't

2021
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,640
prepared they had emotional breakdowns

2022
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:24,239
they went psychotic they

2023
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:25,920
killed themselves they did this or that

2024
01:12:24,238 --> 01:12:28,959
different problems of

2025
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:29,359
people taking psychedelics in um context

2026
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:31,840
that

2027
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:33,198
they didn't feel preferably safe in or

2028
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:34,480
or just they weren't prepared or they

2029
01:12:33,198 --> 01:12:35,678
didn't know how much they were taking or

2030
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:37,519
all this that so

2031
01:12:35,679 --> 01:12:39,440
the the backlash was because

2032
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,440
psychedelics gone wrong

2033
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:42,559
but i think the real reason well that

2034
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:44,319
did happen

2035
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:45,760
i think the real reason is psychedelic's

2036
01:12:44,319 --> 01:12:48,079
going right and

2037
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,039
people having this sense of connection

2038
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:50,800
and then

2039
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:52,560
the opposite of what the cia was hoping

2040
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,039
that it would kind of

2041
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:56,320
turn people inward and take them away

2042
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:59,519
from political struggles

2043
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:59,920
it actually motivated people once you

2044
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,080
actually

2045
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:04,880
um have these psychedelic experiences

2046
01:13:02,079 --> 01:13:08,319
your attitude towards death changes also

2047
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:10,159
this idea of death becoming an intrinsic

2048
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:13,599
part of life it's a natural cycle

2049
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:16,479
it's not so much so i think people

2050
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,400
realize that you know while there's this

2051
01:13:16,479 --> 01:13:20,319
billions of years of evolution

2052
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:22,079
you know infinity whatever that means in

2053
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:23,679
terms of time that we're here for a very

2054
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:25,119
limited time and they end up wanting to

2055
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:27,359
use their time well they have a

2056
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:29,679
lessened fear of death and they want to

2057
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,119
build this paradise on earth here now

2058
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:33,760
instead of later

2059
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,119
so a lot of people really did get

2060
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,199
motivated

2061
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:38,880
to challenge the vietnam war to work on

2062
01:13:37,198 --> 01:13:40,519
the environmental movement civil rights

2063
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:42,159
movement women's rights movement

2064
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:44,080
anti-militarism

2065
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:46,319
and it was that challenge to the status

2066
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:50,399
quo that caused the backlash

2067
01:13:46,319 --> 01:13:53,198
so leary is someone who um in 1990

2068
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:54,960
we had a now maps i started in 86 so in

2069
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:57,039
1990 we had this

2070
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,800
conference to raise money out in

2071
01:13:57,039 --> 01:14:00,399
california and leary was there and ram

2072
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:01,760
dust was there and ralph metzner was

2073
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:03,119
there and andy wilde was there and

2074
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:04,719
terence mckenna was there and dennis

2075
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:08,319
mckenna was there and all these

2076
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:10,719
but there was one point where um

2077
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:12,639
tim was speaking and afterwards i was

2078
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:14,000
asking him some questions and i said do

2079
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:16,480
you have any advice

2080
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,279
for us on how to work with the

2081
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:19,039
government and

2082
01:14:17,279 --> 01:14:20,639
and how to bring these psychedelics

2083
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:22,640
forward that's what we're trying to do

2084
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,159
i've got this non-profit for it you know

2085
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,600
we're trying to do this research what is

2086
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:27,359
your advice on

2087
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,199
how to bring this forward and how to

2088
01:14:27,359 --> 01:14:32,880
work with the government

2089
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:35,759
and he said [ __ ] the government

2090
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:36,640
he said i am so far past asking for

2091
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:39,520
permission for

2092
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,640
anything but i'm glad that you're doing

2093
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,480
it

2094
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,000
and then he held up my hand like you

2095
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,479
know like passing the torch

2096
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:48,079
wow so it was and that's one of my

2097
01:14:46,479 --> 01:14:49,279
favorite photographs of me and tim where

2098
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:50,880
he's sort of like but it was

2099
01:14:49,279 --> 01:14:52,719
after this [ __ ] the government i'm so

2100
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:53,679
far past asking for permission for

2101
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,840
anything but

2102
01:14:53,679 --> 01:14:57,679
yeah i'm glad that you are now i did

2103
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:59,760
follow-ups to the good friday experiment

2104
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:01,279
and i did follow-ups 25-year follow-up

2105
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:03,280
to the good friday experiment about a

2106
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:05,840
34-year follow-up to the concord prison

2107
01:15:03,279 --> 01:15:07,920
experiment

2108
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,920
what i discovered in some ways i would

2109
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,679
say is the key to the 60s what i just

2110
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:13,359
told you but in the the follow-up to the

2111
01:15:11,679 --> 01:15:13,920
good friday experiment that i did in the

2112
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:16,399
80s

2113
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,960
for my undergraduate uh thesis at new

2114
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:19,519
college

2115
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,960
in sarasota florida i eventually found

2116
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:23,040
19 out of the 20 people

2117
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:24,480
it was just that was an enormous

2118
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:25,198
challenge because their names were all

2119
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:27,039
lost and

2120
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:28,559
it just took forever years and years and

2121
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:30,479
years to find them all

2122
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,320
um but i discovered that those people

2123
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:33,678
that had the psilocybin experience in

2124
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,920
the midst of

2125
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:37,920
uh 25 years later with nancy reagan and

2126
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:38,239
ronald reagan and if there ever were

2127
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:40,560
there

2128
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:42,479
a social pressure to disavow the

2129
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,920
validity of the psychedelic experience

2130
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:47,039
that was then

2131
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:50,239
and instead they um affirmed it

2132
01:15:47,039 --> 01:15:51,920
that they thought with all of this years

2133
01:15:50,238 --> 01:15:53,119
of hindsight now looking back they

2134
01:15:51,920 --> 01:15:54,800
thought it was a valid mystical

2135
01:15:53,119 --> 01:15:59,119
experience

2136
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:02,320
but i discovered that one of the persons

2137
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:04,479
who had the psilocybin

2138
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:05,599
had this experience during the good

2139
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:08,559
friday service

2140
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:10,320
that um reverend howard thurman was the

2141
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:10,960
minister he was martin luther king's

2142
01:16:10,319 --> 01:16:12,319
mentor

2143
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:15,840
and reverend howard thurman was the

2144
01:16:12,319 --> 01:16:18,799
minister at boston merc at mars chapel

2145
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:20,400
uh martin luther king got his phd at

2146
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:23,119
boston university

2147
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:24,238
and howard thurman had spent time with

2148
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:26,319
gandhi

2149
01:16:24,238 --> 01:16:28,158
and so he was really kind of this hidden

2150
01:16:26,319 --> 01:16:28,719
person behind the civil rights movement

2151
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:31,359
about

2152
01:16:28,719 --> 01:16:32,880
non-violence as their strategy but he

2153
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:34,399
was interested in the the political

2154
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,600
implications of the mystical experience

2155
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:37,920
so he permitted this

2156
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:40,239
experiment to take place and there were

2157
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:41,600
20 divinity students from andover newton

2158
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:43,439
in the basement and

2159
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,440
10 experimenters all the people on

2160
01:16:43,439 --> 01:16:47,678
religion and psychology

2161
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,719
like houston smith and walters and clark

2162
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:51,600
and leary and rhonda

2163
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:52,480
mr others were there as a support part

2164
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,800
of it and

2165
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:55,759
the sermon was like three hours later we

2166
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,440
actually have

2167
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:59,280
three hours long we actually have the

2168
01:16:57,439 --> 01:17:00,960
original sermon from the good friday

2169
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:02,238
experiment from howard thurman up on our

2170
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:04,880
website

2171
01:17:02,238 --> 01:17:06,158
it's incredible but part of it was tell

2172
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,119
people there's a man on the cross

2173
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:09,759
and this one person sort of heard that

2174
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:12,238
and he thought

2175
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,679
okay i got to do that i got to the

2176
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:15,039
howard thurman was such a dynamic

2177
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:16,640
speaker he said i gotta tell people

2178
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:18,158
there's a man on the cross

2179
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,760
and so he said what am i doing here in

2180
01:17:18,158 --> 01:17:20,960
this basement chapel

2181
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,199
listening to the service i got to go

2182
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,000
tell people to manage correct so he went

2183
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:25,359
they thought he was just going to

2184
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,359
bathroom but he ran out the door he's

2185
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:30,559
running down commonwealth avenue

2186
01:17:27,359 --> 01:17:31,359
and houston smith and tim leary go after

2187
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:33,440
him

2188
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:35,039
and um he had thought that since he

2189
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:36,000
should tell somebody he should tell the

2190
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:39,039
president

2191
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:40,640
like why not but then he realized well

2192
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:42,640
the president's in washington i'm

2193
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,159
you know here in boston i'll just tell

2194
01:17:42,640 --> 01:17:46,000
the president of the university

2195
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:47,439
so anyway he's running down the street

2196
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,960
and and leary and

2197
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:50,158
houston smith go after him and he

2198
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:52,158
doesn't want to go back inside they

2199
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:55,119
finally get him he's not hit by a car

2200
01:17:52,158 --> 01:17:57,279
um but they end up giving him a shot of

2201
01:17:55,119 --> 01:17:59,679
thorzine

2202
01:17:57,279 --> 01:18:01,439
what's dorizine thorazine is like a

2203
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:04,000
major antipsychotic

2204
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:05,119
uh drug it's a tren it's it's a horrible

2205
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,679
drug

2206
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:08,559
uh but it knocks people out tranquilizes

2207
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:11,039
them

2208
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:13,280
we would never do that today um you know

2209
01:18:11,039 --> 01:18:13,920
we don't abort a difficult experience

2210
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:15,679
like that

2211
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,600
yeah but in any case they hid that that

2212
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:20,719
was not part of the

2213
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,120
um write-up of this experiment so

2214
01:18:20,719 --> 01:18:25,359
what they did is in a sense a little bit

2215
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:25,679
exaggerated the benefits it later became

2216
01:18:25,359 --> 01:18:27,279
out

2217
01:18:25,679 --> 01:18:28,960
three years later after the experiment

2218
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:30,559
or four years in time magazine it said

2219
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,239
everybody that got psilocybin had a

2220
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,920
mystical experience like

2221
01:18:32,238 --> 01:18:36,238
saying it wasn't true not everybody

2222
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:39,359
eight out of the ten did but not all ten

2223
01:18:36,238 --> 01:18:41,519
not this guy and they uh

2224
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:43,439
minimized the risks so there was a bit

2225
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,840
of that i think tim was reckless in that

2226
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:46,238
way

2227
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,880
it was underplayed the risks and over

2228
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:49,678
promised

2229
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:51,119
the benefits and then the concord prison

2230
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:54,719
experiment

2231
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:55,198
it turned out that um tim had fudged the

2232
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,960
data

2233
01:18:55,198 --> 01:18:58,559
completely and it wasn't really

2234
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,880
successful so

2235
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,239
i i fought him for that the outside

2236
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:05,199
world was doing the opposite

2237
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:07,519
it was exaggerating the risks and

2238
01:19:05,198 --> 01:19:09,599
blocking resources he felt justified

2239
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:10,960
to fudge the data yeah because the

2240
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:13,360
outside world was

2241
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,319
fudging in a sense the the response to

2242
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:17,920
the yeah

2243
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:21,679
yeah exactly yeah so so that

2244
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:23,679
that presents a very nice context um

2245
01:19:21,679 --> 01:19:26,158
[ __ ] the government but i'm i'm glad

2246
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:28,399
that somebody

2247
01:19:26,158 --> 01:19:31,519
is fighting the good fight from within

2248
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:35,279
and doing it the right way which is

2249
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:38,600
where you are so the 80s

2250
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:40,800
let me ask what is uh maps the

2251
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:42,640
multidisciplinary association for

2252
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:45,119
psychedelic studies and what

2253
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,320
what is its mission throughout the years

2254
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:49,198
throughout the decades

2255
01:19:46,319 --> 01:19:50,960
yeah so uh maps is a non-profit

2256
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:53,759
organization i created it as a

2257
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:57,439
non-profit pharmaceutical company

2258
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,719
i created an 86 after a dea the drug

2259
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,079
enforcement administration

2260
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:03,960
criminalized mdma in 1985 and that was

2261
01:20:02,079 --> 01:20:05,679
after they started trying to do that in

2262
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:08,239
1984

2263
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:09,600
and as i mentioned this uh terence

2264
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:11,919
mckenna is sponsoring you know

2265
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:14,079
motivating us to do this safety study

2266
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,440
so so we did that in preparation for

2267
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:18,079
this eventual crackdown

2268
01:20:15,439 --> 01:20:18,879
because mdma was called adam used as a

2269
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,119
therapy drug

2270
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:23,039
but it was also beginning to be sold as

2271
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,439
ecstasy as a party drug and that was

2272
01:20:23,039 --> 01:20:26,960
taking place in public settings and bars

2273
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:28,960
and so it was inevitable that the

2274
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:31,359
crackdown would happen

2275
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,000
and so i had a non-profit connected to

2276
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:35,039
buckminster

2277
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:37,600
fuller earth metabolic design lab

2278
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:39,519
that we use to support this lawsuit

2279
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,120
against the dea to block them from

2280
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,960
criminalizing mdma

2281
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:44,960
we were winning in the court of public

2282
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:47,039
opinion and winning in the court

2283
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,520
the dea freaked out and the emergency

2284
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:51,279
scheduled mdma in 85

2285
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:52,880
the handwriting was on the wall that

2286
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,399
they were not going to permit the

2287
01:20:52,880 --> 01:20:55,840
therapeutic use to continue because it

2288
01:20:54,399 --> 01:20:58,319
gets in the way of the narrative of the

2289
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:01,600
drug war and these are terrible drugs

2290
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:03,519
so in 86 is when i started maps as a

2291
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:06,719
non-profit pharma because the the

2292
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:09,760
strategy that i realized is that

2293
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:13,039
americans are open to medicines

2294
01:21:09,760 --> 01:21:15,039
you know that tools to ease suffering

2295
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:17,198
that was the opening wedge the opening

2296
01:21:15,039 --> 01:21:18,880
door to changing attitudes

2297
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:21,519
and it would be through science i would

2298
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:22,560
say that my religion is more science

2299
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:26,159
than anything else

2300
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:28,960
yes and you know culture and

2301
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:30,319
religion are metaphorical but often too

2302
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,639
much they become

2303
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:34,399
literal but but i felt that through

2304
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:36,480
science through medicine

2305
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:37,839
um there would be way to bring these

2306
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:41,119
drugs back to the surface

2307
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:42,159
and the mission was always this mass

2308
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:44,399
mental health

2309
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:46,559
this idea that what we need is to

2310
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:49,119
spiritualize humanity

2311
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:51,360
einstein said the splitting of the atom

2312
01:21:49,119 --> 01:21:52,079
has changed everything except our motive

2313
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:54,839
thinking

2314
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,079
and hence we drift towards unparalleled

2315
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:58,639
catastrophe

2316
01:21:56,079 --> 01:22:02,319
which shall be required if mankind is to

2317
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:06,000
survive is a whole new mode of thinking

2318
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:10,639
so what is that new mode of thinking

2319
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:12,399
i my presumption is that it's more of

2320
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:13,920
this mystical sense of thinking that

2321
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:15,359
that we're all connected

2322
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,039
and then if we realize that we're all

2323
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:18,238
connected we're not going to blow up the

2324
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,238
world so

2325
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:22,319
a lot of people say that you know if we

2326
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:23,198
could just give lsd all to world leaders

2327
01:22:22,319 --> 01:22:24,399
that would be

2328
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:26,000
you know then they'd have these

2329
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:27,599
spiritual experiences the world would be

2330
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,600
better but i actually had a ketamine

2331
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,039
experience the day after that dmt

2332
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:32,000
experience i described with the inner

2333
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:34,639
hitler

2334
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,399
this ketamine experience was um i was

2335
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:37,119
above and behind hitler as he was giving

2336
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:40,158
a speech

2337
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:41,359
like the nuremberg rallies kind of thing

2338
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:41,759
and i was trying to think how do i get

2339
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:44,238
into

2340
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:44,880
his head how do i undo what he wants to

2341
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:47,599
do

2342
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,199
how can we deal with him and and i

2343
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:51,199
realized this whole new thing about the

2344
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:53,198
heil hitler salute and

2345
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:54,799
you know he would like push energy out

2346
01:22:53,198 --> 01:22:56,719
and then everybody would do the salute

2347
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,480
back to him and so it's like the one to

2348
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:00,000
the many and the many to the one giving

2349
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:01,759
all these people giving away their power

2350
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:03,520
and then how it would just sort of

2351
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,880
ratchet up in intensity like these

2352
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,560
vibrations

2353
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:08,239
and and i realized there's no way to get

2354
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,360
into his head this idea we've talked

2355
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:10,079
about before about you have to be

2356
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:12,719
willing

2357
01:23:10,079 --> 01:23:13,679
yes right so what that sort of helped me

2358
01:23:12,719 --> 01:23:16,000
understand

2359
01:23:13,679 --> 01:23:17,760
is that the strategy has to be mass

2360
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:19,920
mental health it's not about changing a

2361
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:21,119
few liters we need to change the mass of

2362
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,359
humanity

2363
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:24,238
to this new mode of thinking this new

2364
01:23:23,359 --> 01:23:28,079
spiritual way

2365
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:28,638
so maps was a non-profit pharmaceutical

2366
01:23:28,079 --> 01:23:31,119
company

2367
01:23:28,639 --> 01:23:33,199
focused on psychedelics big pharma

2368
01:23:31,119 --> 01:23:35,119
wasn't doing this work government wasn't

2369
01:23:33,198 --> 01:23:36,479
funding it so the only source of funds i

2370
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:38,158
thought would be through nonprofit

2371
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:39,519
donations and that's been true up until

2372
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:40,638
just a couple years ago now that we have

2373
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:42,000
the rise of these

2374
01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:43,760
for-profits but that's because we've

2375
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,479
cleared out the regulatory

2376
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,520
obstacles we've got more scientific data

2377
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:49,359
about the benefits

2378
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,120
funded through philanthropy we've

2379
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:53,119
changed public opinion

2380
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:54,479
and there's a lot less zeal for the drug

2381
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:56,158
war so all of those

2382
01:23:54,479 --> 01:23:58,879
things have changed but at the time it

2383
01:23:56,158 --> 01:24:01,599
was mass mental health was the goal

2384
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,679
two tracks one was drug development the

2385
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:05,600
other was drug policy reform

2386
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,440
so that it's not just available to

2387
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:08,719
people who have a clinical diagnosis but

2388
01:24:07,439 --> 01:24:11,759
people who

2389
01:24:08,719 --> 01:24:14,000
are personal growth or you know

2390
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,960
they should have access to it as well i

2391
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:16,960
did not know

2392
01:24:14,960 --> 01:24:20,399
at the time that no drug had ever been

2393
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:23,039
made into a medicine by a non-profit

2394
01:24:20,399 --> 01:24:24,559
that was really good i didn't know that

2395
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:25,920
i might have been a little bit more

2396
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,760
daunted

2397
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,800
and actually that didn't happen for 13

2398
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:34,079
more years it happened in 1999

2399
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:35,760
and that was the abortion pill ru-46

2400
01:24:34,079 --> 01:24:37,840
that was approved in europe but

2401
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:39,280
controversial nobody no pharmaceutical

2402
01:24:37,840 --> 01:24:41,360
company would take it

2403
01:24:39,279 --> 01:24:42,960
and it was john d rockefeller iii

2404
01:24:41,359 --> 01:24:44,238
through the population council with the

2405
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:46,239
major donor being

2406
01:24:44,238 --> 01:24:47,599
warren buffett oh wow and the

2407
01:24:46,238 --> 01:24:48,959
rockefellers uh

2408
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:52,320
and the buffetts and some of the

2409
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:54,399
pritzkers were involved in funding this

2410
01:24:52,319 --> 01:24:55,759
so that was the first non-profit but but

2411
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:58,719
the the maps was

2412
01:24:55,760 --> 01:24:58,719
designed as

2413
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:03,920
from the very beginning not academic

2414
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,679
research into psychedelics but drug

2415
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,520
development and that's a fundamental

2416
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:09,119
distinction and that's why i think

2417
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:10,960
we're years ahead now with everybody

2418
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:12,639
else in terms of making

2419
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,639
a psychedelic assisted therapy into a

2420
01:25:12,639 --> 01:25:16,159
medicine because our goal

2421
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:18,400
from the very beginning was not

2422
01:25:16,158 --> 01:25:20,238
knowledge not academic research it was

2423
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:21,439
practical it was drug development how do

2424
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:23,279
we create new

2425
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:25,039
social structures how do we create legal

2426
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:28,399
access to these things

2427
01:25:25,039 --> 01:25:30,319
now in december of 2014

2428
01:25:28,399 --> 01:25:31,839
we created the maps public benefit

2429
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:35,359
corporation

2430
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:37,840
so maps is a non-profit but you know

2431
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:41,519
in our 35 years we've raised about 110

2432
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:43,760
million dollars in donations

2433
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,880
what i didn't know when i started maps

2434
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,199
and it took me

2435
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,480
um quite a few years i didn't even know

2436
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:52,960
this until about

2437
01:25:48,479 --> 01:25:54,959
eight nine years ago was that in 1984

2438
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:57,039
ronald reagan had signed a bill to

2439
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,719
create incentives for developing drugs

2440
01:25:57,039 --> 01:26:01,920
that were off patent

2441
01:25:58,719 --> 01:26:03,920
so mdma was invented by merck in 1912.

2442
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:06,239
it's in the public domain these

2443
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,760
incentives are called data exclusivity

2444
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:09,198
which means that if you make a drug into

2445
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,239
a medicine that does no patent

2446
01:26:09,198 --> 01:26:12,399
protection

2447
01:26:10,238 --> 01:26:13,359
nobody can use your data for a period of

2448
01:26:12,399 --> 01:26:15,119
time

2449
01:26:13,359 --> 01:26:16,399
to market a generic and that will

2450
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:18,319
effectively be

2451
01:26:16,399 --> 01:26:20,399
well it's five years you do pediatric

2452
01:26:18,319 --> 01:26:23,039
studies you get six months extension

2453
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:24,479
and and we are being required if we

2454
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:26,399
succeed in adults to work with

2455
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:28,319
adolescents with ptsd

2456
01:26:26,399 --> 01:26:30,079
it blocks a generic competitor from

2457
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:31,679
applying for for until that five and a

2458
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:32,559
half years is over takes fda at least

2459
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:34,319
six months

2460
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:37,440
to review so more or less six years of

2461
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:40,559
data exclusivity 10 years in europe

2462
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:42,238
is data exclusivity so the story then

2463
01:26:40,560 --> 01:26:43,920
became to the donors

2464
01:26:42,238 --> 01:26:46,479
that you're not going to have to give us

2465
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:50,000
money forever because we can make money

2466
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:51,678
selling mdma but we want to do

2467
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,039
two revolutionary things you could say

2468
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:54,719
one is psychedelic assisted

2469
01:26:53,039 --> 01:26:57,279
psychotherapy but the other is

2470
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:59,679
marketing drugs when you market it with

2471
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:01,679
the profit maximization motive

2472
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:03,440
we end up in the extreme getting the

2473
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:04,480
distortions that we have in america

2474
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:06,799
where we have the most

2475
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:08,718
expensive health care system in the

2476
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,159
world per capita but our outcomes are

2477
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,840
down like 40 or 50

2478
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:13,599
among the countries our average outcomes

2479
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,239
we don't have a third of the people or

2480
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:15,840
so don't

2481
01:27:14,238 --> 01:27:17,359
have insurance and it's just very

2482
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:20,639
inequitable

2483
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:22,238
so what we're trying to do is show a

2484
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,760
different way to market

2485
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:25,359
drugs and it's a modification of

2486
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:26,480
capitalism it's called the benefit

2487
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:28,319
corporation

2488
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:31,279
where you maximize public benefit not

2489
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:33,679
profit you still make a profit

2490
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:35,519
so selling mdma for a profit is not

2491
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:37,920
something we could keep inside

2492
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:39,440
the nonprofit because it's taxable it's

2493
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,359
it's a business

2494
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:42,638
so we've created the maps public benefit

2495
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:44,079
corporation

2496
01:27:42,639 --> 01:27:46,639
which is a hundred percent owned by the

2497
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:49,679
nonprofit so we have a non-profit that

2498
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:51,279
owns a pharma company and and the

2499
01:27:49,679 --> 01:27:54,079
mission of that former company

2500
01:27:51,279 --> 01:27:54,639
is to maximize not profit but maximize

2501
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:57,359
benefit

2502
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:59,039
for society yeah yeah although there

2503
01:27:57,359 --> 01:28:00,960
still will be profits and

2504
01:27:59,039 --> 01:28:02,800
the profits that we're going to make are

2505
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,480
going to be used towards

2506
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:06,079
the mission of maps which is again is

2507
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:08,559
this mass mental health and

2508
01:28:06,079 --> 01:28:10,559
ending the drug war and and in fact

2509
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:13,760
we've hired the boston consulting group

2510
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:16,400
to help us plot our commercialization

2511
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:17,440
strategy and so there is some

2512
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:18,879
suggestions

2513
01:28:17,439 --> 01:28:20,479
based there's so many different

2514
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,920
assumptions in this the number of

2515
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:24,399
therapists that we train

2516
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:26,480
the price that we set for the mdma

2517
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:27,359
whether insurance companies will cover

2518
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:30,079
it

2519
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:31,519
but there's the possibility of somewhere

2520
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:33,840
in the range of three-quarters of a

2521
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:37,199
billion dollars in profits

2522
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:39,920
during this period of data exclusivity

2523
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:40,638
just from the u.s you know and we're

2524
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,000
talking about the

2525
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:44,319
trying to do this research around the

2526
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:46,000
world as well so that's what the benefit

2527
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,439
corporation is the benefit corporation

2528
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:50,238
is our pharmaceutical arm

2529
01:28:47,439 --> 01:28:50,879
we're about 130 people now somewhere in

2530
01:28:50,238 --> 01:28:53,119
that

2531
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:55,279
fluctuates but one-third of them are in

2532
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:57,119
the nonprofit we do

2533
01:28:55,279 --> 01:28:58,399
harm reduction psychedelic harm

2534
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:01,599
reduction we help

2535
01:28:58,399 --> 01:29:02,960
you know create programs for

2536
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,760
people with difficult psychedelic

2537
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:07,520
experiences at burning man at festivals

2538
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,239
all over the world even in cities we're

2539
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,280
now

2540
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:12,238
negotiating with the um police the city

2541
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:14,079
of denver

2542
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:16,158
because denver has made the mushrooms

2543
01:29:14,079 --> 01:29:17,679
the lowest enforcement priority

2544
01:29:16,158 --> 01:29:19,839
you know we oregon has passed the oregon

2545
01:29:17,679 --> 01:29:20,639
psilocybin initiative so in those areas

2546
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:22,159
where

2547
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:23,760
maybe more people are going to gravitate

2548
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:26,479
to do psychedelics we want there to be

2549
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:28,079
harm reduction so that we don't have bad

2550
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:30,479
stories coming out that would change

2551
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:31,439
that so maps does the psychedelic harm

2552
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:33,119
reduction we do

2553
01:29:31,439 --> 01:29:34,719
public education we do a lot of it

2554
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:36,960
that's what you and i are doing right

2555
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:40,158
now we're doing that now

2556
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:42,079
so but and but also research towards

2557
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:43,679
well the research now is done in the

2558
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:45,519
benefit corp in the benefit

2559
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:47,199
yeah so so what happens is people donate

2560
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,880
to maps get a tax deduction

2561
01:29:47,198 --> 01:29:50,719
maps transfers the money or you could

2562
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,400
say invests in the benefit corp

2563
01:29:50,719 --> 01:29:53,920
yes the benefit corp will do the

2564
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:56,238
research and then

2565
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:58,079
maps is the sponsor but then we will

2566
01:29:56,238 --> 01:29:58,718
license the sale of mdma to the benefit

2567
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:00,559
corp so

2568
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:02,399
got it but but the research had done

2569
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,080
with an eye towards creating something

2570
01:30:02,399 --> 01:30:06,079
that has a big impact versus just

2571
01:30:04,079 --> 01:30:09,359
research for knowledge sake

2572
01:30:06,079 --> 01:30:12,238
yeah yeah because um

2573
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:13,119
i'm interested in political change um

2574
01:30:12,238 --> 01:30:16,079
you can

2575
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:17,279
the other part of it and which is that

2576
01:30:16,079 --> 01:30:19,359
the brain is the most

2577
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:20,960
uh complex thing we know in the in the

2578
01:30:19,359 --> 01:30:23,039
universe

2579
01:30:20,960 --> 01:30:24,800
it's gonna it's endless i mean when are

2580
01:30:23,039 --> 01:30:26,639
we gonna really like this idea of will

2581
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,960
we figure out telepathy will we figure

2582
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:28,880
out

2583
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,800
tapping into the collective unconscious

2584
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,000
what is the extents of our brain

2585
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,679
you know how does the brain actually

2586
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,560
work do you ask chemistry questions you

2587
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:36,480
know so

2588
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,400
if it's just the pursuit of knowledge

2589
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:40,158
that is an endless thing and how does

2590
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:41,679
that end the drug war how does that help

2591
01:30:40,158 --> 01:30:43,198
people directly so

2592
01:30:41,679 --> 01:30:45,199
that's why we're focused on drug

2593
01:30:43,198 --> 01:30:45,759
development more than mechanism of

2594
01:30:45,198 --> 01:30:48,799
action

2595
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:52,000
before i ask you about a one but

2596
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:54,719
several really exciting studies let me

2597
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,920
ask sort of a personal question for me

2598
01:30:54,719 --> 01:31:01,359
so if i wanted to get

2599
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:04,960
psychedelics from the maps

2600
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:08,799
public benefit corporation and uh

2601
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:09,760
explore my own mind um how do i get to

2602
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:12,320
do that

2603
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:14,320
uh and when you won't be able to you'll

2604
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:16,399
never be able this is very unfortunate

2605
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:18,399
because the the reason is because the

2606
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:20,158
benefit corp is designed as a

2607
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:23,198
pharmaceutical company

2608
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:24,638
so we can only work on clinical

2609
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:26,158
indication so let's say you

2610
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:28,719
you come to me and you just say oh i'm

2611
01:31:26,158 --> 01:31:31,198
really depressed can i get mdma to

2612
01:31:28,719 --> 01:31:32,639
overcome my depression or overcome my

2613
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:34,000
ptsd

2614
01:31:32,639 --> 01:31:35,679
you know we'll have to do research in

2615
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,760
those indications um

2616
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:39,440
and by when you say me you mean like a

2617
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,199
doctor so this would be prescribed in

2618
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:42,158
theory by doctors so this would go

2619
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:44,479
through a doctor

2620
01:31:42,158 --> 01:31:46,399
yes and a prescription okay let me uh

2621
01:31:44,479 --> 01:31:48,079
let me ask another question

2622
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:49,679
to further answer the so so that's where

2623
01:31:48,079 --> 01:31:52,079
the drug policy arm comes in

2624
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:53,359
the drug policy reform so you should be

2625
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:55,039
able to get

2626
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:57,679
access to psychedelics for your own

2627
01:31:55,039 --> 01:32:00,800
personal growth yes but that's not

2628
01:31:57,679 --> 01:32:03,359
medicine so that's why we need

2629
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,560
to medicalize to have things covered by

2630
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:06,479
insurance

2631
01:32:04,560 --> 01:32:08,239
to change people's attitudes the public

2632
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:11,039
attitudes and then

2633
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:11,678
we get this subsequent drug policy

2634
01:32:11,039 --> 01:32:13,198
reform

2635
01:32:11,679 --> 01:32:15,359
and and we're talking about it in terms

2636
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:17,119
of licensed legalization so my view is

2637
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:18,880
you should get a license to

2638
01:32:17,119 --> 01:32:20,479
do psychedelics you get a little

2639
01:32:18,880 --> 01:32:21,840
education stuff and then then you should

2640
01:32:20,479 --> 01:32:23,359
be able to buy it and do it on your own

2641
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:26,079
so let me rephrase the question

2642
01:32:23,359 --> 01:32:27,359
more specifically so when can i if i

2643
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:29,279
happen to have

2644
01:32:27,359 --> 01:32:31,039
um ailments of some kind where the

2645
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:31,920
doctor decides that psychedelics could

2646
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:34,800
help

2647
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:35,119
when would you be a loose estimate for

2648
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,960
you

2649
01:32:35,119 --> 01:32:38,960
of when a doctor would be able to

2650
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:42,079
prescribe to me something from

2651
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:44,079
uh maps public benefit co and then

2652
01:32:42,079 --> 01:32:46,000
when for my personal growth and

2653
01:32:44,079 --> 01:32:47,039
creativity would i be able to get

2654
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,479
something so like

2655
01:32:47,039 --> 01:32:50,479
just looking up this isn't like

2656
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:51,279
guaranteed but like your vision your

2657
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:54,959
hope

2658
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:55,920
yeah um for yeah for for academics in

2659
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:59,119
society

2660
01:32:55,920 --> 01:33:00,000
well the end of 2023 so two and a half

2661
01:32:59,119 --> 01:33:02,559
years from now

2662
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:05,920
we anticipate fda approval for the

2663
01:33:02,560 --> 01:33:09,039
prescription use of mdma for ptsd

2664
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:12,158
because the fda does not

2665
01:33:09,039 --> 01:33:14,639
regulate the practice of medicine there

2666
01:33:12,158 --> 01:33:16,238
is what's called off-label prescription

2667
01:33:14,639 --> 01:33:18,079
what that means the label is what it's

2668
01:33:16,238 --> 01:33:19,359
approved for so the label said this is

2669
01:33:18,079 --> 01:33:21,760
approved for ptsd

2670
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:23,759
and but let's say you come in anything

2671
01:33:21,760 --> 01:33:25,119
else social anxiety or whatever

2672
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:27,280
you can go to the doctor they can give

2673
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:28,559
it to you it might not be covered by

2674
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:30,479
insurance they have to be a little bit

2675
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:33,760
careful about malpractice if they're

2676
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:35,519
but i think the end of 2023 is when

2677
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:37,440
you will be able to do that now there's

2678
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:40,320
actually another program

2679
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:42,559
very limited called expanded access

2680
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:44,399
which is compassionate use

2681
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,600
which means that and we have approval

2682
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:47,519
for 50 people

2683
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,960
for compassionate use right now we think

2684
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:50,800
that'll grow

2685
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:52,480
so that's going to open up in about two

2686
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:54,079
months and so those are

2687
01:33:52,479 --> 01:33:55,678
people with ptsd they have to be

2688
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:56,800
treatment resistant nothing has worked

2689
01:33:55,679 --> 01:33:59,520
for them and they can

2690
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,639
access mdma while we're doing the phase

2691
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,040
three studies

2692
01:34:00,639 --> 01:34:04,239
wow and but they have to pay for it

2693
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:05,679
themselves we're not

2694
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:08,158
the sponsor has to pay for all the

2695
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:09,760
research but expanded access

2696
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:11,599
because there's no control group

2697
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:13,199
everybody gets the mdma

2698
01:34:11,600 --> 01:34:15,360
people can pay for it themselves and we

2699
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:17,119
think that'll start in a couple months

2700
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:18,719
but it's very limited it's limited to

2701
01:34:17,119 --> 01:34:20,479
certain cities there's also a program

2702
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:23,439
called right to try

2703
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:23,759
which is um passed through congress it's

2704
01:34:23,439 --> 01:34:25,678
it's

2705
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:27,199
it's similar this idea of compassionate

2706
01:34:25,679 --> 01:34:30,719
use but it cuts the

2707
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:32,079
fda out of it and patients can negotiate

2708
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:33,920
directly with

2709
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:35,519
pharma companies to get access to their

2710
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,079
drugs

2711
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,679
that's starting to happen i think in

2712
01:34:38,079 --> 01:34:41,279
canada now they're letting

2713
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,800
people have compassionate access to

2714
01:34:41,279 --> 01:34:44,719
psilocybin

2715
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,480
for life-threatening illness because

2716
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:47,920
there has been studies with psilocybin

2717
01:34:46,479 --> 01:34:49,678
for cancer patients and others with

2718
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:51,279
life-threatening illness

2719
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,359
as far as your question about when will

2720
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:56,719
you be able to access this

2721
01:34:53,359 --> 01:34:58,559
for personal growth outside of medicine

2722
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:00,158
i'll take that to mean you know fully

2723
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,000
legally where you can just go buy pure

2724
01:35:00,158 --> 01:35:03,920
drugs somewhere when will that happen

2725
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:06,639
you know we already are starting to see

2726
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:09,199
the decriminalization in certain areas

2727
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:12,079
of plants psychedelics

2728
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:13,439
and we see overall drug drug crim like

2729
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:16,000
that passed in oregon

2730
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:16,638
so that any drug is now it's not legal

2731
01:35:16,000 --> 01:35:19,840
you can't

2732
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:21,679
really fully set up clinics to

2733
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:23,199
offer it to people or there's no legal

2734
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:25,359
supply like that but

2735
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:27,599
it's decriminalized so my sense of

2736
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:29,039
things is based a lot on watching what

2737
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:30,719
happened with medical marijuana and

2738
01:35:29,039 --> 01:35:32,479
marijuana legalization so we're sitting

2739
01:35:30,719 --> 01:35:33,600
here in massachusetts where marijuana is

2740
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:35,198
legal

2741
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,880
but what happened first was medical

2742
01:35:35,198 --> 01:35:40,079
marijuana so

2743
01:35:36,880 --> 01:35:42,480
what we see is that medicalization

2744
01:35:40,079 --> 01:35:45,198
by demonstrating that under certain

2745
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:48,158
contexts the risks are

2746
01:35:45,198 --> 01:35:49,279
much less than the benefits and then

2747
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:51,118
there are benefits

2748
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:52,960
and then people hear stories about

2749
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:54,719
people that gotten better

2750
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:56,079
and then that changes their minds then

2751
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:57,600
eventually that builds up to

2752
01:35:56,079 --> 01:35:59,118
why are we throwing people in jail

2753
01:35:57,600 --> 01:36:01,119
shifts to culture yeah

2754
01:35:59,118 --> 01:36:02,559
yeah so i think that what we're going to

2755
01:36:01,118 --> 01:36:07,039
have 2023

2756
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:09,840
is mdma approved by the fda chances are

2757
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:11,039
psilocybin will be a year two after that

2758
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,039
then what we're going to need is a

2759
01:36:11,039 --> 01:36:15,039
decade of psychedelic clinics

2760
01:36:13,039 --> 01:36:16,158
that are going to roll out across

2761
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:18,399
america

2762
01:36:16,158 --> 01:36:20,000
also other countries as well thousands

2763
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:22,000
of these psychedelic clinics

2764
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,520
we already have hundreds of ketamine

2765
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:26,319
clinics

2766
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,760
that are ketamine for depression um more

2767
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:29,198
and more people are realizing that

2768
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,119
ketamine when it's used with therapy

2769
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:32,960
it's better than when it's not

2770
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:34,399
um but the therapists want to be

2771
01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,319
psychedelic therapists they don't want

2772
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:38,319
to be a ketamine therapist or an mdma

2773
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:40,000
therapist so those the cross-trained

2774
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:41,679
so we'll have a decade of these

2775
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,039
thousands of psychedelic clinics and all

2776
01:36:41,679 --> 01:36:44,800
these stories of people getting better

2777
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:46,560
in 2035

2778
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:48,400
is when i think that we will move to

2779
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:50,560
licensed legalization

2780
01:36:48,399 --> 01:36:53,039
which is when you will have the option

2781
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:55,360
of just going somewhere

2782
01:36:53,039 --> 01:36:56,079
once you've done this educational stuff

2783
01:36:55,359 --> 01:36:58,880
potentially

2784
01:36:56,079 --> 01:37:00,559
i also think it would be better to have

2785
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,760
the opportunity for people to go

2786
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:05,199
for free paid for by tax money to these

2787
01:37:03,760 --> 01:37:06,639
clinics and you have your first

2788
01:37:05,198 --> 01:37:08,000
experience with psychedelics under

2789
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:09,679
supervision

2790
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:11,760
and you know what you're getting into

2791
01:37:09,679 --> 01:37:13,440
you've you know

2792
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,560
to ask the questionnaire what the risks

2793
01:37:13,439 --> 01:37:15,678
are with the drugs then you get your

2794
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,920
license

2795
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:19,679
so 2035 is when i think that'll happen

2796
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,880
and the clinics will be sites of these

2797
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:23,199
initiations

2798
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:24,560
yes and so be a safe environment just

2799
01:37:23,198 --> 01:37:25,599
like you said all the things that are

2800
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:27,760
actually

2801
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:30,079
uh maximize the likelihood of a pleasant

2802
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:32,960
experience and all those kinds of things

2803
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:33,198
it is a frustratingly slow process and

2804
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,760
the

2805
01:37:33,198 --> 01:37:37,439
fda being part of that process is very

2806
01:37:35,760 --> 01:37:40,480
frustrating that

2807
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:42,960
of course there's there's benefits but

2808
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:43,919
uh boy well i wish you could move a lot

2809
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:45,760
faster

2810
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:49,679
yeah well one thing that i've learned

2811
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:52,719
from being a parent

2812
01:37:49,679 --> 01:37:55,279
is that when you have little kids it

2813
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:57,600
seems like they'll be with you forever

2814
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:59,359
but then when they grow up and they go

2815
01:37:57,600 --> 01:38:00,639
to college and they leave you look back

2816
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:03,679
and like where did that

2817
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:05,199
20 years ago you know so

2818
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:07,359
we're still dealing with the legacy of

2819
01:38:05,198 --> 01:38:10,638
the civil war and slavery in america

2820
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:11,519
yeah so actually a 20-year plan is not

2821
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:14,800
that long

2822
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:17,440
so while we say um

2823
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:19,360
it's frustratingly slow and it is you

2824
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:22,238
know i mean it's 50 years

2825
01:38:19,359 --> 01:38:23,118
since uh the psychedelic 60s and you

2826
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:26,959
know

2827
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:28,960
when right now it's um you know it's 36

2828
01:38:26,960 --> 01:38:30,399
years since mdma was criminalized

2829
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:32,480
and you think about all those people

2830
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:34,719
that committed suicide from ptsd

2831
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:36,799
or from anything else and all those

2832
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:39,359
people that could have been helped

2833
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,960
if the dea had accepted the

2834
01:38:39,359 --> 01:38:41,920
administrative law judge recommendation

2835
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:43,679
that mdma

2836
01:38:41,920 --> 01:38:45,279
stay in schedule three it's it's

2837
01:38:43,679 --> 01:38:48,399
tremendously sad

2838
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:49,840
at the same time culture evolves slowly

2839
01:38:48,399 --> 01:38:51,039
you know you read the bible or you read

2840
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,199
all the stuff we're not that different

2841
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:56,238
from people thousands of years ago

2842
01:38:53,198 --> 01:38:58,479
so how are we going to really evolve

2843
01:38:56,238 --> 01:39:00,000
enough over the next couple decades so

2844
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:01,359
we don't destroy the planet and don't

2845
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:03,920
kill each other

2846
01:39:01,359 --> 01:39:05,118
that's why i think psychedelics have an

2847
01:39:03,920 --> 01:39:06,480
important role to play

2848
01:39:05,118 --> 01:39:09,039
that's why i've devoted my life to

2849
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:09,599
psychedelics and it is frustratingly

2850
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:12,960
slow

2851
01:39:09,600 --> 01:39:15,520
and what i said to myself is our whole

2852
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:18,560
effort has not been fast enough can we

2853
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:21,920
talk a little bit about ptsd and mdma

2854
01:39:18,560 --> 01:39:25,039
there's this fascinating uh paper

2855
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:26,399
came out on a fascinating study that

2856
01:39:25,039 --> 01:39:28,319
you're a part of

2857
01:39:26,399 --> 01:39:29,679
that's a phase three study can you

2858
01:39:28,319 --> 01:39:31,679
describe what the study is can you

2859
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:34,719
describe what phase three means

2860
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:36,000
can you describe um what the findings

2861
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:39,118
are and why it's

2862
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:41,198
in fact so important and impactful yeah

2863
01:39:39,118 --> 01:39:41,759
this study came out may 10th in nature

2864
01:39:41,198 --> 01:39:43,839
medicine

2865
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:46,159
so one of the highest impact factors in

2866
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:48,960
medicine journals it was tremendous

2867
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:50,238
so to make a drug into a medicine the

2868
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:53,198
first thing you need to do

2869
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:54,718
is what are called non-clinical or

2870
01:39:53,198 --> 01:39:57,439
pre-clinical studies meaning

2871
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:58,319
safety established in animals what does

2872
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:00,000
the drug do

2873
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:01,519
what are the side effects in animals

2874
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:04,000
where do you see the risks and

2875
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:05,520
then you negotiate with fda to do phase

2876
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,359
one studies

2877
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:09,199
and phase one studies where you move

2878
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:12,319
from animals to humans

2879
01:40:09,198 --> 01:40:14,559
and those are more safety studies and

2880
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:15,599
trying to describe what the drug does so

2881
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:17,520
that you can

2882
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,199
determine if there is potential medical

2883
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:22,719
value there

2884
01:40:19,198 --> 01:40:25,759
certain drugs like cancer drugs

2885
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:29,039
are so toxic

2886
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:30,560
that um you don't have phase one studies

2887
01:40:29,039 --> 01:40:33,279
in healthy volunteers

2888
01:40:30,560 --> 01:40:35,199
it's like phase one slash two where it's

2889
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:36,719
you you bring in the patients

2890
01:40:35,198 --> 01:40:38,719
but you still are doing sort of dose

2891
01:40:36,719 --> 01:40:40,880
response safety studies

2892
01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:43,039
but you use patients but most phase 1

2893
01:40:40,880 --> 01:40:45,359
studies are healthy volunteers

2894
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:46,800
phase 2 are where you start bringing in

2895
01:40:45,359 --> 01:40:49,198
the patients

2896
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,000
and you start experimenting with various

2897
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:52,158
different things the

2898
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,520
purpose of phase two is really just to

2899
01:40:52,158 --> 01:40:56,399
design phase three

2900
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:58,159
now again i'm sort of putting out of the

2901
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:00,000
picture in another area's mechanism of

2902
01:40:58,158 --> 01:41:01,679
action how do these drugs work

2903
01:41:00,000 --> 01:41:04,238
phase two you're trying to figure out

2904
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:06,158
what they do

2905
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:07,279
who your patient population is what are

2906
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:09,599
the risks who do you

2907
01:41:07,279 --> 01:41:11,679
include who do you exclude what are the

2908
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:14,800
doses what is your treatment

2909
01:41:11,679 --> 01:41:18,000
what are your measures

2910
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:19,440
in our case it was um you know how do

2911
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:21,760
you do a double blind study

2912
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:23,039
that was a big part of phase two that's

2913
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:24,960
a big challenge for

2914
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:27,039
psychedelic drugs any kind of drugs that

2915
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,399
have a real strong effect

2916
01:41:27,039 --> 01:41:30,319
you know how do you do a double blind

2917
01:41:28,399 --> 01:41:33,679
study a double blind side to interrupt

2918
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:35,519
would mean that the patient should know

2919
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:37,279
should not be aware whether it's a

2920
01:41:35,520 --> 01:41:39,199
placebo or not

2921
01:41:37,279 --> 01:41:40,399
and the research and the researcher does

2922
01:41:39,198 --> 01:41:42,479
not is not aware

2923
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:43,839
and so for that lack of awareness when

2924
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:45,439
the effect is really strong is very

2925
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:46,000
difficult to do on both the researcher

2926
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:48,879
and the patient

2927
01:41:46,000 --> 01:41:50,479
side yes and sometimes fascinating they

2928
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:52,719
talk about triple blind

2929
01:41:50,479 --> 01:41:54,479
so the other part is the raters that

2930
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:56,399
evaluate the symptoms and

2931
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:58,319
before and after so you ideally want

2932
01:41:56,399 --> 01:42:01,279
triple blind do you want the patients

2933
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:02,399
the researchers and the evaluators of

2934
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:05,198
the outcomes

2935
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:06,638
all of them not to know what the drug

2936
01:42:05,198 --> 01:42:07,519
whether it was drug or placebo and

2937
01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:11,199
that's to reduce

2938
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:13,199
experiment or bias so

2939
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:15,678
and then then you move to phase three

2940
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:17,599
once you've figured out how to design

2941
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:18,960
the phase three studies and phase three

2942
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:20,800
are the large-scale

2943
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:22,000
multi-site placebo-controlled

2944
01:42:20,800 --> 01:42:24,719
double-blind

2945
01:42:22,000 --> 01:42:25,679
studies where you must prove safety and

2946
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:28,158
efficacy

2947
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:29,920
in order to get permission to market the

2948
01:42:28,158 --> 01:42:34,079
drug

2949
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:35,440
now for us when we started maps in 86

2950
01:42:34,079 --> 01:42:38,079
as i said it was one year after the

2951
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:40,158
criminalization of mdma in 85

2952
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:42,639
we had five different protocols that

2953
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:44,559
were rejected by the fda

2954
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:46,960
for studying with mdma and these were

2955
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:48,639
all various phase one studies

2956
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,800
they came from harvard from uc san

2957
01:42:48,639 --> 01:42:53,039
francisco from the university of in

2958
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:57,520
arizona and albuquerque new mexico

2959
01:42:53,039 --> 01:42:59,679
all over and they were all rejected 1992

2960
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,960
um six years after we started we got the

2961
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:04,158
first permission

2962
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:05,760
for phase one and that took us through

2963
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:07,679
much of the 90s

2964
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:10,800
again things are slow because we have to

2965
01:43:07,679 --> 01:43:13,600
raise the money through donations and

2966
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,400
and then in 1999 is when we started the

2967
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:20,320
work with

2968
01:43:14,399 --> 01:43:20,319
ptsd and that then took us till

2969
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:26,238
november 29 2016.

2970
01:43:24,158 --> 01:43:27,439
which is when we had the end of phase 2

2971
01:43:26,238 --> 01:43:30,158
meeting with fda

2972
01:43:27,439 --> 01:43:32,319
so it took 30 years from the start of

2973
01:43:30,158 --> 01:43:33,279
maps to the end of phase 2 meeting with

2974
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:35,599
fda

2975
01:43:33,279 --> 01:43:37,118
and what we had discovered during phase

2976
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:40,400
2

2977
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:42,719
was several different key points

2978
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:43,679
the drugs that are available right now

2979
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,719
for ptsd

2980
01:43:43,679 --> 01:43:48,319
the ssris zoloft and paxil

2981
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:49,760
that have been approved by fda and

2982
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:51,599
regulators in europe as well the

2983
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:55,119
european medicines agency

2984
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,920
for ptsd they work better in women than

2985
01:43:55,118 --> 01:43:59,839
in men

2986
01:43:55,920 --> 01:44:01,719
and they failed in combat related ptsd

2987
01:43:59,840 --> 01:44:03,360
all right so what we learned is that

2988
01:44:01,719 --> 01:44:05,359
mdma-assisted therapy

2989
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:07,759
works just as well in men or women and

2990
01:44:05,359 --> 01:44:09,679
it works in combat related ptsd

2991
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:12,400
it works in regardless of the cause of

2992
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:14,880
ptsd we also discovered that

2993
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:16,638
even though there are stories that you

2994
01:44:14,880 --> 01:44:18,400
know people take mdm at raves and they

2995
01:44:16,639 --> 01:44:20,079
dance all night and they overheat and

2996
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:22,238
they get hypothermia and they die from

2997
01:44:20,079 --> 01:44:24,559
overheating which is true and can happen

2998
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:26,238
from pure mdma

2999
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:28,480
or that sometimes people have heard

3000
01:44:26,238 --> 01:44:31,279
about needing to cool down

3001
01:44:28,479 --> 01:44:31,678
and so they drink water and then while

3002
01:44:31,279 --> 01:44:33,359
they're

3003
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:35,039
dancing all night and then they drink

3004
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:36,319
too much water and then they dilute

3005
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:37,760
their blood and they die from

3006
01:44:36,319 --> 01:44:40,079
hyponatremia

3007
01:44:37,760 --> 01:44:42,079
so there are risks of mdma but we

3008
01:44:40,079 --> 01:44:43,840
discovered that in a therapeutic setting

3009
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:45,840
we can control all those risks those

3010
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:48,079
things don't happen at all

3011
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:50,719
so we discovered safety we could we

3012
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:53,920
could demonstrate safety

3013
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:56,480
we also figured out that our measure

3014
01:44:53,920 --> 01:44:58,000
the caps the clinician-administered ptsd

3015
01:44:56,479 --> 01:44:59,519
scale that it's the

3016
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,359
gold standard all over the world for

3017
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:02,400
measuring ptsd symptoms it's what the

3018
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:04,880
fda and the e may

3019
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:06,799
require we discovered that it was a good

3020
01:45:04,880 --> 01:45:09,920
measure for us and that we could show

3021
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:12,880
changes in that the other

3022
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:13,920
big thing that we learned is that um and

3023
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:16,639
we haven't mentioned this

3024
01:45:13,920 --> 01:45:18,639
yet but the work in the 50s and 60s with

3025
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:20,239
lsd and psilocybin and the modern

3026
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:22,079
research over the last 20 years with

3027
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:23,279
psilocybin and classic psychedelics has

3028
01:45:22,079 --> 01:45:24,880
demonstrated

3029
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:26,639
that there's a link between this

3030
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:28,239
mystical experience this unit of

3031
01:45:26,639 --> 01:45:29,279
mystical experience and therapeutic

3032
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:31,118
outcomes

3033
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:32,479
for the treatment of addiction for

3034
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:33,198
working with people's life-threatening

3035
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:36,158
illnesses

3036
01:45:33,198 --> 01:45:37,599
you know that for ocd for

3037
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:38,399
obsessive-compulsive disorder that

3038
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:40,880
there's

3039
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:42,879
with the classic psychedelics both in

3040
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:44,159
the 50 years ago and then the research

3041
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:45,920
now has been

3042
01:45:44,158 --> 01:45:48,079
that there's a link between the depth of

3043
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,199
the mystical experience and therapeutic

3044
01:45:48,079 --> 01:45:50,960
outcome

3045
01:45:49,198 --> 01:45:52,879
what we discovered is that that's not

3046
01:45:50,960 --> 01:45:56,000
the case for mdma

3047
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:57,760
that people do score fairly high on the

3048
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,000
scales of mystical experience not as

3049
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:59,760
high

3050
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,760
as they do with the classic psychedelics

3051
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:04,960
but they do score pretty high

3052
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:05,600
on average and a significant number of

3053
01:46:04,960 --> 01:46:06,800
them have

3054
01:46:05,600 --> 01:46:09,119
over the cutoff for what would be

3055
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:11,199
considered a full mystical experience

3056
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:13,599
so enough to say that we could look at a

3057
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:15,279
correlation and we didn't find any

3058
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,880
the other thing that we discovered and

3059
01:46:15,279 --> 01:46:19,039
this was

3060
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,920
more humbling i would say for me

3061
01:46:19,039 --> 01:46:21,840
personally

3062
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:24,158
is that my dissertation at the kennedy

3063
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:26,000
school a big part of it was on the

3064
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:27,759
it's about the regulation of the medical

3065
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,439
use of psychedelics and marijuana

3066
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:30,800
big part of my dissertation was how to

3067
01:46:29,439 --> 01:46:32,638
do the double-blind

3068
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:34,400
study and i thought i'd solve the

3069
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:36,079
problem and i persuaded my

3070
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:37,439
dissertation committee that i'd solved

3071
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:40,079
the problem

3072
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:41,198
and the solution was therapy with

3073
01:46:40,079 --> 01:46:44,399
low-dose mdma

3074
01:46:41,198 --> 01:46:45,519
versus therapy with full-dose mdma and

3075
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:48,000
everybody knows that they're going to

3076
01:46:45,520 --> 01:46:49,119
get mdma most of these people have never

3077
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,719
done it before

3078
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:52,559
they'll be confused about is at full

3079
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:55,760
dose or low dose

3080
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:57,199
and then the challenge is uh to pick a

3081
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:59,280
dose that's

3082
01:46:57,198 --> 01:47:01,359
high enough so that there is this

3083
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:02,719
confusion but not so high that it's so

3084
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:04,719
therapeutic that we can't tell the

3085
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:07,760
difference between the groups

3086
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:09,279
so we we studied zero meaning inactive

3087
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:11,360
placebo

3088
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:13,679
25 milligrams 30 milligrams 40

3089
01:47:11,359 --> 01:47:18,000
milligrams 50 milligrams 75 milligrams

3090
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:19,920
100 milligrams 125 and 150.

3091
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,719
what we discovered is that my

3092
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:24,399
dissertation was wrong and that

3093
01:47:22,719 --> 01:47:26,800
there is no good solution to the

3094
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:30,719
double-blind problem

3095
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:33,360
um what we found is that to our surprise

3096
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:34,719
actually was that 75 milligrams was an

3097
01:47:33,359 --> 01:47:37,519
effective dose

3098
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:38,960
oh wow we didn't think that i mean the

3099
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:41,040
normal doses like

3100
01:47:38,960 --> 01:47:42,480
full dose is like 125 milligrams

3101
01:47:41,039 --> 01:47:45,439
something like that

3102
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:47,839
but 75 milligrams was an effective dose

3103
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:50,000
and we discovered that the lower doses

3104
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:51,119
so i was i was half right you could say

3105
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:54,719
the the doses

3106
01:47:51,118 --> 01:47:57,439
of 25 30 40 50 they they could

3107
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:58,880
produce enough confusion that you could

3108
01:47:57,439 --> 01:48:00,399
say that they were successful at

3109
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:03,199
blinding not perfectly but

3110
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:04,158
enough confusion so that people

3111
01:48:03,198 --> 01:48:06,399
therapists couldn't

3112
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:09,679
know for sure so that so that there was

3113
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:13,118
this reduction of bias you could say

3114
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:15,440
but what we discovered again to

3115
01:48:13,118 --> 01:48:17,359
to our surprise was that the low doses

3116
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:20,559
made people uncomfortable

3117
01:48:17,359 --> 01:48:24,000
they they stimulated them

3118
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:26,800
but they didn't reduce the fear and so

3119
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:29,279
people still got better with the therapy

3120
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:32,159
with low-dose mdma but if we gave them

3121
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:33,840
therapy with inactive placebo they did

3122
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:35,599
even better

3123
01:48:33,840 --> 01:48:37,360
than if we gave them therapy with

3124
01:48:35,600 --> 01:48:40,239
low-dose mdma

3125
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:41,039
so we we call it an anti-therapeutic

3126
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:43,118
effect

3127
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:45,359
well i don't mean to imply that they got

3128
01:48:43,118 --> 01:48:47,599
worse but it made people uncomfortable

3129
01:48:45,359 --> 01:48:49,839
people didn't like it you know but we

3130
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:52,239
would still help them make some progress

3131
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:54,319
so we had the blinding but what what it

3132
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,319
meant by reducing the effect of

3133
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:58,238
therapy with inactive placebo is that it

3134
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:01,039
would make it easier for us to find a

3135
01:48:58,238 --> 01:49:03,279
difference between the two groups

3136
01:49:01,039 --> 01:49:04,719
and so the real question is if you can

3137
01:49:03,279 --> 01:49:08,399
do it with therapy

3138
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:09,198
why bother at a drug so we went to the

3139
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:11,279
fda

3140
01:49:09,198 --> 01:49:13,039
and and so this was what we discovered

3141
01:49:11,279 --> 01:49:14,000
during phase two we went to the fda at

3142
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:16,319
this end of phase two

3143
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:17,599
meeting and we said we can give you

3144
01:49:16,319 --> 01:49:20,319
blinding

3145
01:49:17,599 --> 01:49:22,000
but it will make it easier for us to

3146
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:23,198
find a difference between the two groups

3147
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:26,319
and so we suggest

3148
01:49:23,198 --> 01:49:29,439
that we do therapy with inactive placebo

3149
01:49:26,319 --> 01:49:31,679
versus therapy with full dose mdma

3150
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:33,359
that will cause a problem because most

3151
01:49:31,679 --> 01:49:33,760
people will be able to tell what they've

3152
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:37,039
got

3153
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:38,800
yeah what um tom lawforn a doctor who

3154
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:40,079
used to be head of psychiatry products

3155
01:49:38,800 --> 01:49:42,800
at fda is our

3156
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:44,639
main advisor so the first thing he said

3157
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:47,360
is that the double blind fails in

3158
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:49,359
practice a lot even with ssris

3159
01:49:47,359 --> 01:49:50,960
because there are certain side effects

3160
01:49:49,359 --> 01:49:52,559
that you have with these drugs and the

3161
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,279
doctors who are doing these research

3162
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,520
when you're

3163
01:49:53,279 --> 01:49:57,039
reporting your side effects they can say

3164
01:49:55,520 --> 01:49:58,800
oh that's probably you got the active

3165
01:49:57,039 --> 01:50:01,118
drug instead of the placebo so

3166
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:03,360
the double blind is in theory is

3167
01:50:01,118 --> 01:50:05,759
terrific but in practice

3168
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:08,000
it doesn't always work quite as well yes

3169
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:08,800
and so what tom said is that there are

3170
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:10,960
two

3171
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:13,199
main approaches that they think are

3172
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:16,079
important to reduce bias

3173
01:50:13,198 --> 01:50:17,759
the first one is easy to do it's called

3174
01:50:16,079 --> 01:50:19,679
random assignment

3175
01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:21,440
so you know sometimes there are studies

3176
01:50:19,679 --> 01:50:23,359
where you know you'll you'll treat a

3177
01:50:21,439 --> 01:50:25,198
bunch of people

3178
01:50:23,359 --> 01:50:27,039
with something and some fraction of them

3179
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:27,598
will get better and some won't and then

3180
01:50:27,039 --> 01:50:29,279
you say

3181
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:31,760
okay all those who didn't get better who

3182
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:33,118
volunteers to get this new treatment

3183
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:34,639
and then you give them the new treatment

3184
01:50:33,118 --> 01:50:36,479
but the people that volunteer are more

3185
01:50:34,639 --> 01:50:38,639
likely to want to get better they're not

3186
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:40,638
representative sample of everybody that

3187
01:50:38,639 --> 01:50:41,599
has these so when you have random

3188
01:50:40,639 --> 01:50:44,319
assignment

3189
01:50:41,599 --> 01:50:45,920
everybody is similarly motivated and has

3190
01:50:44,319 --> 01:50:47,198
meets the same inclusion exclusion

3191
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:49,199
criteria

3192
01:50:47,198 --> 01:50:50,399
so that's what we talked of course we

3193
01:50:49,198 --> 01:50:53,678
need random assignment

3194
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:55,839
the other part was when the bias double

3195
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:59,760
blind doesn't work as well

3196
01:50:55,840 --> 01:51:02,639
then the system of independent raiders

3197
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:03,679
is especially important of how you do

3198
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:07,118
that so we

3199
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:09,599
have over a pool of raiders

3200
01:51:07,118 --> 01:51:11,759
over 20 of them and we do this monthly

3201
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:14,319
in inter-rater reliability tests

3202
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:15,840
to make sure that they um you know

3203
01:51:14,319 --> 01:51:17,759
evaluate the so that they're given a

3204
01:51:15,840 --> 01:51:19,520
videotape of a ptsd patient and then

3205
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,119
they're supposed to rate them

3206
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,119
according to their symptoms and then

3207
01:51:21,118 --> 01:51:23,439
then we sort of make sure that we've got

3208
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:26,799
this

3209
01:51:23,439 --> 01:51:27,919
calibrated raider pool and it's all done

3210
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,520
by zoom by

3211
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:31,359
telemedicine and they're randomly

3212
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,480
assigned to the next person that needs a

3213
01:51:31,359 --> 01:51:34,479
rating

3214
01:51:32,479 --> 01:51:35,759
so they said 20 raiders yeah so we've

3215
01:51:34,479 --> 01:51:38,799
got like 20 raiders

3216
01:51:35,760 --> 01:51:41,039
and um we want what we want to do is is

3217
01:51:38,800 --> 01:51:42,000
make it so that each raider sees each

3218
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:44,719
patient

3219
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:47,039
only once maybe twice but but not

3220
01:51:44,719 --> 01:51:48,960
tracking them through the study

3221
01:51:47,039 --> 01:51:50,479
so that guys to reduce the bias in the

3222
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,079
raiders that they they don't know where

3223
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:55,919
this person is in the study

3224
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:59,198
yes um and then and so

3225
01:51:55,920 --> 01:52:01,199
there's a fellow um bob temple who's

3226
01:51:59,198 --> 01:52:04,000
like the old wise man at the fda

3227
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:05,759
he's been there since 1972 he was in

3228
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,279
charge of the office of science policy

3229
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,159
and they brought him into the final

3230
01:52:07,279 --> 01:52:11,279
meeting of this

3231
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:13,359
um process where we are trying to design

3232
01:52:11,279 --> 01:52:14,479
phase three so once fda said yes you can

3233
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:17,759
go to phase three

3234
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:20,399
that was november 29 2016.

3235
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:22,560
we then negotiated for eight months on

3236
01:52:20,399 --> 01:52:24,399
the design of phase three and all of the

3237
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:26,639
other information this is fascinating

3238
01:52:24,399 --> 01:52:27,759
it's gonna need this process of design

3239
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:30,319
ah it was

3240
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:32,000
you know to the extent that i have any

3241
01:52:30,319 --> 01:52:35,439
uh artistic creativity

3242
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:37,439
it's in protocol design i really love

3243
01:52:35,439 --> 01:52:39,359
that so you enjoy this process i love it

3244
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:39,919
i love it because it's always trade-offs

3245
01:52:39,359 --> 01:52:42,799
and it's

3246
01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:43,279
um yeah it's you know and i acknowledge

3247
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:46,000
you know

3248
01:52:43,279 --> 01:52:47,118
that we are all biased and so how do you

3249
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:50,158
there's something beautiful

3250
01:52:47,118 --> 01:52:51,359
about the scientific process designed to

3251
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:54,000
get you to the truth

3252
01:52:51,359 --> 01:52:55,839
um especially when that scientific

3253
01:52:54,000 --> 01:52:56,479
process is trying to get to the truth of

3254
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:58,880
the human

3255
01:52:56,479 --> 01:53:00,799
organism which is so complicated so it's

3256
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:03,039
very difficult to uh

3257
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,320
to dissect to do to get the the the

3258
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:06,639
strong effects

3259
01:53:04,319 --> 01:53:08,000
and when you're analyzing when you have

3260
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:11,118
like raiders they're

3261
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:13,679
they're watching a video

3262
01:53:11,118 --> 01:53:15,359
there's removing subjectivity from that

3263
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:18,719
is very very challenging

3264
01:53:15,359 --> 01:53:21,039
yeah very very much so um

3265
01:53:18,719 --> 01:53:21,760
and so we came to this agreement with

3266
01:53:21,039 --> 01:53:24,800
fda though

3267
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:27,599
that we would um use this uh independent

3268
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:30,719
raider pool and

3269
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:32,319
and so we learned in in phase two again

3270
01:53:30,719 --> 01:53:34,158
that the double blind there was no

3271
01:53:32,319 --> 01:53:35,359
solution to the double blind problem and

3272
01:53:34,158 --> 01:53:37,279
and both the fda

3273
01:53:35,359 --> 01:53:38,399
and the european medicines agency in the

3274
01:53:37,279 --> 01:53:40,479
end agreed

3275
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:41,759
that the best design was therapy with

3276
01:53:40,479 --> 01:53:43,839
inactive placebo

3277
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:45,599
versus therapy with full dose mdma

3278
01:53:43,840 --> 01:53:46,719
accepting the fact that most people will

3279
01:53:45,599 --> 01:53:48,400
be able to tell

3280
01:53:46,719 --> 01:53:50,158
what whether they got nothing or they

3281
01:53:48,399 --> 01:53:51,839
got full dose mdma

3282
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:54,079
most therapists will be able to tell the

3283
01:53:51,840 --> 01:53:56,159
difference but

3284
01:53:54,079 --> 01:53:57,679
that makes a harder test for us to show

3285
01:53:56,158 --> 01:53:59,519
a difference between the two groups

3286
01:53:57,679 --> 01:54:01,440
because we're giving them inactive

3287
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:03,920
placebo and not the anti-therapeutic

3288
01:54:01,439 --> 01:54:06,399
effect of low-dose mdma

3289
01:54:03,920 --> 01:54:08,158
so once we started phase three so then

3290
01:54:06,399 --> 01:54:11,598
we were able to start

3291
01:54:08,158 --> 01:54:13,598
in 2018 phase three and the paper

3292
01:54:11,599 --> 01:54:15,199
in nature medicine that just came out

3293
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:18,159
was the

3294
01:54:15,198 --> 01:54:18,559
results of our first phase three study

3295
01:54:18,158 --> 01:54:20,638
we

3296
01:54:18,560 --> 01:54:21,599
came to agreement with fda that we would

3297
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:23,920
do two

3298
01:54:21,599 --> 01:54:25,840
phase three studies each would have 100

3299
01:54:23,920 --> 01:54:28,880
persons in them

3300
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:30,480
and what the fda said to us is that they

3301
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:33,760
thought that we could prove

3302
01:54:30,479 --> 01:54:36,399
efficacy with smaller numbers than they

3303
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:38,079
wanted to see for safety

3304
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:41,279
the reason they said that is that in

3305
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:43,679
phase two we had a large effect size

3306
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:44,479
so from a statistical point of view the

3307
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:47,599
bigger of an

3308
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:49,439
effect that you're looking for the fewer

3309
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:51,199
number of people you need to get

3310
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:52,638
statistical significance

3311
01:54:51,198 --> 01:54:54,399
when you're trying to find small

3312
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:55,679
differences you need large numbers of

3313
01:54:54,399 --> 01:54:59,759
people to

3314
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:02,158
sort of work out the noise um

3315
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:04,880
so we were we came to agreement on two

3316
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:06,960
100 person phase three studies

3317
01:55:04,880 --> 01:55:08,079
uh and the idea is that it's very

3318
01:55:06,960 --> 01:55:09,840
possible that the

3319
01:55:08,079 --> 01:55:11,118
the first part the first study would

3320
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:13,440
show the efficacy

3321
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:15,198
because the effect is so strong yeah

3322
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:18,238
yeah and the second but but also

3323
01:55:15,198 --> 01:55:20,000
safety as well so so you know one of the

3324
01:55:18,238 --> 01:55:22,238
things we also realized when you work

3325
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,599
with a highly stigmatized drug

3326
01:55:22,238 --> 01:55:27,598
in the midst of still you know the drug

3327
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:31,279
war and prohibition that we need

3328
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:33,920
highly sympathetic subjects

3329
01:55:31,279 --> 01:55:35,198
and we need to make the best case we can

3330
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:36,960
which means we need to work with the

3331
01:55:35,198 --> 01:55:39,039
hardest cases

3332
01:55:36,960 --> 01:55:40,800
so that this is really needed and so we

3333
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:44,960
end up enrolling people

3334
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:47,360
the first study was chronic severe ptsd

3335
01:55:44,960 --> 01:55:48,800
and unlike many studies of ptsd we

3336
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:50,559
enroll people that have previously

3337
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:53,199
attempted suicide

3338
01:55:50,560 --> 01:55:54,639
wow so we have multiple people that have

3339
01:55:53,198 --> 01:55:56,879
tried to kill themselves

3340
01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:58,319
that we felt like um if we were to

3341
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:59,359
exclude them what are we doing

3342
01:55:58,319 --> 01:56:02,079
those are the people that need it the

3343
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:04,238
most so

3344
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:05,840
we we came to this agreement with fda

3345
01:56:04,238 --> 01:56:09,039
we're going to work with

3346
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,239
chronic severe ptsd patients

3347
01:56:09,039 --> 01:56:12,560
including those that had attempted

3348
01:56:10,238 --> 01:56:14,799
suicide and

3349
01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:15,840
we would do these two 100 person studies

3350
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,920
and

3351
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:19,760
we also negotiated what's called an

3352
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:22,639
interim analysis

3353
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:23,199
so what that means is that when the

3354
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:26,400
study

3355
01:56:23,198 --> 01:56:28,799
is um underway

3356
01:56:26,399 --> 01:56:30,319
um and often big big studies they have

3357
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,320
this kind of interim analysis

3358
01:56:30,319 --> 01:56:34,158
where what you do is and for us we

3359
01:56:32,319 --> 01:56:36,079
negotiated when we had 60

3360
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:37,279
or 60 people had reached the primary

3361
01:56:36,079 --> 01:56:40,000
outcome measure

3362
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:42,000
and all hundred had been enrolled then

3363
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:46,000
we would take a look at the data

3364
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,960
and if the statistical analysis that we

3365
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:51,359
did

3366
01:56:46,960 --> 01:56:53,198
was showing you know based on a certain

3367
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:54,880
effect size that we chose based on what

3368
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:56,638
we saw in phase two

3369
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:59,118
the interim analysis is for what's

3370
01:56:56,639 --> 01:57:00,639
called sample size re-estimation

3371
01:56:59,118 --> 01:57:02,000
so what it means is if the results

3372
01:57:00,639 --> 01:57:04,000
aren't as good as you thought they would

3373
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:06,079
you can add more people

3374
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,599
and then you'll get statistical

3375
01:57:06,079 --> 01:57:09,039
significance

3376
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:11,039
it means that your effect isn't as

3377
01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:13,118
strong as you thought it'll be harder to

3378
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:14,319
get insurance to coverage but fda will

3379
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:17,198
still approve it

3380
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:17,599
because fdl also believes that these are

3381
01:57:17,198 --> 01:57:19,759
group

3382
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:21,360
averages there may be some people that

3383
01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:22,400
will later figure out respond better

3384
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:23,679
than others

3385
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:25,598
so they'll approve it if it's

3386
01:57:23,679 --> 01:57:27,199
statistically significant even if it has

3387
01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:30,639
a low effect size

3388
01:57:27,198 --> 01:57:34,559
the ssris have low effect size so

3389
01:57:30,639 --> 01:57:35,760
we did the interim analysis in march of

3390
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:38,080
2020

3391
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:38,960
and what we discovered to our delight

3392
01:57:38,079 --> 01:57:41,599
was that

3393
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,840
um we did not need to add any subjects

3394
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:46,159
that's all we were told we weren't told

3395
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:47,599
like what is the results we were just

3396
01:57:46,158 --> 01:57:48,158
told all we were going to get is a

3397
01:57:47,599 --> 01:57:50,079
number

3398
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:51,519
zero or you need to add x numbers of

3399
01:57:50,079 --> 01:57:53,599
people to the study to get the

3400
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:55,280
statistical significance that's right

3401
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:57,760
around the time that covet hit

3402
01:57:55,279 --> 01:57:59,920
and lockdowns happened and we ended up

3403
01:57:57,760 --> 01:58:04,320
negotiating with fda that we would end

3404
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:04,319
the study with 90 people instead of 100.

3405
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:08,319
it took a while for us to end up doing

3406
01:58:06,319 --> 01:58:11,359
that so the paper that we just published

3407
01:58:08,319 --> 01:58:14,238
is on the results of 90 people i think

3408
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:17,759
it was 46 in the mdma group 44 in the

3409
01:58:14,238 --> 01:58:21,039
placebo group and what we

3410
01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:23,199
discovered was that the study worked

3411
01:58:21,039 --> 01:58:25,840
better than we had even hoped

3412
01:58:23,198 --> 01:58:27,598
so the first thing is that you look at

3413
01:58:25,840 --> 01:58:28,480
statistical significance you have to get

3414
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:30,159
0.05

3415
01:58:28,479 --> 01:58:32,319
which basically means a nickel out of a

3416
01:58:30,158 --> 01:58:33,839
dollar a 1 in 20 chance

3417
01:58:32,319 --> 01:58:36,238
that the difference between the two

3418
01:58:33,840 --> 01:58:38,079
groups is due to some random factor

3419
01:58:36,238 --> 01:58:40,959
rather than to your intervention

3420
01:58:38,079 --> 01:58:42,800
and in this case the the placebo group

3421
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:45,198
gets therapy

3422
01:58:42,800 --> 01:58:46,719
and then with inactive placebo and then

3423
01:58:45,198 --> 01:58:50,000
the

3424
01:58:46,719 --> 01:58:52,880
group gets mdma with active placebo so

3425
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:53,920
you have to get .05 there's another

3426
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:55,760
measure

3427
01:58:53,920 --> 01:58:58,000
that the fda uses sometimes called

3428
01:58:55,760 --> 01:59:00,159
robust which means

3429
01:58:58,000 --> 01:59:02,000
one in a thousand instead of one in

3430
01:59:00,158 --> 01:59:03,039
twenty one in a thousand and if you get

3431
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:06,560
a robust

3432
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:09,679
results .001

3433
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:11,679
and you meet some other criteria they

3434
01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:12,560
might agree to approve the drug on the

3435
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:15,039
basis of just

3436
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:16,000
one phase three study instead of two

3437
01:59:15,039 --> 01:59:18,399
because when you think about

3438
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:19,039
it a one in 20 chance for your first

3439
01:59:18,399 --> 01:59:21,198
seconds to

3440
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:23,198
a phase three study a one in 20 chance

3441
01:59:21,198 --> 01:59:24,799
for your second phase three study you

3442
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:25,759
multiply that together it's one in four

3443
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:30,800
hundred

3444
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:34,960
point zero um two five um

3445
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:36,320
that's pretty good so robust .001 is

3446
01:59:34,960 --> 01:59:38,639
even better than

3447
01:59:36,319 --> 01:59:41,118
two independent phase three studies each

3448
01:59:38,639 --> 01:59:43,118
at .05

3449
01:59:41,118 --> 01:59:44,158
what we ended up getting was one in ten

3450
01:59:43,118 --> 01:59:47,439
thousand point zero

3451
01:59:44,158 --> 01:59:50,158
zero zero one outrageous

3452
01:59:47,439 --> 01:59:51,678
yeah you know incredibly so that's a

3453
01:59:50,158 --> 01:59:54,479
measure of both the difference between

3454
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:57,199
the two groups and the variability

3455
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:58,718
and so what it meant is that we had

3456
01:59:57,198 --> 02:00:01,359
minimal variability

3457
01:59:58,719 --> 02:00:02,000
that most people who got to mba got

3458
02:00:01,359 --> 02:00:03,920
quite a large

3459
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:05,118
amount of benefit from it and most

3460
02:00:03,920 --> 02:00:06,639
people who got the placebo

3461
02:00:05,118 --> 02:00:08,799
were more or less in the same range as

3462
02:00:06,639 --> 02:00:09,420
well that's really exciting by the way i

3463
02:00:08,800 --> 02:00:11,199
mean

3464
02:00:09,420 --> 02:00:13,679
[Laughter]

3465
02:00:11,198 --> 02:00:14,479
mean i i i suppose it's exciting from a

3466
02:00:13,679 --> 02:00:17,279
perspective of

3467
02:00:14,479 --> 02:00:19,598
approval by the fda maybe perhaps that's

3468
02:00:17,279 --> 02:00:23,039
the way you're seeing it but it's also

3469
02:00:19,599 --> 02:00:24,880
exciting because it's it has a chance to

3470
02:00:23,039 --> 02:00:28,238
help people that are truly suffering

3471
02:00:24,880 --> 02:00:31,279
yeah well if we can get one in uh 10

3472
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:33,198
000 in the first phase three study

3473
02:00:31,279 --> 02:00:34,319
chances are we can get one in 20 in the

3474
02:00:33,198 --> 02:00:36,399
second

3475
02:00:34,319 --> 02:00:38,319
so it's really going to be about safety

3476
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:41,519
for us in the second phase three study

3477
02:00:38,319 --> 02:00:45,679
yeah now you can have

3478
02:00:41,520 --> 02:00:48,239
a large p value a large significance

3479
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:49,599
but you could have an effect that's not

3480
02:00:48,238 --> 02:00:51,279
very significant

3481
02:00:49,599 --> 02:00:53,360
it's not clinically significant you can

3482
02:00:51,279 --> 02:00:56,479
have statistical significance without

3483
02:00:53,359 --> 02:00:58,079
clinical significance and as i said the

3484
02:00:56,479 --> 02:00:59,839
the more people you get in the study you

3485
02:00:58,079 --> 02:01:01,920
can find smaller and smaller differences

3486
02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:05,360
between two groups

3487
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:08,239
now we showed that we had um

3488
02:01:05,359 --> 02:01:09,198
a very large effect size so effect size

3489
02:01:08,238 --> 02:01:11,839
is based on

3490
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:13,519
um that scale you mentioned well well

3491
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:17,199
the scale of the effect size

3492
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:19,920
is based on standard deviations

3493
02:01:17,198 --> 02:01:22,000
so an effect size of one means that your

3494
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:24,239
results are one standard deviation away

3495
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:25,920
from the norm that's considered very

3496
02:01:24,238 --> 02:01:28,959
large

3497
02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:31,359
the the ssris because they have they

3498
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:33,359
were like .3.4

3499
02:01:31,359 --> 02:01:35,198
effect size that's considered small

3500
02:01:33,359 --> 02:01:36,960
effect size medium is starting to be

3501
02:01:35,198 --> 02:01:41,439
around 0.6

3502
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:44,880
and 0.8 and above are large effect sizes

3503
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:46,319
we had what's called placebo subtracted

3504
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:48,000
effect size there's two different ways

3505
02:01:46,319 --> 02:01:49,279
to look at it placebo subtracted means

3506
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:50,000
you kind of look at the difference

3507
02:01:49,279 --> 02:01:53,279
between your two

3508
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:54,880
groups and and what that is for us since

3509
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:57,599
one group had therapy and one had

3510
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:58,800
therapy plus mdma the placebo subtracted

3511
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:01,840
effect size

3512
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:03,119
is basically the effect of just the mdma

3513
02:02:01,840 --> 02:02:05,199
because you've kind of washed out the

3514
02:02:03,118 --> 02:02:08,079
therapy that was 0.91

3515
02:02:05,198 --> 02:02:08,479
so we had a large effect size which was

3516
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:11,279
different

3517
02:02:08,479 --> 02:02:13,039
wow over so 0.91 over the just the

3518
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:16,399
therapy so over the placebo

3519
02:02:13,039 --> 02:02:18,719
yeah wow now when we do the

3520
02:02:16,399 --> 02:02:19,839
within group meaning the group that just

3521
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:22,480
got the

3522
02:02:19,840 --> 02:02:23,840
mdma plus therapy look at their baseline

3523
02:02:22,479 --> 02:02:25,359
and their outcomes

3524
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,719
that's another way to look at it and

3525
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:28,000
that's what's going to actually happen

3526
02:02:26,719 --> 02:02:29,920
in practice because people are going to

3527
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:32,960
get mdma plus

3528
02:02:29,920 --> 02:02:34,960
therapy that's 2.1 effect size two

3529
02:02:32,960 --> 02:02:38,158
standard deviations away from the norm

3530
02:02:34,960 --> 02:02:42,079
is enormous effect size yeah

3531
02:02:38,158 --> 02:02:44,479
the other part is that we had

3532
02:02:42,079 --> 02:02:46,238
no effect by sight which is very

3533
02:02:44,479 --> 02:02:48,319
important so we had 15 sites two in

3534
02:02:46,238 --> 02:02:50,718
israel two in canada 11 throughout the

3535
02:02:48,319 --> 02:02:53,198
united states

3536
02:02:50,719 --> 02:02:54,800
the fda looks at is there a side effect

3537
02:02:53,198 --> 02:02:56,079
because what that might mean is maybe

3538
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:57,599
you've got all your patients

3539
02:02:56,079 --> 02:02:59,519
or most of your patients going to this

3540
02:02:57,599 --> 02:03:01,599
one site which is these highly

3541
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:03,040
experienced therapists and they're like

3542
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:04,159
you know hippies from way back

3543
02:03:03,039 --> 02:03:06,319
and they're super experienced with

3544
02:03:04,158 --> 02:03:07,679
psychedelics and you know and they're

3545
02:03:06,319 --> 02:03:09,118
they're getting great results but nobody

3546
02:03:07,679 --> 02:03:11,359
else gets good results

3547
02:03:09,118 --> 02:03:12,238
so we had no effect by sight which means

3548
02:03:11,359 --> 02:03:13,920
that's incredible

3549
02:03:12,238 --> 02:03:16,638
that we've been able to train all these

3550
02:03:13,920 --> 02:03:18,719
new therapists we had about um

3551
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:20,239
about 80 therapists working at all these

3552
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:23,439
15 sites

3553
02:03:20,238 --> 02:03:25,598
we also discovered that there's a group

3554
02:03:23,439 --> 02:03:27,439
that's considered to be

3555
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:29,840
very difficult to treat which is called

3556
02:03:27,439 --> 02:03:33,039
the dissociative subtype

3557
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:36,560
so when people are traumatized

3558
02:03:33,039 --> 02:03:37,679
one of the ways to psychologically

3559
02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:39,520
survive that

3560
02:03:37,679 --> 02:03:40,960
is you dissociate it's like you're not

3561
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:42,719
there

3562
02:03:40,960 --> 02:03:44,239
when you do that though it's hard to

3563
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:46,319
come back because when you come

3564
02:03:44,238 --> 02:03:48,799
back then you get all these painful

3565
02:03:46,319 --> 02:03:50,559
memories and fearful and so

3566
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:53,039
um the extreme of that is called

3567
02:03:50,560 --> 02:03:54,480
dissociative identity disorder

3568
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:56,399
kind of like schizophrenia almost

3569
02:03:54,479 --> 02:03:58,879
dissociative identity you're

3570
02:03:56,399 --> 02:03:59,759
so we let people in who are on the

3571
02:03:58,880 --> 02:04:02,078
dissociative

3572
02:03:59,760 --> 02:04:03,599
subtype and those are considered to be

3573
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:06,639
the hardest to treat because

3574
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:08,560
the the theory is that you need to be

3575
02:04:06,639 --> 02:04:10,000
ego intact as i said the mystical

3576
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:11,760
experience is not correlated

3577
02:04:10,000 --> 02:04:13,920
with therapeutic outcomes and you need

3578
02:04:11,760 --> 02:04:15,599
to be talking about what traumatized you

3579
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:18,000
and working through that and expressing

3580
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:21,199
it letting it out not keeping it in

3581
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:23,279
so the dissociative subtype

3582
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:24,879
seems like it's harder for them to get

3583
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:26,238
back into the event because they're so

3584
02:04:24,880 --> 02:04:28,159
dissociated

3585
02:04:26,238 --> 02:04:30,238
what we showed is that those people did

3586
02:04:28,158 --> 02:04:31,279
even better on average than everybody

3587
02:04:30,238 --> 02:04:33,759
else

3588
02:04:31,279 --> 02:04:34,479
so that mdma is integrative it helps

3589
02:04:33,760 --> 02:04:37,599
people

3590
02:04:34,479 --> 02:04:39,039
who are so separate that they make even

3591
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:41,360
more rapid progress

3592
02:04:39,039 --> 02:04:43,439
so it's almost like them dma made it

3593
02:04:41,359 --> 02:04:45,279
more difficult for them to dissociate

3594
02:04:43,439 --> 02:04:47,359
yes yeah or you could say it made it

3595
02:04:45,279 --> 02:04:49,519
easier for them to remember

3596
02:04:47,359 --> 02:04:51,519
yes exactly to reverse the dissociation

3597
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:54,880
yeah and we find that mdma

3598
02:04:51,520 --> 02:04:55,760
enhances memory for the trauma so that

3599
02:04:54,880 --> 02:04:58,078
you can have these

3600
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:59,520
unconscious uh memories or memories that

3601
02:04:58,078 --> 02:05:01,439
you cannot remember

3602
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:02,560
that you've suppressed so much but they

3603
02:05:01,439 --> 02:05:04,879
distort your view

3604
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:06,560
your filter of the world is distorted by

3605
02:05:04,880 --> 02:05:08,319
these fearful memories that the world

3606
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:10,000
can't be trusted people can't be trusted

3607
02:05:08,319 --> 02:05:12,719
it's always about to happen

3608
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:15,198
so we find that mdma increases memory

3609
02:05:12,719 --> 02:05:16,399
for the trauma but by reducing the fear

3610
02:05:15,198 --> 02:05:18,158
then the memories can come to the

3611
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:20,319
surface then you can process them let

3612
02:05:18,158 --> 02:05:24,078
out the emotions cry scream shake

3613
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:25,279
whatever and then through this mdma

3614
02:05:24,078 --> 02:05:27,118
effect on the amygdala and the

3615
02:05:25,279 --> 02:05:28,880
hippocampus it helps you

3616
02:05:27,118 --> 02:05:30,639
store these memories into long-term

3617
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:32,480
storage so that they're not always about

3618
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:33,760
to happen they're in the past

3619
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:36,000
they're part of your story but they're

3620
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:38,000
not the whole story so we discovered

3621
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:40,399
that the dissociative subtype

3622
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:41,118
works better now none of this would be

3623
02:05:40,399 --> 02:05:43,759
enough

3624
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:44,880
unless safety so from a safety

3625
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:46,880
perspective

3626
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:48,639
what we discovered is that there was one

3627
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:49,359
woman in the study that attempted to

3628
02:05:48,639 --> 02:05:52,639
kill herself

3629
02:05:49,359 --> 02:05:53,198
twice during the study there was another

3630
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:56,560
woman

3631
02:05:53,198 --> 02:05:58,479
that was so um

3632
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:59,920
worried that she might kill herself that

3633
02:05:58,479 --> 02:06:01,519
the therapy brought these things to the

3634
02:05:59,920 --> 02:06:02,319
surface that she's been pushing away

3635
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:04,320
that she

3636
02:06:02,319 --> 02:06:06,639
checked herself into a hospital in order

3637
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:08,399
to avoid self-harm

3638
02:06:06,639 --> 02:06:09,599
at the end of the study you know what we

3639
02:06:08,399 --> 02:06:11,679
learned is both of them were in the

3640
02:06:09,599 --> 02:06:14,159
placebo group

3641
02:06:11,679 --> 02:06:16,880
we didn't have anybody in the mdma group

3642
02:06:14,158 --> 02:06:20,319
attempt to kill themselves

3643
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:22,560
so the mdma is really

3644
02:06:20,319 --> 02:06:24,078
helpful for giving people a sense of

3645
02:06:22,560 --> 02:06:26,480
hope

3646
02:06:24,078 --> 02:06:27,118
and and that they can somehow process

3647
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:28,799
this

3648
02:06:27,118 --> 02:06:30,158
now it's not to say that nobody will

3649
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:32,239
ever commit suicide

3650
02:06:30,158 --> 02:06:34,078
and that's our big concern in the second

3651
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:35,519
phase iii study

3652
02:06:34,078 --> 02:06:37,198
as i said it's more going to be about

3653
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:38,639
safety than about efficacy we think

3654
02:06:37,198 --> 02:06:41,118
we'll get the efficacy but

3655
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:42,159
we're very concerned about you know

3656
02:06:41,118 --> 02:06:45,598
safety

3657
02:06:42,158 --> 02:06:46,799
because we had um problems in the first

3658
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:48,960
phase three study of somebody trying to

3659
02:06:46,800 --> 02:06:51,279
kill herself twice in the placebo group

3660
02:06:48,960 --> 02:06:52,800
you know it's it's the background for

3661
02:06:51,279 --> 02:06:54,719
having ptsd

3662
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:56,400
so there'd have to be a disproportionate

3663
02:06:54,719 --> 02:06:57,920
number of people in the mdma group

3664
02:06:56,399 --> 02:06:59,598
try to kill themselves or succeed in

3665
02:06:57,920 --> 02:07:00,319
killing themselves then in the placebo

3666
02:06:59,599 --> 02:07:03,039
group

3667
02:07:00,319 --> 02:07:04,238
for the fd to say oh this mdma it's too

3668
02:07:03,039 --> 02:07:06,960
dangerous it brings

3669
02:07:04,238 --> 02:07:08,319
we don't think that's going to happen so

3670
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:10,399
those are

3671
02:07:08,319 --> 02:07:12,479
the other findings are that this from

3672
02:07:10,399 --> 02:07:13,920
safety is that the side effects are

3673
02:07:12,479 --> 02:07:16,799
transitory they're minor

3674
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:18,000
they're they're um you know sweating or

3675
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:19,840
jaw clenching or

3676
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:21,198
you know slight temperature increase and

3677
02:07:19,840 --> 02:07:22,159
you know ev everybody that's been to a

3678
02:07:21,198 --> 02:07:24,158
rave knows about

3679
02:07:22,158 --> 02:07:26,000
you know taking ecstasy you know there

3680
02:07:24,158 --> 02:07:28,559
are some side effects

3681
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,679
but they're minor they're transitory and

3682
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:32,719
there has been this

3683
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,359
massive problem of um during the 80s the

3684
02:07:32,719 --> 02:07:35,039
90s

3685
02:07:33,359 --> 02:07:37,598
nida the nationalists on drug abuse was

3686
02:07:35,039 --> 02:07:39,279
trying to say that mdma was neurotoxic

3687
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:41,279
and that you take it and it's going to

3688
02:07:39,279 --> 02:07:42,158
cause nerve terminal degeneration it's

3689
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:43,439
going to be major

3690
02:07:42,158 --> 02:07:46,158
brain damage it's going to be

3691
02:07:43,439 --> 02:07:47,839
significant functional consequences and

3692
02:07:46,158 --> 02:07:49,359
back then they were saying that mdm is

3693
02:07:47,840 --> 02:07:50,800
too dangerous it should never even be

3694
02:07:49,359 --> 02:07:51,279
researched nobody should even get it

3695
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:54,079
once

3696
02:07:51,279 --> 02:07:55,118
because it's poison and brain damage

3697
02:07:54,078 --> 02:07:56,719
well

3698
02:07:55,118 --> 02:07:59,039
we no longer believe that that was

3699
02:07:56,719 --> 02:08:00,880
exaggerated that was um

3700
02:07:59,039 --> 02:08:03,118
you know in service of the drug war but

3701
02:08:00,880 --> 02:08:06,000
we've done in phase two

3702
02:08:03,118 --> 02:08:08,158
neurocognitive tests before and after in

3703
02:08:06,000 --> 02:08:10,800
two of our different sites and showed no

3704
02:08:08,158 --> 02:08:12,238
decline in cognitive functioning so we

3705
02:08:10,800 --> 02:08:15,440
we don't think that there's any

3706
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:16,559
um neurotoxicity happening and the doses

3707
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:18,000
that we use

3708
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:20,320
there's no obvious functional

3709
02:08:18,000 --> 02:08:22,158
consequences people are getting better

3710
02:08:20,319 --> 02:08:23,359
and the other thing that we've learned

3711
02:08:22,158 --> 02:08:24,799
in um

3712
02:08:23,359 --> 02:08:26,479
phase two and that we still have to

3713
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:27,440
learn from this study so what we showed

3714
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:29,439
is that

3715
02:08:27,439 --> 02:08:30,719
um is the durability of the effect we

3716
02:08:29,439 --> 02:08:32,960
showed that um

3717
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:35,279
32 percent of the people that got the

3718
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:37,279
therapy without mdma at two months after

3719
02:08:35,279 --> 02:08:38,719
the last experimental session no longer

3720
02:08:37,279 --> 02:08:40,319
had ptsd

3721
02:08:38,719 --> 02:08:42,158
just with the therapy which is

3722
02:08:40,319 --> 02:08:44,639
phenomenal because these are

3723
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:47,920
on average 14 years ptsd one-third had

3724
02:08:44,639 --> 02:08:50,960
ptsd over 20 years

3725
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:54,239
and just with the therapy

3726
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:56,319
32 no longer had ptsd at the two months

3727
02:08:54,238 --> 02:08:58,319
um however those people that got mdma it

3728
02:08:56,319 --> 02:09:00,799
was 67 percent

3729
02:08:58,319 --> 02:09:02,238
no longer had ptsd you know more than

3730
02:09:00,800 --> 02:09:04,960
twice as good

3731
02:09:02,238 --> 02:09:07,519
in phase two and in phase three we're

3732
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:09,840
also going to do the 12-month follow-up

3733
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:11,679
that's not for the fda that's not for

3734
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:12,319
approvability that's more for insurance

3735
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:14,158
companies

3736
02:09:12,319 --> 02:09:16,479
because this is expensive a lot of

3737
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:17,920
therapy time if it fades

3738
02:09:16,479 --> 02:09:19,919
you know if it's great results initially

3739
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:23,279
but then it fades after six months

3740
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:27,118
what's the point and what we showed

3741
02:09:23,279 --> 02:09:29,198
in phase two is that um

3742
02:09:27,118 --> 02:09:30,960
people keep getting better at the

3743
02:09:29,198 --> 02:09:32,960
two-month follow-up

3744
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:34,880
they're doing pretty well but at the 12

3745
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:36,719
month follow-up they're even better

3746
02:09:34,880 --> 02:09:38,239
so it's durable people have learned how

3747
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:39,520
to process trauma

3748
02:09:38,238 --> 02:09:41,279
they keep getting better so we've not

3749
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:42,639
reached that point in this phase three

3750
02:09:41,279 --> 02:09:43,679
study where everybody's got their one

3751
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:45,359
year follow-up but

3752
02:09:43,679 --> 02:09:47,199
we have also done three and a half year

3753
02:09:45,359 --> 02:09:48,719
follow-ups to some of the groups that

3754
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:50,879
were in phase two

3755
02:09:48,719 --> 02:09:51,840
and showed that it was durable and we're

3756
02:09:50,880 --> 02:09:54,000
doing a long

3757
02:09:51,840 --> 02:09:55,520
long-term follow-up now to everybody to

3758
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:57,599
many of the people in phase two some of

3759
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:59,280
them treated 15 years ago

3760
02:09:57,599 --> 02:10:00,719
so that's all more for the insurance

3761
02:09:59,279 --> 02:10:02,719
companies so

3762
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:04,319
basically what we found in the paper

3763
02:10:02,719 --> 02:10:06,800
that we just published is that it was

3764
02:10:04,319 --> 02:10:08,639
highly efficacious highly significant

3765
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:10,639
no effect by sight works in the hardest

3766
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:13,199
cases

3767
02:10:10,639 --> 02:10:14,560
and the safety record was great that's

3768
02:10:13,198 --> 02:10:17,198
an incredible success

3769
02:10:14,560 --> 02:10:18,800
and that's really exciting especially

3770
02:10:17,198 --> 02:10:20,319
given that uh the people who've

3771
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:22,960
committed

3772
02:10:20,319 --> 02:10:24,158
who attempted to commit suicide were let

3773
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:26,840
into the study and

3774
02:10:24,158 --> 02:10:28,158
so these are is the people who are truly

3775
02:10:26,840 --> 02:10:31,760
suffering

3776
02:10:28,158 --> 02:10:36,078
um i mean

3777
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:37,679
that um that's incredibly exciting

3778
02:10:36,078 --> 02:10:39,840
and i mean just to speak to the

3779
02:10:37,679 --> 02:10:42,000
frustration why things can't move faster

3780
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:44,800
but um

3781
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:45,599
but for what it is it's incredibly

3782
02:10:44,800 --> 02:10:48,079
exciting

3783
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:49,920
is there other studies of this nature

3784
02:10:48,078 --> 02:10:51,599
that you foresee

3785
02:10:49,920 --> 02:10:53,359
enabling that same kind of positive

3786
02:10:51,599 --> 02:10:55,279
impact whether it's mdma

3787
02:10:53,359 --> 02:10:57,198
for other things like treating addiction

3788
02:10:55,279 --> 02:10:59,679
or maybe it's psilocybin

3789
02:10:57,198 --> 02:11:01,198
for uh for other conditions is there

3790
02:10:59,679 --> 02:11:04,480
something else that's promising

3791
02:11:01,198 --> 02:11:07,359
yeah i i think that um

3792
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:08,879
what we've discovered i don't think is

3793
02:11:07,359 --> 02:11:12,319
unique to mdma

3794
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:15,840
so it's mdma assisted psychotherapy

3795
02:11:12,319 --> 02:11:18,000
mdma is ideal for ptsd you know

3796
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:19,199
maybe it won't work as well for ocd or

3797
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:21,439
other things you know it's very

3798
02:11:19,198 --> 02:11:23,598
strategic why we chose mdma and why we

3799
02:11:21,439 --> 02:11:25,678
chose ptsd

3800
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:26,880
but i i don't think that the results

3801
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:29,440
that we've got are so

3802
02:11:26,880 --> 02:11:31,359
unique to mdma assisted therapy i think

3803
02:11:29,439 --> 02:11:32,879
that psilocybin assisted therapy is

3804
02:11:31,359 --> 02:11:35,519
going to be great for

3805
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:36,078
people with life-threatening illnesses

3806
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:38,400
cancer

3807
02:11:36,078 --> 02:11:39,599
you know we're anxious about dying it's

3808
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:41,439
looks like it's really good in the

3809
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:45,119
treatment of addiction

3810
02:11:41,439 --> 02:11:47,279
um again these are in combination with

3811
02:11:45,118 --> 02:11:49,039
sort of the psilocybin tobacco was

3812
02:11:47,279 --> 02:11:50,319
cognitive behavioral therapy with

3813
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:52,880
psilocybin

3814
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:54,719
um i think that it's going to be a

3815
02:11:52,880 --> 02:11:55,599
little bit more difficult psilocybin for

3816
02:11:54,719 --> 02:11:57,920
depression

3817
02:11:55,599 --> 02:11:59,599
i don't know if it'll be quite as good

3818
02:11:57,920 --> 02:12:01,760
you know there are some biological

3819
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:03,039
aspects sometimes to depression

3820
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:04,880
but i think there'll be really good

3821
02:12:03,039 --> 02:12:06,560
results for psilocybin for depression i

3822
02:12:04,880 --> 02:12:09,039
think it'll be approved it's considered

3823
02:12:06,560 --> 02:12:11,760
a breakthrough therapy by the fda

3824
02:12:09,039 --> 02:12:13,359
ibogaine is phenomenal for opiate

3825
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:14,639
addiction helping people go through the

3826
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:16,639
withdrawal and then

3827
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:19,118
giving them this chance to deal with the

3828
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:21,199
material that they've

3829
02:12:19,118 --> 02:12:23,439
that drives them for addiction um there

3830
02:12:21,198 --> 02:12:26,319
was ben sessa dr ben sessa in england

3831
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:28,319
did mdma for alcohol use disorder

3832
02:12:26,319 --> 02:12:30,960
and that was really great the results he

3833
02:12:28,319 --> 02:12:32,639
got and it's it's the case that

3834
02:12:30,960 --> 02:12:34,880
he ended up basically treating people

3835
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:35,199
for trauma it's the trauma that people

3836
02:12:34,880 --> 02:12:37,199
run

3837
02:12:35,198 --> 02:12:39,198
the emotional challenges that people run

3838
02:12:37,198 --> 02:12:41,118
from into

3839
02:12:39,198 --> 02:12:42,879
quieting that pain through drug

3840
02:12:41,118 --> 02:12:45,039
addiction or alcoholism

3841
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:48,239
so trauma is behind a lot of addiction i

3842
02:12:45,039 --> 02:12:51,198
i think that we are going to see

3843
02:12:48,238 --> 02:12:54,000
a revolution in psychiatry and that

3844
02:12:51,198 --> 02:12:57,039
there will be a lot of

3845
02:12:54,000 --> 02:12:59,198
conditions that have

3846
02:12:57,039 --> 02:13:01,198
left a lot of people still suffering

3847
02:12:59,198 --> 02:13:02,479
that psychedelic assisted therapy

3848
02:13:01,198 --> 02:13:05,439
different psychedelics different

3849
02:13:02,479 --> 02:13:07,198
approaches but i think that we will see

3850
02:13:05,439 --> 02:13:08,719
a lot of hope for psychiatry and

3851
02:13:07,198 --> 02:13:10,638
psychotherapy and that psychedelics

3852
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:12,639
would be a big part of

3853
02:13:10,639 --> 02:13:14,880
changing the practice of of psychiatry

3854
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:18,078
and psychotherapy yeah this is really

3855
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:19,840
to me fascinating so i i actually um

3856
02:13:18,078 --> 02:13:21,840
when i was younger for the longest time

3857
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:24,800
wanted to be a psychiatrist

3858
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:25,760
so i was excited by psychotherapy but

3859
02:13:24,800 --> 02:13:27,440
then i

3860
02:13:25,760 --> 02:13:29,280
uh perhaps incorrectly maybe you can

3861
02:13:27,439 --> 02:13:31,039
correct me but

3862
02:13:29,279 --> 02:13:33,039
became more and more cynical because it

3863
02:13:31,039 --> 02:13:34,479
felt like it was more about prescribing

3864
02:13:33,039 --> 02:13:36,399
drugs than psychotherapy

3865
02:13:34,479 --> 02:13:38,319
i'm not going to correct you that's i

3866
02:13:36,399 --> 02:13:38,879
mean right now it's like there is a

3867
02:13:38,319 --> 02:13:40,799
crisis

3868
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:43,199
in psychiatry that there are so many

3869
02:13:40,800 --> 02:13:45,599
psychiatrists that are so fed up because

3870
02:13:43,198 --> 02:13:47,439
they have been pharmaceuticalized yes

3871
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:49,039
they meet people for 15 minutes they

3872
02:13:47,439 --> 02:13:50,879
adjust their medications

3873
02:13:49,039 --> 02:13:52,960
this is the way they make the most money

3874
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:53,440
yeah but they've lost the art of talking

3875
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:56,880
to people

3876
02:13:53,439 --> 02:13:57,198
yes it's it's true and that's why we see

3877
02:13:56,880 --> 02:14:00,000
that

3878
02:13:57,198 --> 02:14:01,118
so many young psychiatric residents are

3879
02:14:00,000 --> 02:14:03,760
so thrilled by

3880
02:14:01,118 --> 02:14:04,960
psychedelics that they really want to

3881
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:06,800
get back to

3882
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:08,319
treating people as individuals not just

3883
02:14:06,800 --> 02:14:09,920
a bunch of chemicals

3884
02:14:08,319 --> 02:14:11,759
yeah that's truly fascinating because

3885
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:12,960
the reason it was appealing to me it was

3886
02:14:11,760 --> 02:14:17,360
a way to

3887
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:20,639
to study the human mind and to see ways

3888
02:14:17,359 --> 02:14:24,078
through talking that you can

3889
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:25,679
make people feel better make people

3890
02:14:24,078 --> 02:14:28,880
better

3891
02:14:25,679 --> 02:14:30,399
you know make people suffer less and

3892
02:14:28,880 --> 02:14:32,560
that that was really exciting at the

3893
02:14:30,399 --> 02:14:34,799
time i ended up then going to ai

3894
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:37,280
because then i can understand the mind

3895
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:39,119
from that angle but um

3896
02:14:37,279 --> 02:14:41,840
it's exciting that that that could be

3897
02:14:39,118 --> 02:14:41,839
also

3898
02:14:42,000 --> 02:14:45,198
revolutionized the field of

3899
02:14:43,198 --> 02:14:48,078
psychotherapy take it from its

3900
02:14:45,198 --> 02:14:49,039
uh back to its origins to where um a

3901
02:14:48,078 --> 02:14:51,759
psychiatrist

3902
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:53,279
would be a scholar of the mind yeah well

3903
02:14:51,760 --> 02:14:54,960
you know freud talked about

3904
02:14:53,279 --> 02:14:56,319
dreams as the royal road to the

3905
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:58,960
unconscious

3906
02:14:56,319 --> 02:15:00,880
and there was a lot of we you you really

3907
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:04,239
spent a lot of time with people

3908
02:15:00,880 --> 02:15:06,319
now um right before he died um

3909
02:15:04,238 --> 02:15:08,158
in in his last book freud wrote

3910
02:15:06,319 --> 02:15:10,319
something and again this will be a

3911
02:15:08,158 --> 02:15:11,439
rough paraphrase but he said that in the

3912
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:15,039
future

3913
02:15:11,439 --> 02:15:15,598
we may learn about the energies of the

3914
02:15:15,039 --> 02:15:17,519
brain

3915
02:15:15,599 --> 02:15:19,199
and there'll be ways with chemicals to

3916
02:15:17,520 --> 02:15:22,990
influence that that will

3917
02:15:19,198 --> 02:15:24,399
help the therapeutic process yeah

3918
02:15:22,989 --> 02:15:26,960
[Laughter]

3919
02:15:24,399 --> 02:15:27,759
so you could say he was uh he was ahead

3920
02:15:26,960 --> 02:15:30,639
of his time

3921
02:15:27,760 --> 02:15:31,280
yeah this study paints a fascinating

3922
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:34,960
picture

3923
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:37,840
of a future where first for medical

3924
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:39,520
applications but then also in general

3925
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:42,239
psychedelics of various forms could be

3926
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:44,480
used by the broader society

3927
02:15:42,238 --> 02:15:46,000
forgive the perhaps ridiculous question

3928
02:15:44,479 --> 02:15:48,839
but

3929
02:15:46,000 --> 02:15:50,319
if much of society including our

3930
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:53,760
politicians are

3931
02:15:50,319 --> 02:15:56,799
um taking psychedelics

3932
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:58,639
and dissolving their ego and going

3933
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:01,360
through this whole process

3934
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:01,920
how how do you think the world may look

3935
02:16:01,359 --> 02:16:04,960
different

3936
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:08,078
in 20 30 50 years ah

3937
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:11,039
okay so um i i said that i think

3938
02:16:08,078 --> 02:16:11,439
licensed legalization happens in 2035

3939
02:16:11,039 --> 02:16:14,960
yes

3940
02:16:11,439 --> 02:16:18,238
right so um and i think by 2050

3941
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:22,000
um we will have enough people

3942
02:16:18,238 --> 02:16:25,279
hopefully spiritualized

3943
02:16:22,000 --> 02:16:26,479
we're also talking about um we hear so

3944
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:28,800
much in terms of

3945
02:16:26,479 --> 02:16:29,919
climate change about you know net zero

3946
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:32,960
carbon

3947
02:16:29,920 --> 02:16:34,960
so our goal is net zero trauma

3948
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:37,199
when do we have a world with net zero

3949
02:16:34,959 --> 02:16:39,919
trauma i mean right now

3950
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:42,000
you know we have two sites in israel so

3951
02:16:39,920 --> 02:16:43,760
we help a few people but the recent war

3952
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:45,679
with gaza

3953
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:46,800
has traumatized millions of people on

3954
02:16:45,679 --> 02:16:50,079
both sides

3955
02:16:46,799 --> 02:16:51,438
so we are a long way away from net zero

3956
02:16:50,079 --> 02:16:54,959
trauma

3957
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:57,920
um but that's the hope and that's

3958
02:16:54,959 --> 02:16:59,119
i think possible i think humanity as a

3959
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:02,239
whole

3960
02:16:59,120 --> 02:17:04,960
um is

3961
02:17:02,239 --> 02:17:07,280
like lemmings heading over a cliff with

3962
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:10,398
climate change and with

3963
02:17:07,280 --> 02:17:12,319
the nuclear proliferation and just the

3964
02:17:10,398 --> 02:17:14,000
the religious hatreds and the more the

3965
02:17:12,318 --> 02:17:14,959
retreat to authoritarianism and

3966
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:18,879
fundamentalism

3967
02:17:14,959 --> 02:17:20,718
and tribalism so i i think that there's

3968
02:17:18,879 --> 02:17:23,199
a very good chance though that

3969
02:17:20,718 --> 02:17:24,638
psychedelics used wisely so it's not

3970
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:26,079
just makes psychedelics

3971
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:27,759
legal and everybody takes them and you

3972
02:17:26,079 --> 02:17:28,558
know as you talked about ted kaczynski

3973
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:31,120
you know

3974
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:32,398
it's the context that people take it in

3975
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:36,160
but i think that there's

3976
02:17:32,398 --> 02:17:39,199
um a reasonable chance that enough

3977
02:17:36,159 --> 02:17:42,318
people can sort of you could say

3978
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:46,719
um clean their filters uh

3979
02:17:42,318 --> 02:17:48,718
to see people as um

3980
02:17:46,718 --> 02:17:50,318
more similar to them than different not

3981
02:17:48,718 --> 02:17:52,000
to label them as the enemy

3982
02:17:50,318 --> 02:17:54,079
stan groff again had this beautiful

3983
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:57,439
phrase about um

3984
02:17:54,079 --> 02:17:59,679
transparent to the transcendent

3985
02:17:57,439 --> 02:18:01,840
the death that's what yeah so for our

3986
02:17:59,679 --> 02:18:02,799
ego can can we be transparent to the

3987
02:18:01,840 --> 02:18:04,558
transcendent because

3988
02:18:02,799 --> 02:18:07,199
can the filter that we look through the

3989
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:09,119
world at be cleaned

3990
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:10,319
to um you could say cleansing the doors

3991
02:18:09,120 --> 02:18:11,920
of perception you know

3992
02:18:10,318 --> 02:18:14,398
can it be clean to the point where we

3993
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:17,599
can see the humanity in everybody

3994
02:18:14,398 --> 02:18:19,840
and see that um

3995
02:18:17,599 --> 02:18:21,599
one way to say this is that can we get

3996
02:18:19,840 --> 02:18:23,120
to the point where religions are seen as

3997
02:18:21,599 --> 02:18:25,120
like languages

3998
02:18:23,120 --> 02:18:26,240
where we all have this need to

3999
02:18:25,120 --> 02:18:28,240
communicate there's

4000
02:18:26,239 --> 02:18:30,239
thousands of different languages you

4001
02:18:28,239 --> 02:18:32,079
know we don't say that this language is

4002
02:18:30,239 --> 02:18:33,519
fundamentally better than this language

4003
02:18:32,079 --> 02:18:35,439
this language is the only right language

4004
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:37,200
everybody must speak english and

4005
02:18:35,439 --> 02:18:39,679
russian is bad or german is better you

4006
02:18:37,200 --> 02:18:41,359
know maybe we'll get to that point that

4007
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:42,960
that religions are like that that their

4008
02:18:41,359 --> 02:18:44,960
different cultural backgrounds different

4009
02:18:42,959 --> 02:18:46,799
symbol systems different um

4010
02:18:44,959 --> 02:18:48,318
saints and heroes and messiahs and all

4011
02:18:46,799 --> 02:18:49,920
this but that

4012
02:18:48,318 --> 02:18:52,239
you know yeah jesus is the son of god

4013
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:54,000
but so are we so is everybody you know

4014
02:18:52,239 --> 02:18:55,840
or yes you know the jews are the chosen

4015
02:18:54,000 --> 02:18:59,359
people but so is everybody

4016
02:18:55,840 --> 02:19:01,519
so can we get there i think that we can

4017
02:18:59,359 --> 02:19:03,840
and i think that we need to to survive

4018
02:19:01,519 --> 02:19:07,280
the challenges that we're facing

4019
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:10,239
and the hope is that by bringing

4020
02:19:07,280 --> 02:19:11,280
psychedelics as tools forward and trying

4021
02:19:10,239 --> 02:19:14,638
to bring

4022
02:19:11,280 --> 02:19:16,880
the context around them to be one of

4023
02:19:14,638 --> 02:19:18,478
responsibility rather than just profit

4024
02:19:16,879 --> 02:19:20,159
maximization

4025
02:19:18,478 --> 02:19:21,679
and just you know get as many people to

4026
02:19:20,159 --> 02:19:22,879
do them from all these for-profit

4027
02:19:21,679 --> 02:19:25,760
companies

4028
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:27,279
you know can we and then also drug

4029
02:19:25,760 --> 02:19:28,880
policy reform and embed

4030
02:19:27,280 --> 02:19:30,639
knowledge in the society can we get to

4031
02:19:28,879 --> 02:19:33,438
honest drug education

4032
02:19:30,638 --> 02:19:35,279
you know dare the drug awareness

4033
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:37,519
resistance

4034
02:19:35,280 --> 02:19:38,960
education you know is fundamentally

4035
02:19:37,519 --> 02:19:40,478
twisted i mean

4036
02:19:38,959 --> 02:19:42,638
but it's the program that's used in a

4037
02:19:40,478 --> 02:19:44,799
lot of schools now

4038
02:19:42,638 --> 02:19:46,959
so can we get honest drug education pure

4039
02:19:44,799 --> 02:19:49,679
drugs harm reduction

4040
02:19:46,959 --> 02:19:50,719
and knowledge about therapeutic uses and

4041
02:19:49,680 --> 02:19:52,479
um

4042
02:19:50,719 --> 02:19:54,559
on the one hand and and more of these

4043
02:19:52,478 --> 02:19:58,079
thousands of psychedelic clinics

4044
02:19:54,559 --> 02:19:59,039
um i'm hopeful um and that that's our

4045
02:19:58,079 --> 02:20:02,478
goal

4046
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:04,800
but in this landscape of um

4047
02:20:02,478 --> 02:20:05,840
pharma companies they make a lot of

4048
02:20:04,799 --> 02:20:07,679
money

4049
02:20:05,840 --> 02:20:09,040
some people are worried about the impact

4050
02:20:07,680 --> 02:20:11,920
of those com you know

4051
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:12,960
uh a big pharma on the landscape of

4052
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:15,680
human trauma

4053
02:20:12,959 --> 02:20:17,438
yeah yeah and so there's of course some

4054
02:20:15,680 --> 02:20:22,239
companies could do good

4055
02:20:17,439 --> 02:20:23,680
but that's not inherent like um

4056
02:20:22,239 --> 02:20:25,520
many of these companies are not

4057
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:26,880
optimizing for good they're optimizing

4058
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:29,840
from profit exactly

4059
02:20:26,879 --> 02:20:31,759
exactly does this uh rise of for-profit

4060
02:20:29,840 --> 02:20:34,478
pharma companies were eu

4061
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:35,920
how do you navigate it do we still have

4062
02:20:34,478 --> 02:20:39,599
for-profit companies that

4063
02:20:35,920 --> 02:20:40,478
basically uh do what uh maps does which

4064
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:42,000
is like

4065
02:20:40,478 --> 02:20:44,318
fight the good fight for the benefit of

4066
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:47,120
humanity like what like how do we

4067
02:20:44,318 --> 02:20:49,519
proceed in this in landscape or work

4068
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:53,280
where drugs can make a lot of money

4069
02:20:49,520 --> 02:20:55,040
well i am concerned overall i think the

4070
02:20:53,280 --> 02:20:57,120
rise of the for-profit

4071
02:20:55,040 --> 02:20:58,640
companies we have to realize is a sign

4072
02:20:57,120 --> 02:21:01,680
of success

4073
02:20:58,639 --> 02:21:04,639
that we have overcome

4074
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:05,359
the regulatory prohibitions we've

4075
02:21:04,639 --> 02:21:06,799
overcome

4076
02:21:05,359 --> 02:21:09,200
a lot of the public attitudes that are

4077
02:21:06,799 --> 02:21:10,959
against it we've demonstrated some

4078
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:12,079
success so the rise of the for-profit

4079
02:21:10,959 --> 02:21:13,599
companies

4080
02:21:12,079 --> 02:21:15,600
are a sign of the progress that we've

4081
02:21:13,600 --> 02:21:19,040
made on the other hand turning things

4082
02:21:15,600 --> 02:21:20,720
over to profit maximizing companies

4083
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:22,319
the big concern is that they're going to

4084
02:21:20,719 --> 02:21:25,279
try to

4085
02:21:22,318 --> 02:21:26,159
minimize the amount of therapy and make

4086
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:27,840
it so the cost

4087
02:21:26,159 --> 02:21:29,520
is less so insurance companies are more

4088
02:21:27,840 --> 02:21:32,079
likely to cover it and then that they

4089
02:21:29,520 --> 02:21:34,000
just sell the most drugs

4090
02:21:32,079 --> 02:21:35,359
the other thing we've seen as an example

4091
02:21:34,000 --> 02:21:37,120
of this is s

4092
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:38,960
ketamine by johnson johnson for

4093
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:40,560
depression and it's done by a profit

4094
02:21:38,959 --> 02:21:41,519
maximizing company

4095
02:21:40,559 --> 02:21:43,199
they don't know anything about

4096
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:44,800
psychedelic psychotherapy or

4097
02:21:43,200 --> 02:21:47,680
psychotherapy at all

4098
02:21:44,799 --> 02:21:49,759
and so they've gotten approval for

4099
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:51,920
s-ketamine on the basis of it's just a

4100
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:55,040
pharmacological treatment

4101
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:57,040
and it's not delivered with therapy the

4102
02:21:55,040 --> 02:22:00,160
results fade pretty quickly

4103
02:21:57,040 --> 02:22:00,560
so you need to get more ketamine and so

4104
02:22:00,159 --> 02:22:02,239
it's

4105
02:22:00,559 --> 02:22:03,920
designed in a way to maximize the

4106
02:22:02,239 --> 02:22:05,520
profits for the

4107
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:07,680
pharmaceutical company but it doesn't

4108
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:09,280
maximize patient outcomes

4109
02:22:07,680 --> 02:22:11,520
what we're seeing though in these

4110
02:22:09,280 --> 02:22:14,079
various clinics that are being set up is

4111
02:22:11,520 --> 02:22:17,520
that a lot of people are realizing

4112
02:22:14,079 --> 02:22:19,680
that it works better with therapy

4113
02:22:17,520 --> 02:22:22,000
and so the clinics are run by people

4114
02:22:19,680 --> 02:22:23,600
that are therapists so that when they

4115
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:25,280
provide therapy they're making more

4116
02:22:23,600 --> 02:22:26,479
money and and then you need less

4117
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:30,399
ketamine

4118
02:22:26,478 --> 02:22:32,318
also ketamine itself s ketamine is a

4119
02:22:30,398 --> 02:22:33,439
isomer of ketamine that's been patented

4120
02:22:32,318 --> 02:22:34,959
for depression

4121
02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:37,120
and they sell it for hundreds of dollars

4122
02:22:34,959 --> 02:22:38,639
but ketamine itself

4123
02:22:37,120 --> 02:22:40,479
is one of the world's essential

4124
02:22:38,639 --> 02:22:42,079
medicines it's off patent it's been

4125
02:22:40,478 --> 02:22:44,478
around for a long time it was the main

4126
02:22:42,079 --> 02:22:46,318
battlefield anaesthetic in vietnam

4127
02:22:44,478 --> 02:22:47,599
and it's only a few bucks because it's

4128
02:22:46,318 --> 02:22:49,760
generic so

4129
02:22:47,600 --> 02:22:50,880
a lot of the ketamine clinics are saying

4130
02:22:49,760 --> 02:22:52,159
great thank you

4131
02:22:50,879 --> 02:22:54,079
johnson johnson you've helped

4132
02:22:52,159 --> 02:22:55,439
demonstrate that ketamine is good for

4133
02:22:54,079 --> 02:22:56,159
depression but we're not going to buy it

4134
02:22:55,439 --> 02:22:57,920
from you

4135
02:22:56,159 --> 02:23:00,559
we're going to buy it for a few bucks

4136
02:22:57,920 --> 02:23:02,159
and we're going to add therapy to it

4137
02:23:00,559 --> 02:23:03,680
now there's a bunch of ketamine mills

4138
02:23:02,159 --> 02:23:05,359
you could say that are that are

4139
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,040
just prescribing the ketamine and then

4140
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:09,840
people are making a lot of money there

4141
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:11,280
so i am worried about that i think the

4142
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:15,520
best thing that we can do

4143
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:17,439
is create an alternative narrative

4144
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:18,720
a different kind of example we can lead

4145
02:23:17,439 --> 02:23:20,800
by example we can't make

4146
02:23:18,719 --> 02:23:22,318
for-profit companies into benefit

4147
02:23:20,799 --> 02:23:23,920
corporations

4148
02:23:22,318 --> 02:23:26,719
unless they want to do that we can't

4149
02:23:23,920 --> 02:23:29,040
make them to you know really

4150
02:23:26,719 --> 02:23:30,398
maximize patient outcomes but if we

4151
02:23:29,040 --> 02:23:32,960
create an example

4152
02:23:30,398 --> 02:23:33,680
of something that's different the hope

4153
02:23:32,959 --> 02:23:36,000
is that

4154
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:37,280
um people will gravitate towards that

4155
02:23:36,000 --> 02:23:39,200
and some of the other

4156
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:41,120
companies like even now we have exxon

4157
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:42,880
and other these uh companies

4158
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:44,880
oil companies saying oh we're big into

4159
02:23:42,879 --> 02:23:47,119
alternative energy and we're

4160
02:23:44,879 --> 02:23:49,519
you know and that starts with companies

4161
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:51,120
that show an example that uh

4162
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:53,520
then communicates to the public that

4163
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:54,319
this is something exciting and then they

4164
02:23:53,520 --> 02:23:56,640
demand of

4165
02:23:54,318 --> 02:23:57,680
the same of exxon and so on the public

4166
02:23:56,639 --> 02:24:00,000
demands and

4167
02:23:57,680 --> 02:24:01,760
you could say the same thing for the

4168
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:04,959
public demanding the

4169
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:07,680
the big pharma to uh to

4170
02:24:04,959 --> 02:24:08,239
optimize for benefit versus optimize for

4171
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:11,040
profit

4172
02:24:08,239 --> 02:24:12,799
and maybe giving power to the therapists

4173
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:14,800
more power to the therapist more power

4174
02:24:12,799 --> 02:24:18,719
to the doctors that ultimately

4175
02:24:14,799 --> 02:24:18,719
uh want i think

4176
02:24:19,680 --> 02:24:24,079
incentives are interesting but i think

4177
02:24:21,760 --> 02:24:26,000
doctors ultimately

4178
02:24:24,079 --> 02:24:27,280
care more because they're in direct

4179
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,760
contact with humans

4180
02:24:27,280 --> 02:24:31,280
they want to make people better it's not

4181
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:33,120
you know sure they want to make money

4182
02:24:31,280 --> 02:24:35,040
but they ultimately want to make people

4183
02:24:33,120 --> 02:24:36,800
feel better because they get to look at

4184
02:24:35,040 --> 02:24:38,720
people and it's so joyful

4185
02:24:36,799 --> 02:24:41,599
to make people feel better at the end of

4186
02:24:38,719 --> 02:24:44,398
the day so giving more power to them

4187
02:24:41,600 --> 02:24:46,318
is also perhaps one of the ways that you

4188
02:24:44,398 --> 02:24:49,760
then incentivize

4189
02:24:46,318 --> 02:24:52,398
uh the the pharma companies that are

4190
02:24:49,760 --> 02:24:53,760
trying to do good because the doctors

4191
02:24:52,398 --> 02:24:55,519
will choose those companies

4192
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:56,880
yeah now the other part of this is drug

4193
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:59,040
policy reform

4194
02:24:56,879 --> 02:25:01,438
right so that if we make it so you can

4195
02:24:59,040 --> 02:25:05,040
buy mdma for 10 or 20 bucks

4196
02:25:01,439 --> 02:25:06,479
on your own and we've trained people on

4197
02:25:05,040 --> 02:25:10,319
here's our therapeutic method

4198
02:25:06,478 --> 02:25:12,879
here is our ways for peer support

4199
02:25:10,318 --> 02:25:15,039
then people have an alternative from

4200
02:25:12,879 --> 02:25:18,398
buying it from the pharma companies

4201
02:25:15,040 --> 02:25:22,240
so most of the for-profit companies

4202
02:25:18,398 --> 02:25:23,840
have come to this conclusion that um

4203
02:25:22,239 --> 02:25:25,520
drug policy reform is bad for their

4204
02:25:23,840 --> 02:25:27,439
business model

4205
02:25:25,520 --> 02:25:30,399
i think they're making a fundamental

4206
02:25:27,439 --> 02:25:32,398
mistake and i think the reason is that

4207
02:25:30,398 --> 02:25:34,239
the more that we destigmatize this the

4208
02:25:32,398 --> 02:25:35,760
more that we sensitize people to this is

4209
02:25:34,239 --> 02:25:37,840
an approach

4210
02:25:35,760 --> 02:25:39,600
even when people can get it on their own

4211
02:25:37,840 --> 02:25:40,639
and do it with their friends or do it

4212
02:25:39,600 --> 02:25:42,159
with themselves

4213
02:25:40,639 --> 02:25:43,920
there's going to be even more people

4214
02:25:42,159 --> 02:25:46,159
that say oh my god i've got real

4215
02:25:43,920 --> 02:25:47,760
serious issues i would rather go to

4216
02:25:46,159 --> 02:25:50,799
trained professionals

4217
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:54,000
covered by insurance and i think it'll

4218
02:25:50,799 --> 02:25:55,438
increase the business but most

4219
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:57,040
of the for-profit companies don't see it

4220
02:25:55,439 --> 02:26:00,720
that way and so

4221
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:02,560
as a non-profit that owns a benefit corp

4222
02:26:00,719 --> 02:26:03,840
we're not trying to maximize sales or

4223
02:26:02,559 --> 02:26:06,239
profits so that

4224
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:08,880
but but i do believe that drug policy

4225
02:26:06,239 --> 02:26:10,559
reform creates this alternative

4226
02:26:08,879 --> 02:26:12,719
access point for people and that will

4227
02:26:10,559 --> 02:26:15,760
help keep the for-profits in check

4228
02:26:12,719 --> 02:26:19,119
to some extent as well

4229
02:26:15,760 --> 02:26:20,239
i love it uh is there um let's put on

4230
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:24,319
your

4231
02:26:20,239 --> 02:26:26,239
wise visionary hat and ask

4232
02:26:24,318 --> 02:26:27,840
when you look to young folks is there

4233
02:26:26,239 --> 02:26:29,520
advice you can give

4234
02:26:27,840 --> 02:26:31,439
to young people today whether in high

4235
02:26:29,520 --> 02:26:34,560
school or college

4236
02:26:31,439 --> 02:26:36,800
about career about life

4237
02:26:34,559 --> 02:26:38,879
you've lived quite a non-linear and

4238
02:26:36,799 --> 02:26:40,639
fascinating life yourself

4239
02:26:38,879 --> 02:26:43,759
is there advice you can give either on

4240
02:26:40,639 --> 02:26:46,639
career or more generally in life

4241
02:26:43,760 --> 02:26:50,719
well i i would say what what people

4242
02:26:46,639 --> 02:26:52,559
often hear is that um

4243
02:26:50,719 --> 02:26:55,199
you know we're not actually here for

4244
02:26:52,559 --> 02:26:58,639
that long a period of time

4245
02:26:55,200 --> 02:26:59,600
um and so to the a and the world is on

4246
02:26:58,639 --> 02:27:02,318
fire

4247
02:26:59,600 --> 02:27:02,960
and whether humanity survives is not

4248
02:27:02,318 --> 02:27:05,279
clear

4249
02:27:02,959 --> 02:27:06,799
and whether how many species are we

4250
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:08,399
going to kill before we figure out not

4251
02:27:06,799 --> 02:27:11,599
to do that anymore

4252
02:27:08,398 --> 02:27:14,318
so i would advise you to really

4253
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:14,318
try to

4254
02:27:15,040 --> 02:27:18,560
develop a combination of what do you

4255
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:20,639
need in terms of

4256
02:27:18,559 --> 02:27:23,279
income for your own survival but what

4257
02:27:20,639 --> 02:27:27,519
does the world need in terms of

4258
02:27:23,280 --> 02:27:30,319
um help to make the world better

4259
02:27:27,520 --> 02:27:31,200
and you know howard thurman who he

4260
02:27:30,318 --> 02:27:33,039
talked about who

4261
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:34,399
who ran the good friday experiment the

4262
02:27:33,040 --> 02:27:36,080
minister there he said

4263
02:27:34,398 --> 02:27:38,478
he's got a famous quote attributed to

4264
02:27:36,079 --> 02:27:40,079
him he says um

4265
02:27:38,478 --> 02:27:41,599
and this is exactly it to young people

4266
02:27:40,079 --> 02:27:43,120
he said um

4267
02:27:41,600 --> 02:27:45,359
you know there's nothing particular that

4268
02:27:43,120 --> 02:27:47,520
you should do but find what makes you

4269
02:27:45,359 --> 02:27:49,840
come alive because what the world needs

4270
02:27:47,520 --> 02:27:52,319
is people that have come alive and are

4271
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:56,478
passionate

4272
02:27:52,318 --> 02:27:56,478
so i i would say that

4273
02:27:56,879 --> 02:28:03,679
beware of this uh

4274
02:28:00,079 --> 02:28:05,760
trap that you need um vast resources

4275
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:08,159
that you need all this stuff

4276
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:09,280
you know uh you know i i keep thinking

4277
02:28:08,159 --> 02:28:11,280
of the

4278
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:12,880
super wealthy people in first class on

4279
02:28:11,280 --> 02:28:14,960
the titanic

4280
02:28:12,879 --> 02:28:16,559
you know as the titanic is sinking you

4281
02:28:14,959 --> 02:28:16,959
know their money's not going to help

4282
02:28:16,559 --> 02:28:19,039
them

4283
02:28:16,959 --> 02:28:20,799
the the earth is like titanic you know

4284
02:28:19,040 --> 02:28:23,040
we're sinking we're destroying the

4285
02:28:20,799 --> 02:28:24,639
planets destroying the environment so

4286
02:28:23,040 --> 02:28:27,120
it's um you need a certain amount of

4287
02:28:24,639 --> 02:28:29,358
money to be comfortable

4288
02:28:27,120 --> 02:28:30,479
to not be at that edge of survival

4289
02:28:29,359 --> 02:28:31,520
because once you're at that edge of

4290
02:28:30,478 --> 02:28:33,519
survival it's hard to think about

4291
02:28:31,520 --> 02:28:35,840
anything else but but i'd say to young

4292
02:28:33,520 --> 02:28:35,840
people

4293
02:28:36,799 --> 02:28:40,719
to the extent that you're able to do

4294
02:28:38,639 --> 02:28:42,639
this and again student debt and all this

4295
02:28:40,719 --> 02:28:46,398
kind of stuff is a big problem there too

4296
02:28:42,639 --> 02:28:46,398
but really just try to

4297
02:28:47,359 --> 02:28:51,200
find this combination of what the world

4298
02:28:48,959 --> 02:28:54,239
needs and what you need the other thing

4299
02:28:51,200 --> 02:28:56,640
to say to young people is um life is a

4300
02:28:54,239 --> 02:28:59,439
lot shorter than you think

4301
02:28:56,639 --> 02:29:00,318
that and a 20-year plan is not really

4302
02:28:59,439 --> 02:29:02,559
that long

4303
02:29:00,318 --> 02:29:06,000
so if it takes you 20 years to get in a

4304
02:29:02,559 --> 02:29:08,719
position to do what you want to do

4305
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:09,600
go for it you know have long-term plans

4306
02:29:08,719 --> 02:29:12,879
the the other part

4307
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:14,239
that was so important for me to um

4308
02:29:12,879 --> 02:29:16,000
keep doing what i've been doing

4309
02:29:14,239 --> 02:29:17,920
basically now it's

4310
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:19,680
um 49 years that i've sort of been

4311
02:29:17,920 --> 02:29:21,520
devoting my life on psychedelics since i

4312
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:22,880
was 18.

4313
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:24,479
when i started i didn't think it would

4314
02:29:22,879 --> 02:29:26,879
ever work i just thought this is the

4315
02:29:24,478 --> 02:29:29,199
only idea i have in this crazy world

4316
02:29:26,879 --> 02:29:30,879
you know this is what i want to work on

4317
02:29:29,200 --> 02:29:33,040
luckily i had support from my family

4318
02:29:30,879 --> 02:29:36,639
that took care of my survival needs

4319
02:29:33,040 --> 02:29:37,200
so i could do that but i realized that

4320
02:29:36,639 --> 02:29:39,039
if my

4321
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:40,800
happiness was dependent upon

4322
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:43,680
accomplishments

4323
02:29:40,799 --> 02:29:44,559
that i might never be happy that i was

4324
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:49,120
able to

4325
02:29:44,559 --> 02:29:51,840
reframe happiness in terms of effort

4326
02:29:49,120 --> 02:29:52,800
yeah so if i'm trying hard to get stuff

4327
02:29:51,840 --> 02:29:55,439
um

4328
02:29:52,799 --> 02:29:57,358
to be better whether it's better or not

4329
02:29:55,439 --> 02:30:00,318
i can be happy at the end of each day

4330
02:29:57,359 --> 02:30:01,520
i tried and so i think you you try to

4331
02:30:00,318 --> 02:30:03,199
separate out

4332
02:30:01,520 --> 02:30:06,880
the goals that you have and your

4333
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:09,840
happiness to whether you're trying hard

4334
02:30:06,879 --> 02:30:10,799
the other thing i would say is that

4335
02:30:09,840 --> 02:30:13,439
everybody has

4336
02:30:10,799 --> 02:30:15,279
this humanity within them so be very

4337
02:30:13,439 --> 02:30:16,840
careful about dividing the world into us

4338
02:30:15,280 --> 02:30:20,479
and them

4339
02:30:16,840 --> 02:30:22,239
um you know and try to

4340
02:30:20,478 --> 02:30:23,679
so so one of the things that i've done

4341
02:30:22,239 --> 02:30:28,159
um

4342
02:30:23,680 --> 02:30:30,479
that has um taken a long time because

4343
02:30:28,159 --> 02:30:32,079
you know i feel like um you know drugs

4344
02:30:30,478 --> 02:30:33,920
are illegal i always felt like you know

4345
02:30:32,079 --> 02:30:34,959
the police were the predator and i'm the

4346
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:37,520
prey

4347
02:30:34,959 --> 02:30:38,799
yes you know but now we're working with

4348
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:40,560
the police and the police have

4349
02:30:38,799 --> 02:30:41,039
tremendous trauma from the work that

4350
02:30:40,559 --> 02:30:43,119
they do

4351
02:30:41,040 --> 02:30:45,200
we have one police officer who is now

4352
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:48,079
going he's a full-time police officer

4353
02:30:45,200 --> 02:30:50,000
he's also a psychotherapist and he's

4354
02:30:48,079 --> 02:30:51,840
going through our training program

4355
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:53,840
to learn how to give mdma therapy to

4356
02:30:51,840 --> 02:30:56,318
other police officers

4357
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:58,398
and i met his police chief a couple

4358
02:30:56,318 --> 02:31:00,239
times he got permission from his police

4359
02:30:58,398 --> 02:31:02,159
chief to go to the second part of our

4360
02:31:00,239 --> 02:31:05,280
training program which is where we give

4361
02:31:02,159 --> 02:31:06,239
mdma to therapists who volunteer as a

4362
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:08,800
patient

4363
02:31:06,239 --> 02:31:10,559
so we have just a couple weeks ago dosed

4364
02:31:08,799 --> 02:31:13,358
the police with mdma

4365
02:31:10,559 --> 02:31:16,000
yeah and so i think this idea of those

4366
02:31:13,359 --> 02:31:18,880
people that are on the quote other side

4367
02:31:16,000 --> 02:31:19,680
try to see through that to their

4368
02:31:18,879 --> 02:31:21,358
humanity

4369
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:23,520
to what their pains and suffering what

4370
02:31:21,359 --> 02:31:24,880
their struggles are to the extent that

4371
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:27,680
you can

4372
02:31:24,879 --> 02:31:28,719
and that i think and and build long-term

4373
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:31,439
relationships you

4374
02:31:28,719 --> 02:31:33,358
you never know what's gonna um come

4375
02:31:31,439 --> 02:31:34,639
around 20 years from now so you you help

4376
02:31:33,359 --> 02:31:36,318
some people try to keep these

4377
02:31:34,639 --> 02:31:37,519
relationships going 20 years from now

4378
02:31:36,318 --> 02:31:40,799
something could

4379
02:31:37,520 --> 02:31:44,800
could come and um and

4380
02:31:40,799 --> 02:31:48,398
also um be persistent

4381
02:31:44,799 --> 02:31:50,079
you know yeah i think that's

4382
02:31:48,398 --> 02:31:52,559
that's been the key to success i mean

4383
02:31:50,079 --> 02:31:54,159
once the fda or dea figured out

4384
02:31:52,559 --> 02:31:55,840
we're not going anywhere they're gonna

4385
02:31:54,159 --> 02:31:57,760
have to deal with us

4386
02:31:55,840 --> 02:32:00,318
then we started getting some progress

4387
02:31:57,760 --> 02:32:03,280
it's a mix of patience and stubbornness

4388
02:32:00,318 --> 02:32:03,920
that gets things done is there something

4389
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:07,120
you've

4390
02:32:03,920 --> 02:32:08,398
figured out through your journey with

4391
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:10,399
psychedelics

4392
02:32:08,398 --> 02:32:11,840
about some of the big why questions

4393
02:32:10,398 --> 02:32:14,959
about life

4394
02:32:11,840 --> 02:32:16,799
like oh like what the heck's the value

4395
02:32:14,959 --> 02:32:21,679
of love

4396
02:32:16,799 --> 02:32:24,719
um why does it suck so much that we die

4397
02:32:21,680 --> 02:32:26,000
and uh and for some of us maybe it's the

4398
02:32:24,719 --> 02:32:28,398
russian and me but it's

4399
02:32:26,000 --> 02:32:30,159
quite terrifying the notion of it or the

4400
02:32:28,398 --> 02:32:31,519
biggest why question of them all which

4401
02:32:30,159 --> 02:32:34,799
is what's the meaning

4402
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:37,280
of it all well um yeah what i've

4403
02:32:34,799 --> 02:32:40,079
discovered is that um

4404
02:32:37,280 --> 02:32:40,720
we don't need answers to those questions

4405
02:32:40,079 --> 02:32:44,239
you know

4406
02:32:40,719 --> 02:32:47,039
that the fact that um

4407
02:32:44,239 --> 02:32:48,398
we can feel happy you know that we can

4408
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:51,680
love that we can have

4409
02:32:48,398 --> 02:32:53,680
moments of happiness that's enough

4410
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:56,079
you know figuring out these big

4411
02:32:53,680 --> 02:32:58,318
questions you can get lost in that

4412
02:32:56,079 --> 02:33:00,239
and um you we all can come up with our

4413
02:32:58,318 --> 02:33:00,879
answers what's what's the meaning of

4414
02:33:00,239 --> 02:33:02,159
life why

4415
02:33:00,879 --> 02:33:04,318
why is there life why is there

4416
02:33:02,159 --> 02:33:06,159
consciousness but um

4417
02:33:04,318 --> 02:33:08,559
i don't know that we need those answers

4418
02:33:06,159 --> 02:33:11,680
what we know is that we're um

4419
02:33:08,559 --> 02:33:13,840
social creatures that um

4420
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:15,280
we people other people can make us happy

4421
02:33:13,840 --> 02:33:16,318
by certain things we can make other

4422
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:18,479
people happy

4423
02:33:16,318 --> 02:33:19,519
that one life is enough so this other

4424
02:33:18,478 --> 02:33:22,799
part about uh

4425
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:24,399
why is it so um tragic that we die yeah

4426
02:33:22,799 --> 02:33:26,719
um i i don't think it's tragic that we

4427
02:33:24,398 --> 02:33:30,159
die so first off if you believe in this

4428
02:33:26,719 --> 02:33:33,279
collective unconscious but but but

4429
02:33:30,159 --> 02:33:34,318
we have an impact that lasts but i i

4430
02:33:33,280 --> 02:33:36,560
think that

4431
02:33:34,318 --> 02:33:38,239
for me at least i've been of the view

4432
02:33:36,559 --> 02:33:40,959
that um

4433
02:33:38,239 --> 02:33:42,559
we should be grateful for death that

4434
02:33:40,959 --> 02:33:44,398
death makes life precious

4435
02:33:42,559 --> 02:33:45,760
that if we had an infinite amount of

4436
02:33:44,398 --> 02:33:47,439
time

4437
02:33:45,760 --> 02:33:49,120
you know i mean i'm i'm a bit of a

4438
02:33:47,439 --> 02:33:51,200
procrastinator about stuff

4439
02:33:49,120 --> 02:33:53,040
particularly things that are really you

4440
02:33:51,200 --> 02:33:54,560
know hard to do and you just you know

4441
02:33:53,040 --> 02:33:56,000
you just don't do it and then like

4442
02:33:54,559 --> 02:33:56,879
where'd the day go i was gonna do that

4443
02:33:56,000 --> 02:33:58,719
so

4444
02:33:56,879 --> 02:34:03,279
so if we had an infinite life we never

4445
02:33:58,719 --> 02:34:06,398
died um know would life be precious

4446
02:34:03,280 --> 02:34:09,680
would we do anything i don't think so so

4447
02:34:06,398 --> 02:34:11,119
my parents um gave um

4448
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:12,559
you know every jewish new year they

4449
02:34:11,120 --> 02:34:13,840
would they would make their uh new

4450
02:34:12,559 --> 02:34:16,239
year's card

4451
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:17,600
and and one of the quotes was fantastic

4452
02:34:16,239 --> 02:34:19,680
it was just uh

4453
02:34:17,600 --> 02:34:22,079
we have to make up for the brevity of

4454
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:26,159
life with the intensity of life

4455
02:34:22,079 --> 02:34:29,359
