we recorded this conversation almost

17
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:44,000
exactly three years ago after i attended

18
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,359

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,439
tom graciously invited me to his home

22
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:56,000
where his family a couple of friends and

23
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,679
me spent several hours chatting about

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,520
wrestling in life

25
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,840
we recorded this brief

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,440
podcast conversation that evening and i

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,159
wasn't sure where

28
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,158
how or whether we'll publish it

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,400
but returning to it now three years

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,200
later i realized just how meaningful

31
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,359
that evening was for me and even though

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,478
i was nervous didn't even put on my

33
00:01:15,359 --> 00:01:18,400
jacket

34
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,359
it's a moment i would love to share with

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,359
others

36
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,759
the mix of intensity and heartfelt

37
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:26,560
kindness from tom and his family made me

38
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,478
want to stay in iowa forever i think i

39
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,560
will return there soon enough

40
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:34,400
because of the amazing people there

41
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,640
and because i was still in many ways the

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,520
heart of the indomitable spirit of

43
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,840

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,640
conversation with tom brands

52
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,158
what's the best motivator for you or for

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,239
your athletes

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:09,200
hatred of losing or

55
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,878
love of winning for me personally it was

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,039
definitely the hatred of losing i was

57
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,679
not a guy that was about pageantry

58
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:18,239
i was not a guy that was about the

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,200
parade

60
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,200
when i wrestled in atlanta

61
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,639
i ran in a three-cylinder geo with my

62
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:25,679
wife drove home and mowed the lawn

63
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:26,719
because it hadn't been moaned for a

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,159
month

65
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,759
and i remember one of our neighbors

66
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:31,359
driving by and they were like they did a

67
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,120
double take like well that's the i

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,640
thought he was in atlanta well i was in

69
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,080
atlanta yesterday and just sat on the

70
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:37,279
stand and got a gold medal put around my

71
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,360
neck

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,439
that's how i was that doesn't mean that

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,360
it was the right approach or the wrong

74
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,199
approach it's just what worked for me

75
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,879
but when you were a kid you and terry

76
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:49,679
you dreamed about winning that olympic

77
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:52,639
gold yeah it's all winning then there is

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,560
the the the lure of winning but what

79
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:55,518
drives you is that

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,959
um

81
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,439
you know as you move forward there's

82
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:01,280
just no

83
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:03,120
reason that you have to settle for

84
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,719
anything but being the best

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
and if if

86
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:08,000
it just it would get to you to the point

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,640
where

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,560
that's not going to happen to me again

89
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,359
so what the thing that keeps you up at

90
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,120
night is the the losses and that's not

91
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,560
that's not going to happen to me again

92
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,959
that's the thought that keeps you up at

93
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,360
night that's the thought that drives you

94
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,840
in your training that's why you do

95
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,599
you know nine ropes when gable says do

96
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,519
three ropes and bunny push-ups and

97
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:32,000
you're out of here and you do nine or

98
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,799
you do them until you can't do any more

99
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,799
and

100
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,680
it's a very rare ingredient the older i

101
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,760
get the more rare i find it is

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,680
the ingredient of

103
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:44,239
lost feeding

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,920
feeding that the drive of hard training

105
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,959
maybe that because everybody's so

106
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:50,238
worried about the negative whatever and

107
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,479
you're putting too much pressure on

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,560
yourself so maybe that but what i meant

109
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:56,798
was is when a coach says okay finish

110
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,239
with four ropes and

111
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,438
you know bunny push-ups and four-way

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,039
neck

113
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:05,120
you know i would do 12 or 10. that's

114
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:07,120
rare it's no longer about what the coach

115
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
says it's your own demons that you're

116
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,719
trying to

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,719
exercise out what's

118
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,039
the few losses you've had in your life

119
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,199
are all of them just

120
00:04:15,039 --> 00:04:19,519
melt together or is there something that

121
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,519
stands out in your mind i'm i'm guy that

122
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,680
remembers

123
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,319
my career that well

124
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,840
i know that i am judged on

125
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:31,120
a very small portion of my life and

126
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,359
that's minutes

127
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,879
of wrestling matches you know a lot a

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,240
lot of winning but there's some losing

129
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,680
in there too and

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,680
you know people think they know you

131
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,800
because of that and

132
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,120
they think they know you because they

133
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,439
see you in a press conference but

134
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,439
um you know to go back to the original

135
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:49,040
question

136
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:52,000
you know i don't know how to answer that

137
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,479
so there's no losses that just

138
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,759
that eat at you still there's opponents

139
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:57,758
that i

140
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,400
have learned a great deal from i mean my

141
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,080
loss to john smith

142
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,879
in

143
00:05:01,079 --> 00:05:05,758
1991

144
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,038
us open was something that i learned a

145
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,400
lot

146
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:09,759
about

147
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,959
i learned a lot about positioning i

148
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,479
learned a lot about the importance of

149
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,279
parterre

150
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,240
um

151
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:17,679
you know in a certain kind of crazy way

152
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,120
i learned that i could go with the best

153
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,400
guy in the world even though it was 14

154
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,240
to 4.

155
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:23,599
and this is when tech falls were 15 or

156
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,038
12 points so i didn't get tech fault and

157
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,919
i wasn't that wasn't a badge of honor

158
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:27,439
for me

159
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:28,959
but i knew i could go with him because

160
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,879
it was one point take downs i scored

161
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,478
four takedowns on him

162
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,159
and i learned that i had to move my feet

163
00:05:34,478 --> 00:05:39,199
and i learned what it meant to move your

164
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,800
feet constantly and and there's no

165
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,360
break john smith is a very very intense

166
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,600
competitor that people know that now

167
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,600
six-time world olympic champion and i

168
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,560
felt that firsthand

169
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,520
but i did not go in there um

170
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,160
taking a back seat even though the score

171
00:05:55,519 --> 00:06:00,159
um was very lopsided but you knew you

172
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,039
could stand with the best of the world i

173
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,520
knew that i this is what this is about

174
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,759
and you know what you move your feet

175
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,079
and you don't give up a lace that's so

176
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,759
damn tight that it you can't you know

177
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:13,038
feel your calf muscle

178
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,400
you know and i got to get ready for the

179
00:06:13,038 --> 00:06:16,560
consolation side of the bracket because

180
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:18,959
i believe that was in the semis

181
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,038
you know you know you just learn from

182
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,279
that and it was it was better than

183
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,360
learning from

184
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,119
you know a win over a

185
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,120
second ranked senior level guy when

186
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:33,038
you're a junior in college

187
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,918
you know you rest on the best on a stage

188
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:38,959
so if you look back you probably spent

189
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:41,120
tens of thousands of hours on the mat

190
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,680
spilled sweat blood

191
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,840
even tears maybe maybe a few times

192
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,199
so technically or philosophically how

193
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,119
would you do any of those hours

194
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,439
differently just looking back

195
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,598
at the tens of thousands of hours i

196
00:06:51,439 --> 00:06:56,000
would be more

197
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,680
probably in my older age i probably

198
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
would have been more relaxed in my

199
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,280
training

200
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,520
and probably wouldn't win another cycle

201
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:07,439
if i could do it over again

202
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,879
in 96 i really thought that when gable

203
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,160
retired that i would be the next guy in

204
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,680
line and i was wrong and that was

205
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,360
immature of me

206
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,478
in terms of the coach in terms of the

207
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,800
coach yes

208
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,478
and i knew that gable was close i mean i

209
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,400
didn't know when but it just so happens

210
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,399
you know in 97 was his record-breaking

211
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,159
year and then he retired

212
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,318
but i didn't know how close he was but i

213
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,479
knew that he had you know he went down

214
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,319
with a bad hip injury and

215
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,159
and so you know you're just you're

216
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,800
you're not gonna

217
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,240
so what is what what is a relaxed tom

218
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,199
brands looks like you're saying you

219
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,240
would you would have been a little more

220
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,919
relaxed more like where you know what i

221
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,519
was pretty dang good and i was getting

222
00:07:41,918 --> 00:07:45,198
better every day

223
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,120
but maybe do it a little bit different a

224
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,038
little bit smarter and terry actually

225
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,959
did that going

226
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:54,000
through 2000.

227
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:56,560
he had to do it and he would have been

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:00,478
in in the you know the funny farm let

229
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,319
alone the you know the the physical farm

230
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,800
whatever you want to say

231
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,919
mentally and physically beat up but

232
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,639
he had to learn to

233
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:14,000
less is more type approach and

234
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,560
how it came around was is

235
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,519
you know you work hard at feeling good

236
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,439
you work hard in your recovery so even

237
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:23,680
when you're not

238
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:27,439
wrestling hard in that wrestling room

239
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,840
and looking for the toughest partner

240
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:32,240
to go you're still working hard

241
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,120
in your recovery and massage could be

242
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,038
that

243
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,080
stretching could be that

244
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,278
um thing things like that that are more

245
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,360
fluffy

246
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,799
and that's something you weren't as good

247
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,680
at

248
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,120
never

249
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,479
never um

250
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,440
there's not a place for it with young

251
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,600
people

252
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,279
because in my opinion

253
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,480
there's so much development to have

254
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:54,879
happen

255
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,759
i mean when when you need to learn

256
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:01,120
wrestling you need to be wrestling

257
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:03,278
and as you get older um you your body

258
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,919
won't do it anymore

259
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,639
and so to learn wrestling it's more of a

260
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:11,759
probably a relaxed approach so if you

261
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:14,720
have to choose between two athletes

262
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,360
who would dominate competition one who

263
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,440
drills 100 000 reps of a specific

264
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,519
takedown specific technique

265
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:24,720
or one that spends that time live

266
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,639
wrestling both um it's the same and i

267
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,839
like to live wrestling i was always

268
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,639
wanting to live wrestle bring the

269
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,959
warm-up into the live wrestle let's go

270
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,159
but where i got really really good was a

271
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,639
repetition

272
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:39,199
and i was disciplined enough to know

273
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,879
that the things that you hate

274
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,640
to do in this sport are the things that

275
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,559
make you the very best

276
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:47,120
and that is a rare ingredient as i've

277
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,159
gotten older and you spend a lot of time

278
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,600
communicating that to younger athletes

279
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:53,278
so the thing

280
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,480
if you feel yourself hating something

281
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,320
that's probably a thing you should be

282
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,560
doing yes as a matter of fact i had a

283
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
strength coach when i was really young

284
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:01,359
he was just a

285
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,799
freaking guy that would

286
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,879
we wore white

287
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,439
like he was almost like a nurse nurse's

288
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:10,399
clothes he wore all white from head to

289
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,480
toe and he was in cheyenne wyoming

290
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,720
and his first name was walt

291
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,879
and he taught terry and i to hate the

292
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,040
bar away from you on that last rep when

293
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,320
you're dead and whether it's a curl you

294
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:21,759
hate it up

295
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,920
and then you do the negative and you

296
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,200
hate it down and you hate that bench up

297
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,278
and you hate it you look at the bar and

298
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
you hate it away from you

299
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,320
so

300
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,079
you know i learned and that i was young

301
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,519
i was young and uh i remember being born

302
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:36,879
my mom's sister lived out there and we

303
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,799
were dropped off to stay out there with

304
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,320
our cousins and i was born a little bit

305
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,078
and they always treated us really good

306
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
but this was like the

307
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:45,039
the single most

308
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:47,599
um

309
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,519
bright spot in a weightlifting like

310
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,480
enlightenment even though i lifted

311
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,399
weights

312
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,399
but i never knew the psychology behind

313
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,679
lifting weights it's just to look good

314
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,759
and so you can flex and look in the

315
00:10:55,679 --> 00:11:00,958
mirror or is it for performance

316
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:03,120
and this guy was about performance

317
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:04,958
and you said repetition do you mean

318
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,320
technique i'm talking repetition

319
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,399
technique technique technique drill

320
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,079
drill drill hit hit hit drive finish hit

321
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,278
hit hit drive finish so you believe in

322
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,439
that you believe i believe in that

323
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,519
wholeheartedly so

324
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
i mean i believe that you have to do it

325
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,759
on your own

326
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,920
i don't believe in the coach taking you

327
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,720
to the promised land

328
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:24,399
so

329
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,639
in the guys today

330
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,480
or in yourself how often do you see

331
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,039
people that

332
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,600
grow the belief of doing ten thousand

333
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:34,958
twenty thousand reps i think it's rare i

334
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,879
think it's very rare and i think it's

335
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:38,000
especially rare i mean you can talk

336
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:39,759
about that as a coach but it's

337
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,879
especially rare

338
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,480
to

339
00:11:40,879 --> 00:11:44,639
bring a guy to that understanding but

340
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,079
you never stop trying you're always

341
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,240
trying to reach them

342
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,319
i mean we didn't have a good performance

343
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,360
out there tonight but

344
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,278
you know what you don't stop

345
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,079
communicating

346
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,919
and there's a lot of programs out there

347
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,199
that put their head down

348
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,559
when things aren't going their way and

349
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,560
then as things start going their way

350
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,319
then they rise with the tide

351
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:06,479
there was no difference in the demeanor

352
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,800
that that of our corner and we talk

353
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,959
about that's a philosophy and so you're

354
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:13,199
reaching your guys that way

355
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,278
um so go back to your point or your

356
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,320
question you know do you believe in the

357
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:19,200
in the 10 000 reps and yes i do

358
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
and

359
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,399
how do you inspire people to do that so

360
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,959
well you communicate by example but

361
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,120
communication but i mean that's a

362
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:29,599
in my experience what i've seen

363
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,120
uh communicating the value of repetition

364
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,959
and drilling is a hard thing to

365
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,600
communicate it's hard and it's very rare

366
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,439
to have somebody that goes in there and

367
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,440
will do it on their own do you have

368
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,320
young guys that step up and do that we

369
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,920
do and it's rare and the guys that do it

370
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
on their own and have done it on their

371
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:48,159
own are the guys that

372
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,639
are in that lineup and and doing well

373
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,799
um the other thing is is that

374
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,399
when you talk about uh getting to that

375
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,199
next level

376
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,879
um a lot of times it's

377
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,879
you know what held you back was i did

378
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:02,799
everything the coach asked of me and

379
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:05,278
nothing more

380
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:09,120
right i mean you could be a great guy

381
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:10,799
for a for an a for a coach as an athlete

382
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,879
and you did everything that coach asked

383
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,799
but you did nothing more

384
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,759
so you're really looking for the guys

385
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:17,838
that

386
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:19,679
go way beyond what the coaches we don't

387
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,040
want guys that are looking at their

388
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,559
watch running out of the room when

389
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:24,480
practice is over

390
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,958
we want guys that know what they have to

391
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,720
get done and they might leave early

392
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:30,479
but they're not looking at their watch

393
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,120
they might be done early they might be

394
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:35,440
we might be on a whole different path

395
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,879
and this guy just excuses himself i'm

396
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,519
all about that

397
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:41,198
we are not we are not autocrats there's

398
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,198
an internal engine in there is that

399
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,198
something you're born with or is that

400
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:47,679
something you can develop i think you

401
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,599
are born with it you develop it also and

402
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,439
i think that there has to be comfort and

403
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,240
then go back to communication

404
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,240
that

405
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,799
young people are

406
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,680
comfortable enough to communicate that i

407
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:01,120
need to take the day off

408
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,198
so what do you mean by communication

409
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,440
differently just let exactly so letting

410
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,120
letting athletes

411
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,000
uh be part of their own development

412
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,759
communication to me is is is letting

413
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,919
them know

414
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,360
what their what they need to do to get

415
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,159
themselves in contention to be the

416
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,199
starting quarterback

417
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,519
and then to give them

418
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:25,759
boosts and compliments when they earn

419
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,759
them

420
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,159
and

421
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,039
i don't have time to waste

422
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:32,240
with

423
00:14:31,039 --> 00:14:34,799
um

424
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,079
with lies and cheating

425
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:37,838
and when i say cheating i'm talking

426
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,000
about when they cheat themselves and so

427
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,399
those become very direct conversations

428
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
and the conversation starts like this i

429
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,958
don't have time to waste it neither do

430
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,559
you

431
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,559
and so why are we wasting our time and

432
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:50,879
here's what i mean by that

433
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,759
we're having a conversation about

434
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,120
you know your accountability

435
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,439
if you look in the mirror and you're

436
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,198
accountable then we are we aren't taking

437
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,959
the time to go through this

438
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,120
we're already on our way to solving the

439
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,039
problem problem can't be solved without

440
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,159
that understanding

441
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:07,759
and that's

442
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:09,120
has to do with symptoms that you see in

443
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:10,559
the wrestling room there's something

444
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,679
where the father is not doing with

445
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:15,039
mental emotional spiritual physical

446
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:18,239
everything everything that you know

447
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:19,759
about you know i had a boss and our

448
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,120
athletic director is a great athletic

449
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,198
director and he gives us everything we

450
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,560
need to be successful but i had a boss

451
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,078
his name was fred mims and i didn't

452
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,439
think anybody could be better than him

453
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:29,278
and then all of a sudden this gene

454
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,120
taylor guy came in and i didn't and then

455
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,000
he was pretty doggone good too and he

456
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,078
actually

457
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
you know was just like fred and maybe

458
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,679
even a little bit more current and then

459
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,320
he ended up taking a job at kansas state

460
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:42,239
where he's the athletic director now and

461
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,519
and then this this lady barbara burke

462
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,959
comes in

463
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
and i didn't think anybody could be

464
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,039
better than gene taylor or fred mims and

465
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:50,159
this barbara burke she's better than

466
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:51,759
both of them

467
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,078
and the reason why is because she's a

468
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,320
problem solver she doesn't waste time

469
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,319
she's direct and she's a problem solver

470
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,800
and that's what we need you need problem

471
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
solvers

472
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
so on the flip side

473
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,879
of

474
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,680
problems and technique and repetition

475
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:10,720
here's a a thing called toughness mental

476
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:13,359
toughness

477
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,040
something that maybe you or maybe even

478
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:17,919
iowa in general is a little bit known

479
00:16:15,039 --> 00:16:21,519
for so how do you train mental toughness

480
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:24,559
as a coach you train metal toughness by

481
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,399
putting them in situations that

482
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,919
they're

483
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,198
willing to go through but don't think

484
00:16:27,919 --> 00:16:30,000
they can make it and then they go

485
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,758
through it and then all of a sudden

486
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,759
those marries are down

487
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,560
does that have to do

488
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,240
with physical usually exhaustion

489
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:42,479
the reps on the ropes it has to do with

490
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,278
that and it has to do with

491
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,600
uh understanding why we're doing it and

492
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,480
sometimes understanding why we're doing

493
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,240
it might not come for months but there's

494
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,000
blind faith

495
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,879
and we have a heavyweight in the room

496
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,360
right now this this young guy that

497
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:01,278
he's like that he doesn't necessarily

498
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,360
understand it he asks a lot of questions

499
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,038
but he does it

500
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,240
and he's been here four months now four

501
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:07,759
and a half months now and he's getting

502
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,759
better every day

503
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,240
so mental toughness too is a matter of

504
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:13,679
repetition so that's mental toughness

505
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,279
it's a matter of repetition and having

506
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,160
an open mind and being extremely

507
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:18,959
accountable and and not only accountable

508
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,000
that

509
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,038
when you

510
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,959
maybe

511
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,318
um when something doesn't go your way

512
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,919
that you look in the mirror and own it

513
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,159
but accountable

514
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,400
to the point of view that you know what

515
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,480
i gotta get tough in this situation

516
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,320
right here right now and this is what's

517
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,798
gonna make or break me and i talked

518
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,038
about my own career being defined by you

519
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:41,440
know a couple of minutes on the mat

520
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:43,440
but that's when you're gonna be defined

521
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,640
that's how you're gonna be defined

522
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
that's okay

523
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,799
so

524
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:47,839
people are going to talk about you so

525
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,038
you might as well have them talking

526
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:52,319
about how dog untouched you are

527
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,200
what about

528
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,759
we live in a world now i've often in my

529
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,400
own work i hear about this concept of

530
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,558
work-life balance or over-training

531
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,280
so you've been one of the hardest

532
00:18:02,558 --> 00:18:07,359
workers ever on the mat you've coached

533
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,440
some of the hardest workers ever

534
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,678
do you think it's possible to over train

535
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,480
train too much how big of a concern i

536
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,519
think

537
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,200
peaking and burnout are frames of mind

538
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,759
or burnout as a

539
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,600
is a like you let things probably get to

540
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:22,319
the point where you could have arrested

541
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,159
them

542
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:26,720
with a good frame of mind

543
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,558
but peaking is a frame of mind and

544
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,480
you know you have to know be able to

545
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:32,879
read and that's a lot of it

546
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,919
and the individual athlete also has to

547
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,320
know

548
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,000
that it's a frame of mind and so when

549
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:39,200
you have a coach that's reading that the

550
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,160
right way

551
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,319
and you have an athlete that is knowing

552
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,160
that it when zero hour comes that you're

553
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:48,319
gonna be ready to go

554
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,600
um and knowing that there's light at the

555
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:51,918
end of the tunnel if you feel like

556
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:53,599
you're burning that candle at both ends

557
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,520
lights coming into the at the end of the

558
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:58,079
tunnel i mean you're good to go

559
00:18:55,519 --> 00:19:00,639
so you think about gable and

560
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,960
that whole dream of being carried off

561
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,320
the mat because you worked so hard

562
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,240
again do you think it's possible to

563
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,399
overtrain so you said it's a

564
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,519
it's mental i do think it's possible to

565
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
overtrain if you have a lot of

566
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:12,400
distractions

567
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:14,399
and if you're looking at your watch

568
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,640
running out of the room

569
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,480
then yeah you're gonna in that frame of

570
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,919
mind isn't gonna lend itself to

571
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,558
excellency and

572
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,080
the thing is is we we have to accomplish

573
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:25,599
what we need to get accomplished and get

574
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,879
better every day you can't kind of

575
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,558
accomplish what you need in companies

576
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,520
you have to accomplish it

577
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:33,918
and when when you're in that mindset

578
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,918
then the clock is irrelevant there's no

579
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,200
place for a clock in the wrestling room

580
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,120
and maybe a clock that times a match

581
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,440
but it may be a clock if you know we're

582
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,119
at student athletes here but that's why

583
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,919
we encourage our

584
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:47,519
you know

585
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,000
when you schedule your classes that you

586
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,079
don't have a class that comes right up

587
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,480
to

588
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,798
you know practice time or starts as a

589
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,798
night class and it starts at 5 30. you

590
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:01,200
know go to get the 6 30 class or the 7

591
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:03,119
o'clock so you leave it all behind your

592
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,038
heart your passion is completely there's

593
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,439
no when you walk in that wrestling room

594
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:10,000
there's no distractions and it's never

595
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,440
eternal the only thing that's eternal is

596
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,519
death

597
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,519
you know there's nothing sometimes guys

598
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,599
come in there and they wig out

599
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,000
oh it's an hour and

600
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,158
25 minutes and

601
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,720
or an hour and 45 minutes oh

602
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,400
yeah you have to be willing to go

603
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,319
as long as it takes there's no clock

604
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,080
there's no clock

605
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:31,759
again wrestlers are some of the hardest

606
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,639
some of the toughest people

607
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:37,839
in all sports but weight cutting often

608
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,440
breaks people so what's your thought on

609
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,399
weight cutting both nutrition wise

610
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,840
mental wise how do you

611
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,600
approach and think of it as a coach in

612
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,319
your own career too

613
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:50,000
it's a lot of discipline and it's a lot

614
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:51,839
of discipline

615
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,279
during a very uncomfortable time period

616
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,558
that really doesn't last that long when

617
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:55,839
it feels like it lasts long and it's

618
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,798
painful

619
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,879
and but once you shrink your body down

620
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,639
and if you're hydrated you'll get

621
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,159
through it if you're a little hungry but

622
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,679
you're eating

623
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,919
but you're hydrated

624
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,640
once you break that sweat your energy

625
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,559
depletion goes away that's a fact i've

626
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,840
practiced that you come in and you're

627
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:15,200
yawning

628
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,199
and you're you know you're starting to

629
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,720
shrink your body down and it's that time

630
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,080
of year where hey i got to get my body

631
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,480
shrunk down

632
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:23,759
and you're dehydrated you are dead in

633
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,440
the water

634
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:30,079
but if you're hungry

635
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:31,600
and hydrated when you break that sweat

636
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:33,519
people gotten better with that over the

637
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:36,240
years over the past few days i think

638
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,000
that coaches science is better i think

639
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,200
that coaches communicate it i think they

640
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
always have

641
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,480
i think the bottom line is is having the

642
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,640
energy to implement that and taking a

643
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,798
guide by the hand

644
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,038
when he doesn't understand and he's new

645
00:21:48,798 --> 00:21:52,960
in your program and he's essential

646
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,319
and or he's unwilling to and not

647
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,600
discipline enough because when you think

648
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,599
by the hand enough they will learn that

649
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:59,759
discipline

650
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,558
this is an important aspect of wrestling

651
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,279
buddy you know what i'm saying so you

652
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:06,639
know it's not just go and show up for

653
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:08,558
the match

654
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,080
i mean it's not about just making weight

655
00:22:08,558 --> 00:22:11,519
either you got to be able to make weight

656
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,199
that's part of the

657
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:14,720
warm-up that's part of the process

658
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,640
getting ready to wrestle the whole thing

659
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,120
it's a lifestyle yeah

660
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,840
when did you first start believing

661
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:24,959
you're going to win olympic gold

662
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,558
i don't know i mean i found out i got

663
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,840
really addicted to wrestling really

664
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:30,720
really fast

665
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,918
started late but looking back at my life

666
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,600
um

667
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,640
wrestled my whole life with my twin

668
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:37,199
brother

669
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,520
and when terry and i would fight it was

670
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,400
wrestling and it was to mame

671
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,720
and so if if you were if you're if so if

672
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,679
you're trying to maim me i better be

673
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,440
tough because if i roll over

674
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,798
and expect you to scratch my belly when

675
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,759
you're trying to maim me i won't lose my

676
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,079
head

677
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,839
and tom and terry brands there was no

678
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,639
alpha male

679
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:00,079
and when it was on it was on for real

680
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,880
what do you mean there's no alpha male

681
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,759
there's

682
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,919
both

683
00:23:01,759 --> 00:23:05,279
a lot of twins there's a dominant twin

684
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,038
oh a lot of them

685
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:10,879
very few times is there a situation

686
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:12,480
where you're gonna i'm gonna win every

687
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,880
time and everything and then he's

688
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,480
thinking the same exact way and terry

689
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,640
used to describe it like when we just

690
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,679
get interviewed a lot about our careers

691
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,520
um

692
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,880
like it'd be like you grabbing a

693
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,879
steering wheel and me grabbing a

694
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,240
steering wheel and fighting and that's

695
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,840
what it was like when you would wrestle

696
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,480
him or fight him

697
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,480
and so i had that benefit so when did i

698
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,880
know well i got addicted to wrestling

699
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,640
really really fast in fifth grade and

700
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,679
started to research it and i don't know

701
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,720
why

702
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,120
and talked about the olympics and

703
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,038
um put it in my head and

704
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:46,639
a member

705
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,558
said something about being an olympic

706
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,759
champion in fifth grade and somebody

707
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:51,278
made fun of me and i got into fighting

708
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:54,079
the playground

709
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:55,679
and i remember um

710
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:56,720
getting pulled in getting in trouble for

711
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,960
that

712
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:00,960
and the people that got me in trouble

713
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,360
for that were smart enough

714
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,360
to not rake me over the coals but they

715
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,199
researched or they actually found out

716
00:24:05,359 --> 00:24:08,558
what the fight was about and i was

717
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,600
distraught

718
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,798
i was i was really emotional like crying

719
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,519
or whatever you want to say you don't

720
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,278
want to admit that too many times

721
00:24:15,519 --> 00:24:19,200
but it wasn't because i got beat up or

722
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:22,319
got my nose blood he never got punched

723
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,080
in the face or broke my arm

724
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:26,000
or there was any pain it was because

725
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,960
they stomped on my dream and they

726
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,119
doubted me and so i fought for that

727
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,880
and you know that was a lesson there's

728
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:35,678
going to be a lot of doubters

729
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:39,200
and one thing we talk about as a staff

730
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:42,400
is our staff has to be lockstep

731
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,880
in that hallway in our offices

732
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:46,960
and when you deviate outside of that

733
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,520
that is

734
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,360
heresy so everybody has to be on board

735
00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:53,759
confident that you're going to be number

736
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,759
one when we go forward and we go put our

737
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,759
public foot forward there is a decision

738
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:58,960
we are unified and there is no

739
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:00,798
backbiting

740
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,200
and we have great people right now we

741
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,519
hadn't had that before we've had the

742
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,038
tractors in our hawkeye wrestling club

743
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:09,679
we've had guys that would go out and get

744
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:12,158
rolled up in ankle laces and not care

745
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:14,480
in our club and we got brandon sorenson

746
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,960
who got rolled up by james green last

747
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,919
night but i'll tell you what i don't i

748
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,000
don't have a problem with that you know

749
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,759
why because i know it means a lot to him

750
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,119
he didn't roll over

751
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,278
he didn't quit because he was on the

752
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,519
consolation side of a bracket

753
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,839
and so when you have that and then you

754
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,440
have you know if there's a disagreement

755
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,720
it's behind closed doors and then you're

756
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,159
moving forward

757
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,159
and when you have people that when

758
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,240
they're meeting your fans and your

759
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,799
supporters you know they're talking the

760
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,200
right way with the right message

761
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,798
and anything that's caddy wonkas to that

762
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,880
you got to be careful there

763
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,798
you got to be careful there

764
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,960
so that in terms of affirmations in

765
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,720
terms of really believing as a team as

766
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,000
an individual believing that you're the

767
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,200
best in the world

768
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,079
did did you i'm sure you had detractors

769
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,840
you had

770
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,000
people that continued after fifth grade

771
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:05,278
and that's probably where my hatred of

772
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,798
losing trump's my love for winning

773
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:08,839
because i wanted to shove it up their

774
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,639
rear end bad

775
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,439
yeah

776
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,440
and the thing is is we maintain a high

777
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,960
level and there's very few programs so

778
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:19,440
oklahoma state

779
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,519
ohio state now penn state

780
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,000
i mean there's four programs that try to

781
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:26,000
win a national title every year and

782
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,400
that's it and these these other teams

783
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,038
they get up and they got a good team and

784
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,720
they get up and they get going and then

785
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:34,879
when when things don't go well okay

786
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,159
we're gonna do it next year or this is a

787
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,480
down year we're gonna we're gonna get

788
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,400
right we're three years out so no matter

789
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,000
what you're fighting for first we we do

790
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
and we haven't won and now you say well

791
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,640
we've been one in eight years well

792
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,400
you're right we haven't

793
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,000
but look at our results are better

794
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,480
better than anybody out there and it's

795
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,679
me besides penn state and it's because

796
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,679
of our

797
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,679
mentality and because we have great

798
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:58,880
people ryan morningstar bobby tell from

799
00:26:55,679 --> 00:27:00,640
terry brands our medical team even

800
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,559
our strength coach quinn holland we're

801
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,400
all on the same page

802
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,558
and when i send something i hit it

803
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,798
immediately i don't have time to waste

804
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:11,678
there will not be an ascension in that

805
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:14,558
hallway everybody's in uh together yeah

806
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,559
1996 olympic games in atlanta can you

807
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:19,759
take me through the day when you're

808
00:27:16,558 --> 00:27:21,200
going for the 62kg

809
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:23,839
what did you eat

810
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:27,120
drink what did you think oh it really

811
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,959
doesn't matter um i have a routine that

812
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,199
you know i had a routine as a competitor

813
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,919
that i could run through right now

814
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,720
um it was a lot of self-talk very very

815
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,240
positive self-talk visualization yes

816
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,919
visualization

817
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,558
self-talk

818
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,320
and and that's how i i was able to relax

819
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,440
and getting ready for matches my whole

820
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,079
life

821
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,600
learned that very early age at a camp in

822
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,759
a developmental camp

823
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,918
at a young age terry united

824
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,919
and

825
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,640
i can tell you what i ate

826
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,559
and i can tell you what i did to relax

827
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,240
and it doesn't matter

828
00:28:00,558 --> 00:28:03,119
what you have to do is you have to find

829
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,399
that

830
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:06,639
piece

831
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:07,918
and i just know that when i was getting

832
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,919
ready for

833
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,200
the finals match i had gone back to my

834
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:16,320
room i had my relaxed material

835
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,200
you know and i was able to relax because

836
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:18,639
i

837
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,960
prepared for it

838
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,278
uh hopefully i'm right on this but

839
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,798
just looking at the insane bracket you

840
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:26,480
had to go through you had to beat just

841
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:27,519
to get to the faunas to be three world

842
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,278
champions

843
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,200
eventually world champ i mean they've

844
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,880
and you know what i don't talk about

845
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,240
that and nobody else does either but

846
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,360
everybody talks about in their own

847
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,519
career

848
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:40,479
so now you're making my head big

849
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,319
but yeah i had a road i had a road

850
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,759
you're right that is the hardest bracket

851
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,200
i've seen so i've talked to a lot of

852
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:46,960
olympic champions

853
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,759
this is the hardest bracket i've seen of

854
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,519
any champion so uh maybe i'm confused on

855
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,200
this but it seemed like a really tough

856
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,038
day for you did you have

857
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,440
did you know the bracket ahead of time

858
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,158
did you know you faced you you see the

859
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,360
draw and it's a two-day tournament

860
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,120
so psychology comes into it as much as

861
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:07,599
physical shape

862
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:09,038
um you know because there's those you

863
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,558
gotta sleep

864
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,158
you know the night before after the

865
00:29:10,558 --> 00:29:14,319
weigh-in then you gotta sleep again that

866
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,559
next night after your semi-final match

867
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,839
is gonna be in the morning

868
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:19,359
you know and then you have to go back

869
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:21,519
and rest cause your final matches and

870
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:24,000
until whatever time it was

871
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,200
and so all this relaxation and all that

872
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,798
stuff that you just talked about that

873
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,120
visualization and self-talk that's what

874
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:32,079
helps it's your routine

875
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:35,278
and was there any doubt any fear any

876
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,558
anything there the fear is the type of

877
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,319
fear

878
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,278
and i just talked about this to one of

879
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:42,720
my athletes today jack dempsey talked

880
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:44,960
about fear

881
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,880
and the fear of losing is what motivated

882
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,558
him to try to take his opponent's head

883
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,000
off he was a boxer

884
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:51,359
and

885
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,919
that's okay

886
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:57,278
so fear of competition fear of screwing

887
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:59,440
up fear of oh i don't feel good no

888
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,880
no but that little fear that you know

889
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,960
what there's somebody out there that

890
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,600
thinks that you know what they they're

891
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,120
gonna they're gonna revel in my

892
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,038
they're gonna they're gonna

893
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,719
they're gonna eat it up in my misery

894
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:12,879
they're gonna love they're gonna be

895
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,919
thriving because i fail

896
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:18,640
and and i'm not gonna let that happen

897
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,399
your identical twin brother terry you've

898
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,360
been adam like you said

899
00:30:20,398 --> 00:30:24,798
your whole life and you're both

900
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,038
some of the greatest wrestlers of all

901
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,319
time you won the gold medal he won the

902
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,079
bronze medal

903
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,879
you've mentioned you know all that

904
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:34,319
really matters is the six minutes or

905
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,480
you know just a few minutes sometimes a

906
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:38,720
few seconds to find your whole career so

907
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,278
how do you think about that thin line

908
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,200
the tragic line at the olympic level

909
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,278
between winning and losing i think you

910
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,038
come to peace that

911
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:48,839
in the end when it's over that you did

912
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:52,000
the best you could

913
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:54,158
and that's certainly the case with terry

914
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,159
um he has a career credentials are

915
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,760
better than mine internationally

916
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,360
you know he won two world championships

917
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:02,240
i won one

918
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:03,359
and he won olympic bronze medal and

919
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,960
um

920
00:31:03,359 --> 00:31:07,519
you know i won olympic gold medal but i

921
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,519
only won one and the thing is is

922
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,480
that's not what's important anyway

923
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,720
what's important is is that

924
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,880
when it's all over

925
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,278
you know how do you

926
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,440
look back on it and you're kind of like

927
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:22,640
well you just said that you made sure

928
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,840
that you weren't going to leave anything

929
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,600
undone

930
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:27,678
but you know what there were tournaments

931
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,879
where i did leave things undone and so

932
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,720
how do you come back from that well

933
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,679
terry never came back from 2000 because

934
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,519
he retired well you know what you

935
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,960
duplicate and exceed

936
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,159
when you're communicating to these young

937
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,919
athletes

938
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,480
and because of that experience that

939
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,399
makes terry a better coach because of

940
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,558
you know

941
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:47,839
1995 that makes me a better coach

942
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:49,759
you know

943
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:50,639
realizing that there are certain things

944
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,879
that

945
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:54,960
unraveled in that year that i could have

946
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,840
controlled looking back on it

947
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,278
and when you have that perspective you

948
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,398
can communicate

949
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,079
so what control is there

950
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:07,038
can you control everything

951
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:09,119
how big of a role is luck control

952
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:11,038
how you react to an injury

953
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:13,119
control that so you can't you don't have

954
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:15,839
any control over it it's over

955
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,199
you know whatever and

956
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:18,000
whatever happened

957
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,038
but

958
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,398
relax

959
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,720
and you learn to deal with injuries

960
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:25,199
better because of that you have that

961
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,278
experience that you let this thing maybe

962
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:29,919
get the best of you and that's just an

963
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:32,000
example and

964
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,960
you know terry put a lot of demons to

965
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,200
rest

966
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:37,679
with that bronze medal

967
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:40,000
so becoming an olympic medalist a few

968
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,240
demons could relax well a little he will

969
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,159
never admit that and he probably is

970
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,399
truthful and i should i'm speaking for

971
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:51,039
him but he is truthful when he says that

972
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:52,639
but if if i look at it and bronze sucks

973
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,200
um but

974
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:57,759
if i look at it he did put some demons

975
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,960
in rest and i'm proud of him for it

976
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:02,798
there's something there that is

977
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,960
a consolation

978
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:05,918
in the fact that he won the consolation

979
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,319
medal

980
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,519
the consolation medal sucks but there is

981
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,439
a consolation that he won the

982
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,440
consolation that's a tough medal to win

983
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,919
by the way yeah

984
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,798
but do you see the the shakespearean

985
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,720
tragedy of it all that uh the line

986
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,079
between winning and losing so you'd

987
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:23,360
often say that you know winning is

988
00:33:22,079 --> 00:33:25,278
everything but

989
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,558
it feels like especially at the olympic

990
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:30,960
level or you talk about ncaa finals or

991
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:32,798
that tournament you know a

992
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,000
a split second

993
00:33:32,798 --> 00:33:38,480
miss move can result in a loss where you

994
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,398
dominated all the way up to there

995
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,798
you that's where your psychology comes

996
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:45,199
in and that's where the repetition and

997
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,359
all of the self-talk and visualization

998
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,038
and the physical shape and

999
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,678
everything comes together

1000
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:54,640
and so that doesn't happen and tonight

1001
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,480
you we got beat twice

1002
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,320
actually three times and we out wrestled

1003
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:01,440
those we we lost three matches and we

1004
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,798
out wrestled the guy for six minutes and

1005
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,519
thirty seconds

1006
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:08,398
or one one match went to overtime

1007
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,239
and if our guys can move forward with

1008
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:11,039
the right perspective i'm confident that

1009
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,118
they'll

1010
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,800
be better

1011
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,879
i'll tell you what i'd take our guy over

1012
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,399
their guy any day

1013
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:21,440
any day because our guys get up for

1014
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,960
every match and now we got a lot to work

1015
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,039
on

1016
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,519
right a lot to work on but you know what

1017
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,878
i can say all that and i'll take our guy

1018
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:30,960
and blah blah blah but what are they

1019
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:32,000
going to do tonight in their meal how

1020
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,519
are they going what are they going to do

1021
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,239
tonight and their rest what are they

1022
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,759
going to do tomorrow in their recovery

1023
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,878
on their own necessarily what are they

1024
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,960
going to do

1025
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,000
monday

1026
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,878
great

1027
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:47,760
wrestlers can

1028
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:49,279
use their imagination with a win

1029
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,720
that they're not

1030
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,599
satisfied with

1031
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:55,039
and go forward as if it was a loss but

1032
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,079
it's still easier to go forward with

1033
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,320
that win

1034
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,519
but they can they don't just

1035
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:03,599
oh i want i'm fine it goes on but then

1036
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:05,679
when they lose the exact same way that

1037
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,119
they could have lost before then they go

1038
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:08,159
off the deep end and then that's when

1039
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,160
they're going to make the change in

1040
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:12,399
their life and we talked to we talked

1041
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,440
about that to our team tonight

1042
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,200
and

1043
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,119
the the mature

1044
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:19,759
rare ingredient is

1045
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,599
is guys that can get better

1046
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,359
even with success

1047
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,160
like it was a loss without beating

1048
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:27,679
themselves up that's complicated it is

1049
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,838
it's a balance

1050
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:32,559
you often talk about iowa's focus on

1051
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:34,960
creating individual champions

1052
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,400
like spencer lee

1053
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,679
can you explain the philosophy of

1054
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:42,838
focusing on individuals versus the team

1055
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:46,000
i think that we need to put them both

1056
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:48,799
together and the individual impacts the

1057
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,800
team and

1058
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:53,519
you know we haven't done that since 2010

1059
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,358
and we need to do a better job of

1060
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:57,199
putting 10 weight classes out there that

1061
00:35:55,358 --> 00:35:59,838
contribute to the team and

1062
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:03,039
if it's not ten then it's nine

1063
00:35:59,838 --> 00:36:05,199
and if it's not nine it can't be four

1064
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,599
you know and that takes a lot of pride

1065
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,559
and it takes a lot of

1066
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,079
um

1067
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:13,279
you know where the coach is on top of it

1068
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,359
and

1069
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,480
you know you're not just

1070
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:20,639
working on the easy things

1071
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,039
the glaring things you're working on

1072
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:26,159
everything

1073
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:27,920
what do you mean by everything so the

1074
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:29,679
like there's just some you know there's

1075
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,358
ideas that

1076
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,358
um

1077
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:35,440
when you're a coach uh

1078
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:38,319
that aren't they're beneath the surface

1079
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,320
and you've got to find them

1080
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,800
and so when communication comes in yeah

1081
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,639
but you're talking about

1082
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,599
yeah we got to move forward what does

1083
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:49,279
that mean well i know what that means

1084
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,880
but how many how many

1085
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,560
guys really know what that means in

1086
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,079
their program

1087
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:58,000
you know there's so many levels of that

1088
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:00,000
you've said before that winning is

1089
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,358
everything

1090
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,599
uh

1091
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,799
and that means people lose most people

1092
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,320
lose

1093
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,720
you know there's there's really in

1094
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,720
whatever the context is only one winner

1095
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:13,118
in many parts of our world today outside

1096
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:14,879
of wrestling that concept the brutal

1097
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,160
honesty of that is uncomfortable for

1098
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:21,119
people so how do you think

1099
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:21,118
about this very

1100
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,680
philosophical difficult concept of

1101
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,960
you know

1102
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,039
they're only being one winner that

1103
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,880
winning is everything this kind of

1104
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:33,199
really painful idea

1105
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,880
i don't think that that's

1106
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,118
a bad thing to have that mentality i

1107
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,280
mean i think a kudukov

1108
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,680
i remember a story i read about him he

1109
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,720
comes to mind um

1110
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,118
you know

1111
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,480
sargosh i remember when he lost in

1112
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,160
london

1113
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,920
and i remember the look on his face and

1114
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:53,440
those are some of the greatest wrestlers

1115
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,720
in the history of the sport freestyle

1116
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,838
wrestling and

1117
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,319
um

1118
00:37:55,838 --> 00:38:01,279
you know what it's what works for you

1119
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,200
and you you can talk about being at

1120
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,359
peace with your results and and that the

1121
00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:06,719
approach is in the journey is what it's

1122
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,440
about but

1123
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,879
um and that's great and that relaxes

1124
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,119
some champions and that makes some

1125
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,000
champions really really tick

1126
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:20,000
um but not everybody

1127
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,760
so it's okay it's okay and if that wigs

1128
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,079
you out that that really makes you

1129
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,079
uptight then then then go the other

1130
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,000
route you have to find what works for

1131
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:29,039
you that takes a lot of work if you're

1132
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,719
lazy

1133
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,440
forget it

1134
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,118
forget it

1135
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,639
so you and terry

1136
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,920
but in general

1137
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:40,078
how do you find the line between

1138
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,400
extremely physical extreme physical

1139
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,119
wrestling and rough wrestling or angry

1140
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,400
wrestling so to which degree has anger

1141
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:48,880
whether it's in your wrestling room

1142
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,559
these days or in your own career entered

1143
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,519
wrestling do you see it as a tool that

1144
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,719
can be

1145
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:54,480
used

1146
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,719
in the wrestling match i think there's a

1147
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,880
balance or not even a male there's a

1148
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:01,199
line that you go up to and you can't

1149
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,079
cross it sportsmanship is everything you

1150
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,480
can get dinged for points you can get

1151
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,680
thrown out of tournaments there's rules

1152
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,760
with um

1153
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,598
flagrant misconduct where you're kicked

1154
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,680
out of the match

1155
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,838
other team gets the points and then you

1156
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:19,118
have to sit the next meet

1157
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:21,759
so it's very serious the ncaa

1158
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,400
sends a message a very serious message

1159
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,920
about sportsmanship and so we talk about

1160
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,838
that the other thing with wrestling is

1161
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,838
there's rules in wrestling

1162
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:32,159
these guys that are tough guys

1163
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:33,920
outside of the rules

1164
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:37,358
that's that's what you want in your

1165
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,358
opponent that means they're frustrated

1166
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,280
you got to be you got to be a tough guy

1167
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:45,599
inside the rules of the sport

1168
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,200
that's that's more honorable

1169
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,039
than cold cocking somebody and knocking

1170
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,879
them out so yeah anger doesn't mean

1171
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,599
breaking the rules but i mean you know

1172
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,200
you

1173
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,720
a lot of people know you just watching

1174
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,078
you as a coach

1175
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:57,519
there's quite a bit of passion there

1176
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,680
well come and do what you're doing

1177
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,679
tonight i mean break bread with me in my

1178
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,440
kitchen and see how big of a jackass i

1179
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,279
am now you're a pretty nice guy well i'm

1180
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,960
not asking for that necessarily but

1181
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,920
thanks i'm saying

1182
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,599
you know what you you as a coach i mean

1183
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,599
come okay come spend a month in our

1184
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:14,400
program and you'll see really what kind

1185
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,160
of

1186
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,400
what kind of people we are

1187
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:20,639
and there's a stigma out there because

1188
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,800
they are very threatened by our program

1189
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:26,239
there's nobody else that threatens

1190
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,519
the sport of wrestling like we do and

1191
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:30,000
that's the truth

1192
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:31,838
there's a legend to iowa wrestling

1193
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,079
there's uh it's one of the most

1194
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:36,318
intimidating there's a legend to john

1195
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,400
smith it's the same thing

1196
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:40,480
but they can't up for john smith they

1197
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,519
get up for oklahoma state

1198
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:45,519
they get up for penn state

1199
00:40:43,519 --> 00:40:46,639
my question is okay i'll answer it this

1200
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,639
way i'll give you i'll give you an

1201
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:52,239
example in my coaching career i coached

1202
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:53,920
at virginia tech for 22 months

1203
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:54,959
we recruited the number one recruiting

1204
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,440
class

1205
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,800
we got the administration to change

1206
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:02,960
100 180 how they looked at wrestling

1207
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,720
here's the thing and because of how

1208
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,960
serious we were and because we weren't

1209
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:08,559
idiots

1210
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,440
we were able to do that with our

1211
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,838
administration but my point is this

1212
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,519
we tried to win

1213
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,199
we tried to win even at virginia tech it

1214
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:19,119
wasn't a stepping stone for me it ended

1215
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:21,039
up being one quickly

1216
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:23,358
and looking back on it i was a fool to

1217
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:25,599
think that i'd be there for 20 years but

1218
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:27,119
you believed you would be i did yeah i

1219
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:28,079
did

1220
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,240
i did

1221
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:32,480
so do you remember a time

1222
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:33,598
that you really pushed yourself to your

1223
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,519
limits

1224
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,960
so gable talks about having to be

1225
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,679
carried off the mat

1226
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:41,760
have you really found that level i said

1227
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:44,318
something about that too in a book and i

1228
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,160
think i was misquoted one time um

1229
00:41:44,318 --> 00:41:48,880
and actually it was gabo's quote i was

1230
00:41:46,159 --> 00:41:51,440
trying to make the point that gable's

1231
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,720
quote was like this and

1232
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,159
you know they weren't making it like it

1233
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:56,078
was my own ones i think it was a first

1234
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,639
wrestling tough book but

1235
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,880
it's good it's a good book

1236
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:03,838
but the story is gables

1237
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,480
and i don't know if there's anybody that

1238
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:09,519
has done that besides him

1239
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:10,719
and i think that's a very rare quality

1240
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,759
um

1241
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:15,039
but i've definitely been in that nirvana

1242
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,240
level

1243
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,519
of you know either you you could go all

1244
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,879
day long

1245
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:23,199
and it doesn't you have to you have to

1246
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,880
shoot me to stop me yeah

1247
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:27,279
but there's a balance because you're not

1248
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,640
going hard with and holding your breath

1249
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,720
it's not

1250
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,480
it's a relaxed

1251
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,279
and like

1252
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,400
you've got a guy cornered and who's most

1253
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,319
dangerous

1254
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,920
well the guy that's cornered and so

1255
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:41,358
that's where you relax i'm not bum

1256
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,760
rushing him

1257
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:45,679
i'm relaxed i'm still moving fake and

1258
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,119
very fluid guy falls down on his face i

1259
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,039
run around behind him

1260
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:50,720
that's offense

1261
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:53,679
you don't have to just

1262
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,439
grunt to the leg and call that offense

1263
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:58,719
offense is a

1264
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,079
in and out smooth now you sound like a

1265
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:01,519
russian wrestler

1266
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:03,119
yeah well that's

1267
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:04,639
they're the best

1268
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,720
in a certain light looking at the

1269
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:08,639
history of wrestling

1270
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,239
wrestling is much bigger than folk style

1271
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,159
freestyle greco

1272
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:15,118
it's it's one of the oldest forms of

1273
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:18,318
combat period there's been cave drawings

1274
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,760
15 000 years ago do you ever see

1275
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,920
so you're you're

1276
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,680
uh one of the great coaches of all time

1277
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,039
you're not focusing a particular rule

1278
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:26,719
style right now

1279
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:28,318
but do you ever see wrestling as bigger

1280
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:31,679
than all of

1281
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:33,759
this you know as as uh one of the pure

1282
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,519
combats i do and we're raising 20

1283
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,520
million dollars for a facility to make

1284
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:40,480
it the best facility on the planet we

1285
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:42,400
have a vision to build the best facility

1286
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,838
on planet earth and put the best

1287
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,358
wrestlers in it

1288
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:50,000
and that is bigger than wrestling

1289
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:52,719
it's for the university of iowa

1290
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,920
and our donors are doing it for the

1291
00:43:52,719 --> 00:43:59,118
university of iowa but it is about

1292
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,800
the value of wrestling to me also

1293
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,400
there is so much value to wrestling

1294
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,240
blind

1295
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,079
blind people don't play football they

1296
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,399
wrestle blind people don't play

1297
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,680
basketball i mean maybe they do

1298
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,240
but it'd be

1299
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:15,039
very difficult they can wrestle

1300
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,479
wrestling is a feel sport

1301
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,639
yeah there's no ball there's nothing

1302
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,358
it's just two guys or two girls and

1303
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:22,719
that's it that's right and you can

1304
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,318
i mean i'm not going to say you can't

1305
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,559
because somebody will get a hold of this

1306
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:28,239
and i'll get an email or a letter that

1307
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:30,000
says you said blind people can't play

1308
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:32,000
baseball and blah blah

1309
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,239
i'm just saying that blind people can

1310
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,079
wrestle very effectively yes i've

1311
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,479
wrestled with with my eyes shut i mean

1312
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:41,280
was honest about it too

1313
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,559
and it was i was effective so why why

1314
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:46,560
was i able to be effective because

1315
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,679
wrestling is it isn't is a sport that

1316
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,440
you you can overcome a lot your demons

1317
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:53,919
that you're overcoming

1318
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,838
they're not limited

1319
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,760
with

1320
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:59,279
whether i'm blind or not the demons that

1321
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,240
are overcoming are inside you you have

1322
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:04,160
to overcome those demons from within

1323
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,078
so what's the future of iowa wrestling

1324
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:08,159
look like with this facility and this

1325
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,000
momentum you have now and this great

1326
00:45:08,159 --> 00:45:12,799
group of guys you have now we have a

1327
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:16,239
good young group of guys and

1328
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:18,560
um you know there is a lot of buzz

1329
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:21,279
in the program and probably hasn't been

1330
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:24,078
this much buzz for quite some time

1331
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:25,599
and our job is to

1332
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:28,720
you know be

1333
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,480
relaxed and be focused and not get

1334
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:32,480
caught up in the buzz

1335
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,400
but we have to put it together

1336
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,838
and we have a catalyst spencer lee but

1337
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,200
he's gonna have to he's gonna have to

1338
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:39,119
get better

1339
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,159
and we have some other catalysts as well

1340
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,358
that are

1341
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:45,759
um you know gonna help us in the future

1342
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:47,838
um but they gotta get better

1343
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,680
and so all this stuff about independence

1344
00:45:47,838 --> 00:45:51,119
and accountability

1345
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:54,000
and you know

1346
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,838
being able to get better every day under

1347
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,960
duress

1348
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:58,480
and

1349
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,480
not knowing that you're getting better

1350
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:01,920
but you are you know you know what that

1351
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,760
you know what i mean by that

1352
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:06,000
like the great thing about gable was

1353
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,280
wrestling for him was is you were

1354
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,639
getting better and you didn't know you

1355
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,200
were getting better

1356
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,279
well yeah just like you said uh grow

1357
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,719
from success so even you

1358
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,839
you never allow yourself to think that

1359
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,078
you're

1360
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,838
that you're you're getting good all of a

1361
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,200
sudden you do something in the practice

1362
00:46:19,838 --> 00:46:22,559
room that you've been working on and all

1363
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:25,358
of a sudden you hit it it's like it was

1364
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:28,880
automatic yeah and then that you know

1365
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:32,078
become yeah that multiplies success and

1366
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:35,280
so if i may say so you're a bit of a

1367
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:37,440
man of the bible wha what's

1368
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,359
where do you go

1369
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,318
what do you go to the bible for your

1370
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:42,159
faith

1371
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:43,358
strength love paper same things they

1372
00:46:42,159 --> 00:46:45,358
talked about things that you can't

1373
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:46,318
control you turn them over

1374
00:46:45,358 --> 00:46:48,159
so

1375
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:49,679
the biggest thing for me is i gotta turn

1376
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:50,960
over the things that i can't control

1377
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:52,399
turn them over

1378
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:53,920
to that power

1379
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:55,358
and i'm gonna be a lot better off and

1380
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,200
that's the reason why i'm not in the

1381
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,519
funny farm

1382
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:01,679
because it's very competitive to me

1383
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:04,880
yeah it's very serious

1384
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:07,279
that we we know that these young

1385
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:08,960
wrestlers come to school here to be the

1386
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:12,160
best that they can be and to accomplish

1387
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,159
goals that like me when i was young

1388
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:16,399
they've set out to accomplish

1389
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:18,078
and they chose iowa to do that so we

1390
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,680
have to deliver

1391
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,680
and because of that

1392
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:29,598
peace with god you know it's pure

1393
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:30,799
it's a pure motivation it's a pure

1394
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,440
um

1395
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,000
platform it's not it's not

1396
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:38,880
doing this for my ego

1397
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,239
we're not corrupt people we're not liars

1398
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,720
and cheaters

1399
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:44,799
and so often

1400
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:46,239
uh that gets in the way of a decent

1401
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,920
person

1402
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,799
yeah first and foremost you're a good

1403
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:54,318
person and god helps you be that

1404
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:54,318
yeah and we're serious about wrestling

1405
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,639
uh

1406
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,480
so

1407
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:01,199
a couple more questions

1408
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,280
what's the role of family in wrestling

1409
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:06,639
you mentioned your wife

1410
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,960
who i read uh turned you down

1411
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,719
when you asked her for a phone number

1412
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,639
said it's in the phone book that's

1413
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:16,239
pretty smooth her story of that is that

1414
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:18,000
she didn't want me to have to remember

1415
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:19,279
the number

1416
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,280
and i say

1417
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,519
at this point and i say there's no way

1418
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,800
and i remember it very clearly like hey

1419
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:28,239
it's in the phone book and i was like

1420
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:30,640
okay she's blowing me off that's okay

1421
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:33,039
but luckily anyway here's the thing with

1422
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,879
family i mean we we have great people in

1423
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,880
our program we have great parents we

1424
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:39,680
have a culture of parents

1425
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:41,920
that that's part of the buzz

1426
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,480
and this class that you see wrestling

1427
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:47,519
right now that's been here a year now

1428
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,599
lee mirin costello warner and then lugo

1429
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:50,880
was a transfer and i'm forgetting

1430
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,160
somebody and i don't want to forget

1431
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,480
anybody but

1432
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:57,759
um these parents are phenomenal and

1433
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:00,318
that's a different parental culture

1434
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,280
so the camera's dad is the same and

1435
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:02,400
and

1436
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,760
so

1437
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,599
there's a lot of good there and that

1438
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,680
that's a big that's a big

1439
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,160
a big movement because how we talk to

1440
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:12,239
parents we don't talk to parents to get

1441
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,318
along with them we talk to parents to

1442
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,558
help them understand you know where

1443
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,318
we're at with their sons

1444
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,920
and when you can have a direct

1445
00:49:18,318 --> 00:49:22,880
conversation with a parent who is

1446
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,559
helping his son or her son the mom

1447
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:26,400
helping her son

1448
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,640
to be accountable

1449
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,000
and to own it then you can get a lot

1450
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:31,759
accomplished and that's what we've been

1451
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,159
able to do and so you're solving

1452
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:36,079
problems like i talked about earlier

1453
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:38,879
that's part of the family the other part

1454
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,880
of the family is the coaches

1455
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,960
are like family the other part of the

1456
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,599
family is the coaches

1457
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:49,039
significant others and wives are part of

1458
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:50,640
the family and we fed you know we fed 40

1459
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:53,440
guys and

1460
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,920
an entire coaching staff and wives and

1461
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,480
their children here at thanksgiving

1462
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:01,200
and that equals 70 people

1463
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,318
and it's it's fun

1464
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:03,358
it's fun

1465
00:50:02,318 --> 00:50:06,159
so

1466
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:08,480
family means administration gary barna

1467
00:50:06,159 --> 00:50:10,558
my my athletic director gives us

1468
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,719
everything that we need to be successful

1469
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:14,319
and he has an open mind

1470
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:16,000
for the sport of wrestling and

1471
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:17,679
wrestling's important in iowa so that's

1472
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,920
a no-brainer but

1473
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,759
not if you're not a wrestling guy

1474
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,559
but he seems we do it the right way and

1475
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:24,400
so

1476
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:26,480
the commitment is there from him if we

1477
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,000
were doofuses

1478
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,199
you know he the commitment wouldn't be

1479
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,838
there

1480
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,519
so family is everybody's all in i mean

1481
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:35,599

great my daughter's a manager as well

1495
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:04,799
it's great

1496
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:08,160
um they're they're hard-working young

1497
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,880
women our hawkeye wrestling club is is

1498
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:12,318
where it needs to be in terms of how

1499
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,960
they help

1500
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,079
in their role and now we have four women

1501
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,318
in there

1502
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,440
and that's great

1503
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:21,279
and

1504
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,519
you know at least one of their dads is

1505
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:26,079
super involved with us but

1506
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:28,318
um and so it's

1507
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:29,920
one thing that i've learned is that you

1508
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:32,159
have to have that

1509
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,400
and if you don't have that then you have

1510
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:36,639
to address it quickly

1511
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,000
and those outliers you know let's solve

1512
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,318
that problem let's get it out in the

1513
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,440
open here right and if there you know if

1514
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:42,719
it doesn't work out it's not going to

1515
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,358
work out

1516
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,879
that's a heck of a thanksgiving dinner

1517
00:51:45,358 --> 00:51:48,880
yeah next year well i don't know if it'd

1518
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,880
be legal but i'd have to check with our

1519
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,880
compliance and

1520
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,880
you know they'd have to vet you

1521
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,800
you can come you can come and see what

1522
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,800
it's all about this room is full

1523
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,318
oh man well yeah i'll be back next year

1524
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,879
then all right awesome

1525
00:52:02,318 --> 00:52:05,920
last question in 2014 i watched this

1526
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,280
video

1527
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,400
four years ago

1528
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,480
uh

1529
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,920
of you competing

1530
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:16,159
in i believe your first swim meet

1531
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,960
against your brother terry

1532
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:20,719
uh and you came out victorious

1533
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,119
not really

1534
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:24,799
okay so let's i wonder

1535
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,760
here's what happened

1536
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:30,240
i had researched this thing because i'm

1537
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:32,319
that's how i am you practice no i didn't

1538
00:52:30,239 --> 00:52:35,358
but i researched it in swimming if you

1539
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:37,199
flinch on that starter block

1540
00:52:35,358 --> 00:52:38,558
it's a false start you can't twitch a

1541
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:40,239
finger

1542
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:41,760
and because they would be doing that to

1543
00:52:40,239 --> 00:52:43,919
get their buddy to move or the guy next

1544
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,280
to him you know so you have to be

1545
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,680
rock solid

1546
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,760
well when we went terry was leaning

1547
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,279
forward as the gun was going off so he's

1548
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,680
moving

1549
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:55,200
and so i was like no no no false start

1550
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:56,960
no no no no and he couldn't hear me he

1551
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:59,199
was already in the water and so he took

1552
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,960
off like a bat out of you nowhere

1553
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:02,480
for the end of the pool and couldn't

1554
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,480
hear me and got to the end of the pool

1555
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,559
and it was a down and back

1556
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:09,039
well that's a hard thing to do with a

1557
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,440
guy with no body fat and so he burned a

1558
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:12,639
lot of energy and he come up on that end

1559
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:14,720
of the pool and he was like where's

1560
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:16,318
where's he actually didn't see me

1561
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,000
and so we stopped him and then he came

1562
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:19,759
back and then we went another one and i

1563
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:22,000
beat him

1564
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:23,920
but it's the only time that

1565
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,079
you know i wouldn't say that he was

1566
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:29,599
tuckered out and that's a reason why

1567
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:32,480
and i'll also say this we did a time

1568
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:35,039
where we timed my race

1569
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,440
the one i won

1570
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:38,480
and then we timed his first down to the

1571
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:41,200
wall

1572
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:42,639
and then we timed his the actual race

1573
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,358
where once he hit the wall we timed him

1574
00:53:42,639 --> 00:53:47,519
on the way back and he beat me

1575
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:50,480
now how's that for being a that's pretty

1576
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:52,318
honest that's pretty honest accountable

1577
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,440

1578
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:55,199

a thing that terry got the better of you

1585
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:10,160
i mean i guess this could count as one

1586
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:12,239
uh that you're still really bitter about

1587
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:14,639

the art of living is more like wrestling

1605
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:52,239
