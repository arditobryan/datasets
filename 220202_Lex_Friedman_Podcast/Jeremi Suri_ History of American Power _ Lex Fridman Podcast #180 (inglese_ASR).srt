are on modern american history with an

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,000
eye towards presidents

7
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:15,120
and in general individuals who wielded

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,839
power

9
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,800

as a side note let me say that in these

15
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:34,320
conversations for better or worse

16
00:00:31,278 --> 00:00:38,079
i seek understanding not activism

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,640
i'm not left nor right i love ideas

18
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,920
not labels and most fascinating ideas

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,640
are full of uncertainty

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,359
tension and trade-offs labels destroy

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,840
that

22
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:49,200
i try ideas out let them breathe for

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,079
time try to challenge

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,039
explore and analyze but mostly i trust

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,759
the intelligence

26
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
of you the listener to think and to make

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:00,000
up your own mind

28
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:02,558
together with me i will try to have

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,520
economists and philosophers on from all

30
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:05,920
points on the

31
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,840
multi-dimensional political spectrum

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,159
including the extremes

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,478
i will try to both have an open mind and

34
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,799
to ask difficult questions when needed

35
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,799
i'll make mistakes don't shoot this

36
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,118
robot at the first sign of failure

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,280
i'm still under development pre-release

38
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,519
version 0.1

39
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,000
this is the lex friedman podcast and

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:29,199
here is my conversation with jeremy

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,959
sorry you've studied many american

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,439
presidents throughout history

43
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,399
so who do you think was the greatest

44
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:36,399
president

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,118
in american history the greatest

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:41,520
american president was abraham lincoln

47
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:42,159
uh tolstoy reflected on this himself

48
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:43,920
actually

49
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,159
uh saying that when he was in the

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,200
caucasus he asked these

51
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,640
um peasants in the caucuses who was the

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,159
greatest man in the world that they

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,478
had heard of and they said abraham

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,040
lincoln and why

55
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:58,718
well because he gave voice to people who

56
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
had no voice before

57
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,640
he turned politics into an art this is

58
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
what tolstoy recounted the peasants and

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,718
the caucuses telling him

60
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,000
uh lincoln made politics more than about

61
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:10,639
power he made it an

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,239
art he made it a source of liberation

63
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,119
and those living even far from the

64
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,400
united states

65
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,599
could see that model that inspiration

66
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,280
from lincoln he was a man who had two

67
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,560
years of education yet he mastered the

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,598
english language

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,280
and he used the language to

70
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,280
help people imagine a different kind of

71
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,318
world you see leaders and presidents are

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,759
at their best

73
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:33,839
when they're doing more than just

74
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:35,679
manipulating institutions in power

75
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,000
when they're helping the people imagine

76
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,959
a better world and he did that

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,439
as no other president has and you say he

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,280
gave

79
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:45,519
he gave voice to those who are voiceless

80
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,800
uh who are you talking to

81
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:48,959
about in general is this about

82
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,120
african-americans or is this about

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,159
just the populist in general certainly

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,280
part of it is about

85
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:57,759
uh slaves uh african-americans and many

86
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,439
immigrants immigrants from all parts of

87
00:02:57,759 --> 00:03:00,639
europe and other areas that have come to

88
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:02,158
the united states

89
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:04,399
but part of it was just for ordinary

90
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,598
american citizens the republican party

91
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
for which lincoln was the first

92
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,598
president was a party created to give

93
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,719
voice to

94
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,518
poor white men as well as slaves and

95
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:15,759
others

96
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,680
and lincoln was a poor white man himself

97
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,919
grew up without slaves and without land

98
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
which meant you had almost nothing

99
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:22,958
what do you think about the trajectory

100
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
of that man with only two years of

101
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,719
education

102
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,000
is there something to be said about how

103
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:30,959
does one come from

104
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,959
nothing and

105
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,000
nurture the ideals that kind of make

106
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,239
this country great

107
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,680
into something where you can actually be

108
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,400
a leader of this nation

109
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,519
to espouse those ideas to give the voice

110
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,519
to the voiceless

111
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,519
yes i think i think you actually hit the

112
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,480
nail on the head i think

113
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,759
what he represented was the opportunity

114
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:52,079
and that was the word that mattered for

115
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,798
him

116
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,280
opportunity that came from the ability

117
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,480
to

118
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,479
raise yourself up to work hard and to be

119
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,238
compensated for your hard work and this

120
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:04,158
is at the core of the republican party

121
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,158
of the 19th century which is

122
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:07,919
the core of capitalism it's not about

123
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,280
getting rich it's about getting

124
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,798
compensated for your work

125
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,799
it's about being incentivized to do

126
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,080
better work and lincoln was constantly

127
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,120
striving one of his

128
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,959
closest associates uh herndon said

129
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,959
he was the little engine of ambition

130
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,680
that couldn't stop he just just kept

131
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,600
going

132
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,040
taught himself to read taught himself to

133
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,479
be a lawyer he went through many failed

134
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,040
businesses before he even reached that

135
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,000
point

136
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,360
many failed love affairs but he kept

137
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,279
trying he kept working

138
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,720
and what american society offered him

139
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:35,839
and what he wanted american society to

140
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,080
offer everyone else

141
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,519
was the opportunity to keep trying to

142
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,199
fail and then get up

143
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,959
and try again what do you think was the

144
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,079
nature of that ambition was there a

145
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:46,638
hunger for power

146
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,079
i think lincoln had a hunger for success

147
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,680
i think he had a hunger

148
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:52,240
to um get out of the poor station he was

149
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,478
in

150
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,000
he had a hunger to be someone who had

151
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,478
control over his life

152
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,319
freedom for him did not mean the right

153
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,639
to do anything you want to do

154
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,038
but it meant the right to be secure from

155
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,439
being dependent upon someone else

156
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:09,360
so independence uh he writes in his

157
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,680
letters when he's very young that he

158
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
hated being dependent on his father he

159
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,519
grew up without a mother

160
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,800
his father was a struggling farmer and

161
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:18,560
he would write in his letters that his

162
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,199
father treated him like a slave on the

163
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,038
farm

164
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,478
some think his hatred of slavery came

165
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,159
from that experience

166
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:26,240
he didn't ever want to have to work for

167
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
someone again he wanted to be free and

168
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,639
independent and he wanted again every

169
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,319
american this is the kind of

170
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,160
jeffersonian dream

171
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,839
to be the owner of themself and the

172
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,360
owner of their future

173
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,119
you know that's a really nice definition

174
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,120
of freedom we often think

175
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,360
kind of this very abstract notion of

176
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,120
being able to do anything you want

177
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,000
but really it's ultimately breaking

178
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,038
yourself free from the the constraints

179
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
like the very tight dependence on

180
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,918
whether it's

181
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,560
the institutions or on your family

182
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,359
or the expectations or the community or

183
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,199
whatever

184
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,800
be able to be to realize yourself

185
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,400
within the constraints of your own

186
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,400
abilities it's still not

187
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,439
true freedom because true freedom is

188
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,359
probably sort of

189
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,879
uh almost like designing a video game

190
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,600
character or something like that

191
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,519
i agree i think uh i think it's exactly

192
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,120
right i think freedom is not

193
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:20,799
uh that i can have any outcome i want i

194
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,079
can't control outcomes the most powerful

195
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,280
freeze person in the world cannot

196
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:24,719
control outcomes

197
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:26,239
but it means at least i get to make

198
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,880
choices someone else doesn't make those

199
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,160
choices for me

200
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,000
is there something to be said about

201
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,919
lincoln and

202
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,319
on the political game front of it

203
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,279
which is he's accomplished some of them

204
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,199
i i don't know

205
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,559
but it seems like there was some tricky

206
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,000
politics going on

207
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,759
we tend to not think of it in those

208
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,959
terms because of

209
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,560
the dark aspects of slavery we tend to

210
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,680
think about it in sort of ethical and

211
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,680
human terms

212
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:58,959
but in in their time it was probably

213
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,918
as much a game of politics not just

214
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,079
these broad

215
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:03,038
questions of human nature right it was

216
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,639
it was a game

217
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,318
so is there something to be said about

218
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,280
being a skillful player in the game of

219
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,598
politics that

220
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,679
you'd take from lincoln absolutely and

221
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,719
um lincoln never read carl von

222
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,720
clausewitz the great

223
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,080
19th century german thinker on strategy

224
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,440
and politics but but he

225
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,038
embodied the same wisdom which is that

226
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,399
everything is politics if you want to

227
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:22,879
get anything done

228
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,758
uh and this includes even relationships

229
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,120
uh

230
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,360
there's a politics to it what does that

231
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,399
mean it means that you you have to

232
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,479
persuade

233
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:32,318
coerce encourage people to do things

234
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,478
they wouldn't otherwise do

235
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,080
and lincoln lincoln was a master at that

236
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:37,598
he was a master that for two reasons he

237
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:38,560
had learned through his hard life to

238
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:40,478
read people

239
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,639
to anticipate them to spend a lot of

240
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,360
time listening one thing i often tell

241
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,439
people is the best leaders are the

242
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,000
listeners not the talkers

243
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,519
and then second um lincoln was very

244
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,439
thoughtful and planned

245
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,279
every move out he was thinking three or

246
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,319
four moves maybe five moves down the

247
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:59,038
chess board

248
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,560
while others were move number one or two

249
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,439
that's fascinating to think

250
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,639
about him just listening to studying

251
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:06,399
that's uh you know

252
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,400
they they look at great fighters in this

253
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,719
way like the first few rounds of boxing

254
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:11,120
and

255
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,720
mixed martial arts you're studying the

256
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,598
movement of your opponent

257
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,400
and in order to sort of uh to find the

258
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:17,839
holes

259
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:20,079
that's that's a really interesting frame

260
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,758
to think about it is there

261
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:26,878
in terms of relationships

262
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:29,520
where do you think as president or

263
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,919
as a politician is the most impact to be

264
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:31,680
had

265
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,038
i've been reading a lot about hitler

266
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,639
recently

267
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:37,598
and one of the things that i'm more and

268
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:40,559
more i'm starting to wonder

269
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,200
what the hell did he do alone in a room

270
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,000
with a

271
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,680
one-on-one with people because it seems

272
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,720
like that's where he was exceptionally

273
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,239
effective

274
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,320
when i when i think about certain

275
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,320
leaders

276
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,480
i'm not sure stalin was this way i

277
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,600
apologize been very obsessed with these

278
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:59,519
with this period of human history uh

279
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,839
it just seems like certain leaders are

280
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,320
extremely effective one-on-one

281
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,880
a lot of people think of hitler even in

282
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,200
lincoln

283
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,559
as a speech maker as a great charismatic

284
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,720
speech maker

285
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:12,319
but it seems like to me that some of

286
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,120
these guys were

287
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,760
really effective inside a room and what

288
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,240
do you think

289
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,559
what's more important your effectiveness

290
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,759
to uh

291
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,159
to make a hell of a good speech sort of

292
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:26,720
being

293
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:29,199
in a room with many people or is it all

294
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,278
boiled down to one-on-one

295
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,800
well i think in a sense it's both one

296
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,720
needs to do both and most

297
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:36,319
politicians most leaders are better at

298
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,120
one or the other it's the rare leader

299
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,839
who can do

300
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,320
both i will say that if you are going to

301
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,760
be

302
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:46,160
a figure who's a president or the leader

303
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,600
of a complex organization not a startup

304
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,439
but a complex organization where you

305
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,080
have many different constituencies and

306
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,080
many different

307
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
interests uh you have to do the

308
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,360
one-on-one really well

309
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,560
because a lot of what's going to happen

310
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,320
is you're going to be meeting with

311
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,879
people who represent different groups

312
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,040
right the

313
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,200
leader of the labor union the leader of

314
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,039
your investing board etc

315
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,720
and you have to be able to persuade them

316
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:07,759
and it's the intangibles that often

317
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,200
matter most

318
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,799
lincoln's skill and it's the same that

319
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,120
fdr had um

320
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,639
uh is the ability to tell a story i

321
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,039
think hitler was a little different uh

322
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,879
but

323
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,039
i'm what i've read of stalin is he was a

324
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:21,439
storyteller too one-on-one storytelling

325
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,278
yeah that's my understanding is that he

326
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,959
he and and what lincoln did i don't want

327
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:25,838
to compare lincoln to style what lincoln

328
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,919
did

329
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:32,240
uh is he he was not confrontational

330
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,679
uh he was happy to have an argument if

331
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,159
an argument were to be had but

332
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:36,799
actually what he would try to do is move

333
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,360
you

334
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:40,958
through telling a story that got you to

335
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,039
think about your position in a different

336
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,639
way to basically disarm you

337
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,078
and frankly roosevelt did the same thing

338
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:46,958
ronald reagan did the same thing

339
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:49,759
storytelling

340
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,879
is a very important skill it's almost

341
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,759
heartbreaking that

342
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,480
we don't get to have or maybe you can

343
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,639
correct me

344
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,320
if i'm wrong on this but it feels like

345
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,519
we don't have a lot of information how

346
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,879
all of these folks were

347
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,720
in private one-on-one conversations

348
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:09,838
even if we get like stories about it

349
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,600
it's like again sorry to bring up hitler

350
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,160
but

351
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,320
like uh people have talked about his uh

352
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:18,078
piercing gays when they're one-on-one

353
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,360
like there's a feeling like he's just

354
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:21,278
looking through you

355
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,120
i wonder like it makes me wonder it was

356
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,399
lincoln somebody who's a little bit more

357
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,600
passive

358
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,278
like who's more the ego doesn't shine

359
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,360
it's not like an overwhelming thing or

360
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,958
is it more like um

361
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,800
again don't want to bring up

362
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:37,199
controversial figures but uh donald

363
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:38,879
trump where it's more uh menacing

364
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,959
right there's a more like physically

365
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,360
menacing thing where it's almost like a

366
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,439
almost like a bullying kind of uh

367
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,000
dynamic so i wonder

368
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
you know i wish i wish we knew i wish

369
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,559
because

370
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,559
from a psychological perspective i

371
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,119
wonder if there's a thread that connects

372
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:56,319
most great leaders great question um so

373
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,399
i think the best

374
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,440
writer on this is max weber right and he

375
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,958
talks about the

376
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,120
the power of charisma that the term

377
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,719
charisma comes from weber right and

378
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
weber's use of it actually to talk about

379
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,959
prophets and i think he has a point

380
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,639
right uh leaders who are effective in

381
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:13,518
the way you describe

382
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,120
are leaders who feel prophetic or weber

383
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,679
says they have a kind of magic about

384
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,039
them

385
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:18,799
and i think that can come from different

386
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,559
sources i think that can come

387
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:22,078
that can come from the way someone

388
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:23,518
carries themselves it can come from the

389
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,359
way they use words

390
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,839
um so maybe there are different kinds of

391
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,560
magic that that that someone develops

392
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,160
but i think there

393
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:32,078
are two things that that seem to be

394
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:33,759
absolutely necessary first is you have

395
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:34,879
to be someone who sizes up the person on

396
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:36,399
the other side of the table

397
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,720
you cannot be the person who just comes

398
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,078
in and reads your brief

399
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,320
and then second i think it's interactive

400
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,919
and there is a quickness of thought so

401
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,360
you brought up donald trump i don't

402
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,679
think donald trump is a deep thinker at

403
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,320
all

404
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,039
but he's quick and i think that

405
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,879
quickness

406
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,159
is part of it's different from from

407
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:55,919
delivering a lecture where it's the

408
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:57,679
depth of your thought can you for 45

409
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,679
minutes analyze something

410
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,199
many people can't do that but they still

411
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:04,000
might be very effective

412
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
if they're able to quickly react size up

413
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,360
the person on the other side of the

414
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,839
table and react in a way that moves that

415
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,959
person in the way they want to move them

416
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,240
yeah and there's also just a coupled

417
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,278
with the quickness as a kind of

418
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:20,240
instinct about human nature yes

419
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:22,320
sort of asking the question what does

420
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,919
this person worry about

421
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,440
what is it what are the biggest problems

422
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,120
somebody uh

423
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,920
what is this steven schwartzman i think

424
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,240
said to me he's this businessman

425
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:33,039
i think he said like what i've always

426
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,399
tried to do

427
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,919
is try to figure out like ask enough

428
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,399
questions to figure out what is the

429
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,278
biggest

430
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,639
problem in this person's life try to get

431
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,278
a sense of what is the biggest problem

432
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,560
in their life

433
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:46,720
because that's actually what they care

434
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:47,359
about most and most people don't care

435
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,040
enough to

436
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,839
find out and so he kind of wants to

437
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,360
sneak up on that right and and find that

438
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,240
and then

439
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,079
use that to then build closeness in

440
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,000
order to then probably he doesn't put in

441
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:03,919
those words but to manipulate the person

442
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,240
into whatever to do whatever the heck

443
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:08,719
they want and i think

444
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,519
i i think part of it uh part of it is

445
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,680
that and part of

446
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,159
the effectiveness donald trump has is

447
00:14:11,679 --> 00:14:16,799
how quick he's able to figure that out

448
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:17,278
you've uh written a book about how the

449
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:19,838
role

450
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,278
and power of the presidency has changed

451
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,839
so

452
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:25,439
has how has it changed since lincoln's

453
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,600
time

454
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,000
the evolution of the presidency as a

455
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,240
concept which seems like a fascinating

456
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,198
lens through which to look at american

457
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,079
history sure

458
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:37,759
as a president you know we seem to only

459
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,239
be talking about the presidents

460
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,120
maybe a general here and there but it's

461
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,519
mostly the

462
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,480
the story of america is often told

463
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,879
through

464
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,639
presidents that's right that's right and

465
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:51,360
one of the points i've tried to make

466
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,720
in my writing about this and and various

467
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,320
other activities is

468
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,399
we use this word president as if it's

469
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,360
something timeless but the office has

470
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,759
changed

471
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,959
incredibly just in link from lincoln's

472
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,319
time to the present which is you know

473
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,719
150 years

474
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,480
he wouldn't recognize the office uh

475
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,399
today and george washington would not

476
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,959
have recognized it in lincoln

477
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,480
just as i think a ceo today would be

478
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,759
unrecognizable

479
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,560
to a rockefeller or a carnegie of 150

480
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,838
years ago

481
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,439
so what are some of the ways in which

482
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,240
the office has changed i'll just point

483
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
to three there are

484
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,759
a lot uh one uh presidents now can

485
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,759
communicate

486
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:27,198
with the public directly i mean we've

487
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:28,958
reached the point now where president

488
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,120
can have direct almost one-on-one

489
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,278
communication president can use twitter

490
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,639
if he so chooses to circumvent

491
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,320
all media that was unthinkable lincoln

492
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,799
in order to get his message across

493
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,240
often wrote letters to newspapers and

494
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,599
waited for the newspaper for horus

495
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,079
greeley in the new york tribune to

496
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,600
publish

497
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,039
uh his letter that's how he communicated

498
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,800
with the public there weren't even many

499
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:49,759
speaking opportunities so that's a big

500
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,919
change right

501
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:54,320
we feel the president in our life much

502
00:15:51,919 --> 00:15:55,039
more that's why we talk about him much

503
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,160
more

504
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:57,599
that also creates more of a burden

505
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,360
that's the second point presidents are

506
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,879
under a microscope

507
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,240
presidents are under a microscope you

508
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:04,078
have to be very careful what you do and

509
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,799
what you say and you're judged by a lot

510
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:06,958
of the

511
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,559
elements of your behavior that are not

512
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,399
policy relevant in fact the things we

513
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,319
judge most and make most of our

514
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,679
decisions on about individuals are often

515
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,199
that uh and then

516
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,278
third um the power the president has

517
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:21,039
um it's it's inhuman actually and this

518
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:22,958
is one of my critiques of how the office

519
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:24,958
has changed this one person

520
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,198
has power on a scale that's that's i

521
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:31,278
think dangerous in a democracy

522
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:32,639
and certainly something the founders 220

523
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,320
years ago would have had trouble

524
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,680
conceiving um

525
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,920
presidents now have the ability to

526
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:39,679
deliver force across the world to

527
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,519
to literally assassinate people with a

528
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,439
remarkable accuracy

529
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,320
uh and that's an enormous power that

530
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:49,120
presidents have so your sense

531
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,480
this is not to get conspiratorial but do

532
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,198
you think

533
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:58,079
a president currently has the power to

534
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,039
you know initiate the assassination of

535
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,078
somebody

536
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:04,318
of a political um enemy

537
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:05,359
or like a terrorist leader or that kind

538
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,678
of thing to

539
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,479
to frame that person in a way where

540
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,480
assassination is something that he alone

541
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,838
or she alone could decide to do i think

542
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,439
it happens all the time and it's not to

543
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:16,958
be conspiratorial this is how we fought

544
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,519
terrorism

545
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,120
by uh targeting individuals now you

546
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,480
might say these were not elected leaders

547
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,000
of state but these were individuals with

548
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,519
a large following i mean the killing of

549
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,798
osama bin laden

550
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:30,839
was was an assassination uh operation um

551
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,119
and we've we've taken out very

552
00:17:30,839 --> 00:17:34,159
successfully many leaders of terrorist

553
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:36,159
organizations and

554
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,840
and we do it every day you're saying

555
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,679
that back in lincoln's time or george

556
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,038
washington's time there was more of a

557
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,798
balance of power like

558
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,480
a president could not initiate this kind

559
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:47,038
of assassination correct i think

560
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,079
presidents did not have the same kind of

561
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:49,759
military

562
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,678
or economic power we could talk about

563
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:54,400
how a president can influence a market

564
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,880
right by saying something pretty about

565
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,759
uh

566
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,440
where uh money is going to go or uh

567
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,038
singling out a company or critiquing a

568
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
company in one way or another

569
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:04,480
they didn't have that kind of power now

570
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,960
much of the power that a lincoln or

571
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,880
a washington had was the power to

572
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,600
mobilize people to then make their own

573
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,760
decisions

574
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:12,879
at the start of the civil war lincoln

575
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:14,480
doesn't even have the power to bring

576
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
people into the army he has to go to the

577
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,679
governors

578
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,519
and ask the governors to provide

579
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:20,960
soldiers so the governor of wisconsin

580
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,759
the governor of massachusetts could you

581
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,759
imagine that today

582
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,640
so but yeah so they used speeches and

583
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,119
words to mobilize

584
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,640
versus direct action in closed-door

585
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:36,879
environments

586
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,880
initiating wars for example correct

587
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,640
it's difficult to think about if we look

588
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:45,840
at barack obama for example

589
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,840
this if you're listening to this and

590
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,199
you're on the left or the right

591
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:51,439
please do not make this political in

592
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,120
fact if you're a political person

593
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,038
and you're getting angry at the mention

594
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,079
of the word obama or donald trump

595
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,519
please turn off this podcast we're not

596
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,519
going to get very far

597
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,798
i hope we maintain a political

598
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,160
discussion about

599
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:07,519
even the modern presidents that uh

600
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,960
view through the lens of history i think

601
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,000
there's a lot to be learned through

602
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,960
about

603
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,240
about the office and about human nature

604
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,319
some people criticize

605
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,359
barack obama for for sort of uh

606
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,000
expanding the

607
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:20,639
the military-industrial complex engaging

608
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,519
in more

609
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,160
and more wars as opposed to sort of the

610
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,960
initial

611
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,679
rhetoric was such that we would pull

612
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,880
back

613
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,919
uh from sort of be more skeptical in our

614
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,520
decisions to

615
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:36,720
wage wars so from the lens of the power

616
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:40,079
of the presidency

617
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,919
as the modern presidency the fact that

618
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,000
we continued the war in afghanistan and

619
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,400
different engagements

620
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:52,240
in military conflicts do you think

621
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:54,720
barack obama could have stopped that

622
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,079
do you put the responsibility on that

623
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,160
expansion on

624
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:59,599
him because of the implied power that

625
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,159
the presidency has

626
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,480
or is this power just sits there and if

627
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:07,200
a president chooses to take it they do

628
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,240
and if they don't they don't almost like

629
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,319
you don't want to

630
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
get take on the responsibility because

631
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:15,519
of the the burden of that responsibility

632
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,600
so a lot of my research is about this

633
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,279
exact question not just with obama

634
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,119
and my conclusion and i think the

635
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,440
research is pretty clear on this is that

636
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,798
structure has a lot more effect on us

637
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,640
than we like to admit

638
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:28,639
which is to say that the circumstances

639
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,440
the institutions around us drive our

640
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,960
behavior

641
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,480
more than we like to think so barack

642
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,919
obama i'm quite certain

643
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,400
came into the office of the presidency

644
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:38,320
committed to actually reducing the use

645
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:40,400
of military force overseas and reducing

646
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,558
presidential war-making power

647
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,400
uh as a trained lawyer he had a moral

648
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:46,319
position on this actually

649
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,919
and he tried and and he did withdraw

650
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:49,519
american forces from iraq and was of

651
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,480
course criticized by many people for

652
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,158
doing that

653
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,679
but at the same time he had some real

654
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,080
problems in the world to deal with

655
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,440
terrorism being one of them and the

656
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,678
tools he has

657
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,880
are very much biased towards the use of

658
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,798
military force

659
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,039
it's much harder as president to go and

660
00:21:02,798 --> 00:21:06,158
get vladimir putin and xi jinping to

661
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,798
agree with you

662
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,480
it's much easier to send these wonderful

663
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:11,119
toys we have and these incredible

664
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,279
soldiers

665
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,678
we have over there and when you have

666
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,519
congress which is always against you

667
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,200
it's also easier to use the military

668
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,879
because you send them there and even if

669
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,679
members of congress from your own party

670
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,600
or the other

671
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,440
are angry at you they'll still fund the

672
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,759
soldiers no member of congress wants to

673
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,919
vote

674
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,200
to starve our soldiers overseas so

675
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,038
they'll stop your budget they'll even

676
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,120
threaten not to pay the debt

677
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:35,679
but they'll still fund your soldiers and

678
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:36,798
so you are pushed by the circumstances

679
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,759
you're in

680
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,319
to do this and it's very hard to resist

681
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:42,640
so that's

682
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:44,319
i think the criticism of obama the fair

683
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,960
one would be that he didn't resist the

684
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,558
pressures

685
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,000
that were there but he did not make

686
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,200
those pressures so

687
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,079
is there something about the putting the

688
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,880
responsibility on the president to

689
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:58,480
to form the structure around him locally

690
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,880
such that he can

691
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,480
make the policy that the that matches

692
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,520
the rhetoric so

693
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,079
what i'm talking to is hiring

694
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:08,639
so basically just everybody you work

695
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,359
with

696
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,880
you have power as a president to to fire

697
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,000
and hire or to

698
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,880
to basically schedule meetings in such a

699
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,240
way that

700
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:23,039
can control your decision making so

701
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,279
i imagine it's very difficult to to uh

702
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:28,480
get out of afghanistan or iraq

703
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:30,079
when most of your scheduled meetings are

704
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,599
with generals

705
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,199
or something like that but if you

706
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,839
reorganize the schedule

707
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,600
yes and you reorganize who you have like

708
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:39,759
late night talks with

709
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:40,798
you potentially have a huge ripple

710
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:42,558
effect on the

711
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:44,400
on the policy i think that's right i

712
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,678
think uh who has access to the president

713
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,440
is absolutely crucial

714
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,440
and presidents have to be more strategic

715
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,240
about that they tend to be reacting to

716
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,159
crises

717
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,200
because every day has a crisis yeah and

718
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,559
if you're reacting to a crisis you're

719
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,159
not controlling access because the

720
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:58,000
crisis is driving you

721
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,280
so that's one element of it but i also

722
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,079
think and this is the moment we're in

723
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,798
right now

724
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:04,000
presidents have to invest in reforming

725
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:06,079
the system

726
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,759
the system of decision making should we

727
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,480
have a national security council that

728
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,319
looks the way

729
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,759
it does should our military be

730
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,759
structured the way it is the the

731
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,000
founding fathers wanted a military that

732
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,279
was divided they did not want a unified

733
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,038
department of defense that was only

734
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,480
created after world war ii

735
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,879
should we have as large a military as we

736
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,640
have should we be in as many places

737
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,640
there are some fundamental structural

738
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,159
reforms we have to undertake

739
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,759
and part of that is who you appoint but

740
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,480
part of that is also how you change the

741
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,319
institutions

742
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,079
the genius of the american system is

743
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,558
that it's a dynamic system

744
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,000
it can be adjusted it has been adjusted

745
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,440
over time that's the

746
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:43,839
heroic story the the frustrating story

747
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,360
is it often takes us a long time to make

748
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,278
those adjustments until we go

749
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,719
into such bad circumstances that we have

750
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:52,159
no choice

751
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,319
so in the battle of power of the

752
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,400
office of the president versus the

753
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,960
united states military

754
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,038
the department of defense do you have a

755
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,798
sense that the president has more power

756
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:06,640
ultimately so to decrease the size of

757
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,558
the department of defense to withdraw

758
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,440
from any wars

759
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,798
or increase the amount of wars is the

760
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,400
president

761
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,558
you're kind of implying the president

762
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,320
has a lot of power here in this scale

763
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,240
yes the president has a lot of power and

764
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:21,439
we are fortunate and it was just proven

765
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,319
in the last few years

766
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,080
that our military uniquely among many

767
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:27,918
countries with large militaries

768
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,519
is very deferential to the president and

769
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,360
very restricted in its ability to

770
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,839
challenge the president

771
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:36,240
so that's a strength of our system but

772
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,240
the way you reform the military is not

773
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,000
with individual decisions it's by

774
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,278
by having a strategic plan that

775
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,480
re-examines what role it plays so it's

776
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,159
not just about whether we're in

777
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,360
afghanistan or not the question we have

778
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,120
to ask is

779
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,439
when we look at our toolbox of what we

780
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:54,798
can do in our foreign policy

781
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,798
are there other tools we should build up

782
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:57,839
and therefore some tools in the military

783
00:24:56,798 --> 00:25:00,158
we should reduce

784
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:01,439
that's the broader strategic question

785
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,679
let me ask you the most

786
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,480
absurd question of all that you did not

787
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,480
sign up for

788
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,240
but it's especially i've been hanging

789
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,558
out with a guy named joe rogan recently

790
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,480
sure so it's very important um

791
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,798
for from for me and him to figure this

792
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,079
out if a president

793
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,759
because you said you implied the

794
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,119
president is very powerful if a

795
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:21,278
president shows up

796
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,719
and and the u.s government is in fact in

797
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:26,480
possession of aliens

798
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:29,038
alien spacecraft do you think

799
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,480
the president will be told a more

800
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,759
responsible adult

801
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:37,038
historian question version of that is uh

802
00:25:33,759 --> 00:25:38,798
is there some things that the machine of

803
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:40,879
government keeps

804
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:42,558
secret from the president or is the

805
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,320
president ultimately at the very center

806
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,720
so if you like map out

807
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,399
the set of information and power you

808
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,159
have like cia you have all these

809
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:53,679
organizations that like

810
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:55,840
that do the the machinery of government

811
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,880
not just like the passing of bills but

812
00:25:55,839 --> 00:26:01,199
like

813
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,480
uh gaining information homeland security

814
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,880
uh actually like engaging in wars

815
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,599
you know all those kinds of things uh

816
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,360
how

817
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:11,278
central is the president would the

818
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:14,000
president know some of the shady things

819
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:17,119
that are going on

820
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,679
aliens or some kind of

821
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:21,278
cyber security stuff against russia and

822
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,679
china all those kinds of things

823
00:26:21,278 --> 00:26:24,720
is the president really made aware and

824
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,440
how if so

825
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,120
how nervous does that make you so um

826
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,320
presidents like leaders of any complex

827
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,719
organizations

828
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:34,000
uh don't know everything that goes on uh

829
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,440
they have to ask the right questions

830
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,558
this is machiavelli

831
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,240
most important thing a leader has to do

832
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:41,678
is ask the right questions you don't

833
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,839
have to know the answers

834
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,278
that's why you hire smart people but you

835
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:48,000
have to ask the right questions

836
00:26:45,278 --> 00:26:49,519
so if the president asks the u.s

837
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,240
government those who are responsible for

838
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:53,519
the aliens are responsible for the cyber

839
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,960
warfare against russia

840
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,839
they will answer honestly they will have

841
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,640
to but they will not volunteer that

842
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,879
information

843
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,559
in all cases so the best way a president

844
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,360
can operate is to have people

845
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,960
around him or her who are not the

846
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,359
traditional policy makers this is where

847
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,519
i think

848
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,439
academic experts are important

849
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,918
suggesting questions

850
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,640
to ask to therefore try to get the

851
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,679
information

852
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,600
it makes me nervous because i think

853
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,120
human nature is such that

854
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:25,599
the the academics the experts

855
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,119
everybody is almost afraid to ask the

856
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:30,639
questions

857
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:30,639
for which the answers might

858
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:36,879
be burdensome and so that's right

859
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,558
and you can get into a lot of trouble

860
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,799
not asking it's the old

861
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:45,359
elephant in the room correct correct

862
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:46,558
this is exactly right and too often

863
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,719
mediocre leaders

864
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:50,240
and those who try to protect them try to

865
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,360
shield themselves they don't want to

866
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,519
know certain things

867
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:55,519
so this is part of what happened with

868
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,839
the use of torture by the united states

869
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,398
which is a war crime

870
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:01,119
during the war on terror president bush

871
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:02,959
at times

872
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,879
intentionally did not ask and people

873
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,480
around him prevented him from asking or

874
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,520
discouraged him from asking questions he

875
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,079
should have asked

876
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,440
to know about what was going on and

877
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:12,879
that's how we ended up

878
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,278
where we did you could say the same

879
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,520
thing about reagan and iran contra

880
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:18,398
i wonder what it takes to be the kind of

881
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,319
leader

882
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:21,759
that steps in and asks some difficult

883
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:25,599
questions so

884
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:28,240
aliens is one ufo spacecraft right

885
00:28:25,599 --> 00:28:29,519
another one yeah torture is another one

886
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,038
the cia

887
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:32,558
how much information is being collected

888
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:34,798
about americans

889
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,960
i can see as a president being very

890
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,720
uncomfortable asking that question

891
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,399
because if the answer is a lot of

892
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,440
information is being collected by

893
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:46,479
of americans then you have to be the guy

894
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,679
who's lives with that information for

895
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,480
the rest of your life

896
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:52,159
you have to walk around you're probably

897
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,759
not going to

898
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,200
reform that system it's very difficult

899
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:56,960
you have to you probably have to be very

900
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,120
picky about which things you reform

901
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,519
you don't have much time it takes a lot

902
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:03,519
of sort of effort to restructure things

903
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,839
but you nevertheless would have to be

904
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:09,038
basically lying

905
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:11,439
to uh to the you know to to

906
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:13,038
to yourself to others around you about

907
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,679
the unethical things

908
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,960
depends of course what your ethical

909
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:19,038
system is

910
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,240
i wonder what it takes to ask those hard

911
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,679
questions

912
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:26,480
i wonder if how few of us

913
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:28,559
are can be great leaders like that and i

914
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:32,000
wonder if our political system

915
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:33,839
the electoral system such that

916
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,519
makes it likely that such leaders will

917
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,959
come to power

918
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,960
it's hard and you can't ask all the

919
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,240
right questions and there is a legal

920
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,480
hazard if you know things

921
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,000
at certain times but i think you can

922
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,360
back to your point on hiring you can

923
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,480
hire people who will do that in their

924
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:47,839
domains

925
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,200
and then you have to trust that when

926
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:50,639
they think it's something that's a

927
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,080
question you need to ask they'll pass

928
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,919
that on to you

929
00:29:52,079 --> 00:29:56,158
this is why it's not a good idea to have

930
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,840
loyalists because loyalists will shield

931
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,440
you from things it's a good idea to have

932
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,359
people of integrity

933
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,038
uh who you can rely on and who you think

934
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,158
will ask those right questions and then

935
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:06,798
pass that down through their

936
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,799
organization

937
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,799
what's inspiring to you what's

938
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:13,359
insightful to you about

939
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:14,798
several of the presidencies throughout

940
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:16,398
the recent decades

941
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:17,839
is there somebody that stands out to you

942
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:20,079
that's interesting

943
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,240
in in sort of in your study of how the

944
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:24,000
office has changed

945
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,839
well bill clinton is one of the most

946
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,759
fascinating figures why can't i

947
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,278
i apologize bill clinton just puts a

948
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,720
smile on my face every time somebody

949
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:31,278
mentions him at this point i don't know

950
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,759
why

951
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:34,640
he's it's charisma i suppose well and

952
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,440
he's uh he's

953
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,640
he's a unique individual but but uh he

954
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,038
um

955
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,159
he fascinates me uh because he's a

956
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:45,599
figure of such

957
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:49,039
enormous talent and enormous appetite

958
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:52,240
and such little self-control uh and such

959
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,359
er extremes uh and and i think it's not

960
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,480
just that he tells us something about

961
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,479
the presidency he tells us something

962
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,880
about our society uh you know american

963
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,399
society this is not new to our time

964
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,559
is filled with enormous enormous

965
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,359
reservoirs of talent and creativity

966
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,879
and those have a bright and a dark side

967
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,639
and you see both with bill clinton in

968
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,880
some ways he's the mirror

969
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,320
of the best and worst of our society and

970
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,840
maybe that's really what presidents are

971
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:14,480
in the end right they're mirrors of our

972
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,158
world

973
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,399
that we get the government we deserve we

974
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,840
get the leaders we deserve i wish we

975
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,518
embraced that a little bit more

976
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,199
you know a lot of people criticize you

977
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,880
know donald trump for certain

978
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,399
human qualities that he has a lot of

979
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:28,399
people criticize

980
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,319
bill clinton for certain human qualities

981
00:31:28,398 --> 00:31:31,278
i wish we kind of embraced the chaos of

982
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,678
that

983
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:35,278
you know because he he does you're right

984
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,480
in some sense represent

985
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:40,319
i mean he doesn't represent the greatest

986
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,720
ideal of america but

987
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,000
the flawed aspect of human nature is

988
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,360
what he represents and that's the

989
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,640
beautiful thing about america the

990
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,119
diversity

991
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,919
of this land with the the the mix of it

992
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,518
the the

993
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,159
the corruption of of within capitalism

994
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,839
the the beauty of capitalism the

995
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,799
innovation all those kinds of things the

996
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,439
people that

997
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:03,119
start from nothing and create everything

998
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,240
the elon musks of the world and the bill

999
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,038
gates and so on

1000
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,519
but also the people bernie madoff's and

1001
00:32:07,038 --> 00:32:09,440
and

1002
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:11,679
and all is the me too movie that showed

1003
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,960
the the multitude of creeps that

1004
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,919
apparently

1005
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,440
permeate the entirety of our system so i

1006
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,440
don't know there's something um

1007
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,559
there is some sense in which we put our

1008
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,599
president on a pedestal

1009
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:30,720
which actually creates

1010
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:33,439
a fake human being like we

1011
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,839
the the standard we hold them to is

1012
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,480
forcing the fake politicians to come to

1013
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:38,480
power

1014
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,798
versus the authentic one which is in

1015
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:44,159
some sense the promise of donald trump

1016
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:46,319
is uh a like it's a it's a definitive

1017
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,200
statement of authenticity

1018
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,319
it's like this the opposite of the fake

1019
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,000
politician

1020
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:53,359
it's whatever else you want to say about

1021
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,519
him is there's

1022
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,439
the the chaos that's unlike anything

1023
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,919
else that's uh came before

1024
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,600
one thing and this in particular may be

1025
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,519
preference and quirk of mine

1026
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,278
but i really admire maybe i'm

1027
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,519
romanticizing the past again

1028
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:11,038
but i romanticized the presidents that

1029
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:15,359
were students of history yeah

1030
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:18,079
they were almost like king philosophers

1031
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,119
you know great gr you know that made

1032
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,798
speeches

1033
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:24,158
that um you know reverberated through

1034
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:27,679
decades after

1035
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:29,278
right then we we kind of using the words

1036
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,480
of those presidents whether written by

1037
00:33:29,278 --> 00:33:34,159
them or not

1038
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,720
we tell the story of america and

1039
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:38,000
i don't know even obama has been an

1040
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,919
exceptionally good as far

1041
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,038
as i know i apologize if i'm incorrect

1042
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,038
on this but

1043
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:45,599
from everything i've seen he was a very

1044
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:49,038
deep scholar of history

1045
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:51,199
and i really admire that is that

1046
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,440
through the through the history of the

1047
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,000
office of the presidency

1048
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,840
is that just your own preference or is

1049
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,119
that supposed to come with a job

1050
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:01,119
are you supposed to be a student of

1051
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:02,558
history i think i mean i'm obviously

1052
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,678
biased as a historian but i do think it

1053
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,879
comes with a job

1054
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:09,679
every president i've studied uh

1055
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,639
had a serious interest in history now

1056
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,119
how they

1057
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,000
pursued that interest would vary uh

1058
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:16,960
obama was

1059
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,398
more bookish more academic so was george

1060
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,398
w bush in strange ways

1061
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:22,319
george h.w bush was less so but george

1062
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,319
h.w bush loved to talk to people so he

1063
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,679
would talk to historians right

1064
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,079
ronald reagan uh loved movies and movies

1065
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,079
were

1066
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,800
uh an insight into history for him he

1067
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:34,720
likes to watch movies about another time

1068
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,839
it wasn't always the best of history but

1069
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,678
he was interested

1070
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,199
in what is a fundamental historical

1071
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,119
question how has

1072
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,279
how has our society developed how has it

1073
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,320
grown and changed over time

1074
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:48,720
and how has that change affected who we

1075
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,480
are today that's the historical question

1076
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,239
it's really interesting to me i do a lot

1077
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,440
of work with business leaders and others

1078
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,759
too

1079
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:57,519
you reach a certain point in any career

1080
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,240
and you become a historian

1081
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:01,599
because you realize that the formulas

1082
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:02,000
and the technical knowledge that you've

1083
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,880
gained

1084
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,119
got you to where you are but now your

1085
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,280
decisions are about human nature

1086
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,880
your decisions are about social change

1087
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,200
and they can't be answered

1088
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,880
technically they can only be answered by

1089
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:16,399
studying human beings

1090
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,519
and what is history it's studying the

1091
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,838
laboratory of human behavior

1092
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,880
to sort of play devil's advocate i kind

1093
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:26,239
of

1094
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,680
especially in the engineering scientific

1095
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:31,118
domains

1096
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:33,598
i often see history holding us back

1097
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,358
instead of the way things were done in

1098
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,160
the past are not necessarily going to

1099
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,440
hold the key

1100
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:42,960
to what

1101
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,280
will progress us into the future

1102
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,199
of course with history in studying human

1103
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,880
nature it does seem like humans are just

1104
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,480
the same

1105
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,000
it's just like the same problems over

1106
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,559
and over so

1107
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,440
in that sense it feels like history has

1108
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:57,119
all the lessons

1109
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,639
whether we're talking about wars whether

1110
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,838
we're talking about corruption

1111
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:04,239
whether we're talking about economics

1112
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,480
i think there's a difference between um

1113
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:08,639
history and antiquarianism

1114
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,000
so antiquarianism which some people call

1115
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:12,000
history

1116
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,920
is the desire to go back to the past or

1117
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,358
stay stuck in the past so antiquarianism

1118
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,119
is the desire to have

1119
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,119
the desk that abraham lincoln sat at

1120
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,480
wouldn't it be cool to sit at his desk

1121
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,240
i'd love to have that desk if i had a

1122
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,800
few extra million dollars i'd acquire it

1123
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,519
right

1124
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,599
so in a way uh that's antiquarianism

1125
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,199
that's trying to capture and hold on

1126
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,000
hold on to the past the past is a

1127
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:34,879
talisman for antiquarians

1128
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,400
um what history is is the study of

1129
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,838
change over time that's the real

1130
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,480
definition of historical

1131
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:41,599
study and historical thinking and so

1132
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,838
what we're studying is

1133
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,960
change and so a historian should never

1134
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,799
say

1135
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,000
um we have to do things the way we've

1136
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,039
done them in the past the historians

1137
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,880
should say we can't

1138
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:52,960
do them the way we did them in the past

1139
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:55,280
we can't step in the same river twice

1140
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,079
every podcast of yours is different from

1141
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,680
the last one

1142
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:59,280
right you plan it out and then it goes

1143
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,480
in its own direction right

1144
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:03,920
yeah um and um what are we studying then

1145
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,599
in history we're studying

1146
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,000
the patterns of change and we're

1147
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:09,119
recognizing we're part of a pattern so

1148
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,559
what i would say to

1149
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,320
the historian who's trying to hold the

1150
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:14,639
engineer back i'd say no

1151
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,720
don't tell that engineer not to do this

1152
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,799
tell them to understand how this fits

1153
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:20,639
into the relationship with other

1154
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,240
engineering products and other

1155
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,400
activities from the past that still

1156
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,919
affect us today for example

1157
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,320
any product you produce is going to be

1158
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,079
used by human beings who have prejudices

1159
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,359
it's going to go into an unequal society

1160
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,880
don't assume it's going to go into an

1161
00:37:31,358 --> 00:37:34,480
equal society don't assume that when you

1162
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,079
create a social media site

1163
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,719
that people are going to use it fairly

1164
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,920
and put only truthful things on it

1165
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:41,838
we shouldn't be surprised that's where

1166
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,039
human nature comes in

1167
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:44,480
but it's not trying to hold on to the

1168
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,320
past it's trying to use the knowledge in

1169
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,838
the past to better inform the changes

1170
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,200
today

1171
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,759
i have to ask you about george

1172
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,639
washington it may be maybe you have some

1173
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,599
insights

1174
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,639
it seems like he's such a fascinating

1175
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,680
figure

1176
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:02,559
in the context of the study of power

1177
00:37:59,679 --> 00:38:03,118
because i kind of intuitively have come

1178
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,599
to

1179
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,039
internalize the belief that power

1180
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,359
corrupts and absolute power crops

1181
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:13,519
absolutely yes

1182
00:38:09,358 --> 00:38:16,719
and then and and sort of like

1183
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:18,800
basically in thinking that we have to we

1184
00:38:16,719 --> 00:38:20,639
cannot trust any one individual i can't

1185
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,880
trust myself with power i can't

1186
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,239
nobody can trust anybody with power we

1187
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,480
have to create institutions and

1188
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:29,118
structures that prevent us from

1189
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,679
ever being able to amass absolute power

1190
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,920
and yet

1191
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:32,960
here's a guy george washington who seems

1192
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,480
to

1193
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,720
you can correct me if i'm wrong but he

1194
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,719
seems to give away relinquished power

1195
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,000
uh it feels like george washington did

1196
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:43,118
it

1197
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,480
like almost like the purest of ways

1198
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,320
which is uh believes in this country

1199
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:50,000
but he just believes he's not the person

1200
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,599
to to uh

1201
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,599
to uh to carry it forward

1202
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,200
i wha what do you make of that what kind

1203
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,119
of human does it take to really

1204
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:00,879
to give away that power is there some

1205
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,519
hopeful message we can

1206
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,960
carry through to the future to to to

1207
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:08,239
elect leaders like that

1208
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,358
or to or to uh find friends to hang out

1209
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:10,879
with who are like that

1210
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:13,358
like what is that how do you explain

1211
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,800
that so it's uh it's actually the most

1212
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:16,719
important thing about george washington

1213
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,480
it's the right thing to to bring up

1214
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:22,159
um what uh the historian gary wills

1215
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,920
wrote years ago i'm going to quote him

1216
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,838
was that washington recognized that

1217
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,559
sometimes you get more power by giving

1218
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,119
it up

1219
00:39:26,559 --> 00:39:30,159
than by trying to hold on to every last

1220
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,920
piece of it

1221
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,920
uh washington gives up power at the end

1222
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,599
of the revolution he's successfully

1223
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,200
carried through the revolutionary war

1224
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:39,039
aims he's commander of the

1225
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:40,639
revolutionary forces and he gives up his

1226
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:42,320
command and then of course he's

1227
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:43,199
president and after two terms he gives

1228
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,960
up his command

1229
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,439
what is he doing he's an ambitious

1230
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,159
person but he's recognizing that

1231
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,200
the most important currency he has for

1232
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:53,759
power

1233
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:56,480
is his respected status as a

1234
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,720
disinterested statesman

1235
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,400
that's really what his power is and how

1236
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:04,239
does he further that power

1237
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,480
by showing that he doesn't crave power

1238
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,318
so he was self-aware very self-aware of

1239
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,358
this and very sophisticated in

1240
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:11,279
understanding

1241
00:40:09,358 --> 00:40:12,960
understanding this and and i think there

1242
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:17,119
are many other leaders who

1243
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:20,240
who recognize that um you can look to

1244
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,599
uh in some ways um the story of many of

1245
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:24,078
our presidents who

1246
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,559
even before there is a two-term limit in

1247
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,640
the constitution leave after two terms

1248
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,559
um they do that because they recognize

1249
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,799
that their power is the power of being a

1250
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:35,279
statesman

1251
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,720
not of being a president i still wonder

1252
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,319
what kind of man it takes

1253
00:40:36,719 --> 00:40:40,959
what kind of human being it takes to do

1254
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,838
that because i've been

1255
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,400
studying vladimir putin quite a bit

1256
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,639
right

1257
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:51,920
and he's still i believe

1258
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,400
he still has popular support that that's

1259
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,880
not

1260
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,720
fully manipulated because i know a lot

1261
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,160
of people in russia and actually

1262
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,959
almost the entirety of my family in

1263
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:03,598
russia are big supporters of putin

1264
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,358
and everybody i talk to sort of that's

1265
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,440
not just like on social media

1266
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:09,119
right like the people that live in

1267
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,240
russia seems to

1268
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:16,640
seem to support him it feels like

1269
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:19,679
this would be in a george washington way

1270
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:22,559
now would be the time that what putin

1271
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:25,759
just like yatsen could relinquish power

1272
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:28,719
and thereby in the eyes of russians

1273
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,520
become in in like the long arc of

1274
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:32,239
history

1275
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:34,318
be viewed as a great leader you look at

1276
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,078
the economic growth of russia

1277
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:37,759
you look at the rescue from the collapse

1278
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,680
of the soviet union and russia

1279
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,359
finding its footing and then

1280
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:44,559
relinquishing power

1281
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:45,440
in a way that that perhaps if russia

1282
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:48,159
succeeds

1283
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,800
forms a truly democratic state this

1284
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:50,480
would be

1285
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,480
how putin can become one of the great

1286
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:54,480
leaders in russian history

1287
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,920
at least in the in the context of the

1288
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,599
21st century

1289
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,960
i think there are two reasons why this

1290
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:02,079
is really hard

1291
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,800
for putin and for others one is

1292
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,318
the trappings of power are very

1293
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,119
seductive as you said before they're

1294
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:09,599
corrupting

1295
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,720
this is a real problem right if it's in

1296
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,960
the business context you don't want to

1297
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,959
give up that private jet

1298
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,280
if it's in putin's context it's billions

1299
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,358
of dollars every year that he's able to

1300
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,560
take for himself or give to his friends

1301
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:21,759
it's not that he'll be poor if he leaves

1302
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:23,519
he'll still be rich

1303
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,359
and he has billions of dollars stored

1304
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,400
away but he won't be able to get the new

1305
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:28,000
billions

1306
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,160
and so that's part of the trappings of

1307
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,159
power are a big deal

1308
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:33,440
and then second in putin's case in

1309
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:34,799
particular he has to be worried about

1310
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,119
what happens next

1311
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,400
will he be tried will someone you know

1312
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,318
try to come and arrest him will someone

1313
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,440
try to come and assassinate him

1314
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,800
um washington recognized that leaving

1315
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,960
early

1316
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,560
limited the corruption and limited the

1317
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,039
enemies that you made

1318
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,960
and so it was a strategic choice putin

1319
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,639
has at this point been in power too long

1320
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,559
and this comes back to your

1321
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:57,838
core insight it's a cliche but it's true

1322
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,199
power corrupts

1323
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:00,799
no one should have power for too long

1324
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:02,480
this was one of the best insights the

1325
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,318
founders of the united states had

1326
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:07,039
that power was to be held for a short

1327
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,960
time as a fiduciary responsibility

1328
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,239
not as something you owned right this is

1329
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,480
the problem with monarchy with

1330
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,959
aristocracy that you own power

1331
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,760
right we don't own power we we're in

1332
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,159
holding it in trust

1333
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,119
yeah there's uh there's some probably

1334
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,598
like

1335
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,358
very specific psychological study of uh

1336
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,640
how many years it takes for you to

1337
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,119
forget

1338
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:30,159
that you can't own power that's right

1339
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,079
there's you know

1340
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:33,920
that's could be a much more rigorous

1341
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,119
discussion about the length of terms

1342
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,760
that are appropriate

1343
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,079
but really there's an amount like stalin

1344
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,720
had power for 30 years like putin is

1345
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,000
pushing

1346
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:46,000
those that many years already

1347
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,838
there's a certain point where you forget

1348
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,880
the person you were before you took the

1349
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:50,639
power that's right

1350
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,160
you forget to be humble in the face of

1351
00:43:50,639 --> 00:43:55,118
this responsibility

1352
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:57,440
and then there's no going back that's

1353
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:00,480
right that's how dictators are born

1354
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,159
that's how the evil like authoritarians

1355
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,079
become

1356
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:10,159
evil or let's not use the word evil but

1357
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,599
uh counterproductive destructive to the

1358
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:13,358
to the ideal that they initially

1359
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:14,880
probably came to office with that's

1360
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,119
right that's right one of the

1361
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,680
core historical insights is people

1362
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,599
should move jobs

1363
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:23,598
and it supplies for ceos probably

1364
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:24,559
absolutely apps they can go become ceo

1365
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,800
somewhere else but

1366
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,159
don't stay ceo one place too long it's a

1367
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:29,680
problem with startups right the founder

1368
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:31,358
you can have a brilliant founder

1369
00:44:29,679 --> 00:44:33,279
and that founder doesn't want to let go

1370
00:44:31,358 --> 00:44:34,799
yeah right it's the same issue

1371
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,560
at the same time i mean this is where

1372
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,519
elon musk and

1373
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:41,039
a few others like uh larry page and

1374
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:42,960
sergey brin

1375
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,119
that stayed for quite a long time and

1376
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,119
they actually were the beacon

1377
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,240
they on their shoulders carried the

1378
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,200
dream the company

1379
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:53,039
yeah where everybody else doubted so but

1380
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:55,039
that seems to be the exception

1381
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,559
right versus the rule well and even

1382
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:58,239
sergey for example right

1383
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,159
has stepped back right he plays less of

1384
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:01,838
a day-to-day role and

1385
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,399
is not running google and the way he did

1386
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:07,199
the interesting thing is he stepped back

1387
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,119
in a quite tragic way from what i've

1388
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,358
seen which is

1389
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,318
i i think google's mission an initial

1390
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,000
mission

1391
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:15,440
of making the world's information

1392
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,119
accessible to everybody

1393
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,800
is one of the most beautiful missions of

1394
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:19,838
any company in the history of the world

1395
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,359
i think it's

1396
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:22,880
what google has done with a search

1397
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:25,358
engine and

1398
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,079
um and other efforts that are similar

1399
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:29,119
like scanning

1400
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,839
a lot of books it's just incredible it's

1401
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,519
similar to

1402
00:45:30,838 --> 00:45:36,159
wikipedia but

1403
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:37,039
what he said was that it's not the same

1404
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:39,838
company

1405
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,960
anymore and i i know maybe i'm reading

1406
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,119
too much into it

1407
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,480
because it's more maybe practically

1408
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,079
saying just the size of the company's

1409
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,960
much larger the kind of leadership

1410
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:49,039
that's required

1411
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,400
but at the same time sure they change

1412
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:53,440
the model from

1413
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,960
you know don't be evil to it's becoming

1414
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,838
corporatized and all those kinds of

1415
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,960
things and

1416
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:00,559
it's sad it um there also are cycles

1417
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,318
right history is about cycles right

1418
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,599
there there are cycles to life

1419
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:08,239
there's cycles to organizations it's sad

1420
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:08,960
i mean it's sad steve jobs leaving apple

1421
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:12,159
by

1422
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,559
passing away sad you know what the

1423
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:15,838
future of spacex and tesla looks like

1424
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:17,759
without elon musk

1425
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,358
is quite sad it's very possible that

1426
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,160
those companies become something very

1427
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,279
different

1428
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:24,318
they become something much more you know

1429
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,480
like corporate

1430
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:30,639
and uh stale

1431
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,400
yeah so maybe maybe most of progress is

1432
00:46:30,639 --> 00:46:33,279
made through cycles maybe a new elon

1433
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,318
musk comes along

1434
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,839
all those kinds of things but it does

1435
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:41,519
seem that the american

1436
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:44,880
system of government has has uh

1437
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:46,719
built into it the cycling yes

1438
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,519
that makes it effective and it makes it

1439
00:46:46,719 --> 00:46:52,159
last very long it lasts a very long time

1440
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:53,280
right it continues to excel and lead the

1441
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,239
world

1442
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,720
sure sure and let's hope it continues to

1443
00:46:56,239 --> 00:46:59,039
no it's

1444
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:59,919
i mean we we're into you know a third

1445
00:46:59,039 --> 00:47:02,639
century

1446
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,599
and democracies on this scale uh rarely

1447
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,318
last that long

1448
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,680
so that that's that's a point of pride

1449
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:09,199
but it also means we need to be

1450
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:09,598
attentive to keep our house in order

1451
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:12,078
because

1452
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,079
it's not inevitable that this experiment

1453
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,839
continues

1454
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:18,400
now it's important to meditate on that

1455
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:21,358
actually uh you've mentioned that fdr

1456
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,480
franklin d roosevelt is one of the great

1457
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,920
leaders

1458
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,719
in american history why is that franklin

1459
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,838
roosevelt

1460
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,759
had the power of empathy no

1461
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:34,078
leader that i have ever studied or been

1462
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,160
around or spent any time reading about

1463
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:37,680
was able to connect with people who were

1464
00:47:36,159 --> 00:47:39,759
so different from himself

1465
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,199
as franklin roosevelt he came from the

1466
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,880
most elite family he

1467
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:44,399
never had to work for a paycheck in his

1468
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,480
life when he was president he was still

1469
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,160
collecting an allowance from his mom

1470
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,599
i mean you couldn't be more elite than

1471
00:47:48,159 --> 00:47:52,558
franklin roosevelt

1472
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,960
but he authentically connected this was

1473
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,519
not

1474
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,760
you know propaganda he was able to feel

1475
00:47:55,519 --> 00:47:59,920
the pain and understand the lives of

1476
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,839
some of the most destitute

1477
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,480
americans in other parts of the country

1478
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:06,318
it's interesting so through the

1479
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,000
one of the hardest economic periods of

1480
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,119
american history he was able to feel the

1481
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:11,280
pain he was able to

1482
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,640
the number of immigrants i read oral

1483
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,319
histories from or who have written

1484
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:16,078
themselves saul bella was one example

1485
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,838
the great novelist who talked about how

1486
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:19,200
as immigrants to the u.s although i was

1487
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:20,558
a russian jewish immigrant

1488
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,759
he said growing up in chicago

1489
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,240
politicians were all trying to steal

1490
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,839
from us

1491
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:27,358
i didn't think any of them cared until i

1492
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:30,480
heard fdr and i knew he spoke to me

1493
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:32,558
uh and and i think part of it was fdr

1494
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,000
really tried to understand people that's

1495
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,800
the first he was humble enough to try to

1496
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,480
do that

1497
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,720
but second he had a talent for that and

1498
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:40,559
it's hard to know exactly what it was

1499
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:42,239
but he had a talent for putting himself

1500
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,440
imagining himself

1501
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:45,439
in someone else's shoes

1502
00:48:45,519 --> 00:48:49,759
what stands out to you as uh important i

1503
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:51,679
mean he said he was uh he went through

1504
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,160
the great depression

1505
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:56,558
the so the new deal which some people

1506
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,920
criticized some people see i mean it's

1507
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:01,519
it's funny to look at some of these

1508
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:01,519
policies and they're long

1509
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:07,118
ripple effects but at the time

1510
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:08,799
it's some of the most uh innovative

1511
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:10,000
policies yes in the in the history of

1512
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,160
america you could say

1513
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,079
they're ultimately not good for america

1514
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,480
but they're nevertheless

1515
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,519
hold within them very rich and important

1516
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,318
lessons

1517
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,000
but then you deal obviously world war ii

1518
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,920
of that entire process is there

1519
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:27,920
something that stands out to you as a

1520
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,960
particularly great moment

1521
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:34,720
that made fdr yes i think

1522
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:36,240
uh what fdr does from his first 100 days

1523
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:38,799
in office forward

1524
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,919
and this begins with his fireside chats

1525
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,920
is he helps

1526
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:43,280
americans to see that they're all in it

1527
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,159
together

1528
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,880
and that's by creating hope and creating

1529
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,440
a sense of

1530
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,358
common suffering and common mission it's

1531
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:52,480
not offering simple solutions one of the

1532
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,318
lessons from fdr

1533
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,079
is if you want to bring people together

1534
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:57,358
don't offer a simple solution

1535
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,880
because as soon as i offer a simple

1536
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,000
solution i have people for it and

1537
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,960
against it

1538
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,920
don't do that explain the problem frame

1539
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:06,000
the problem

1540
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,119
and then give people a mission so

1541
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,159
roosevelt's first

1542
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:12,240
uh radio address uh in march of 1933 the

1543
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,078
banking system is collapsing

1544
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:16,078
and we can't imagine it right banks were

1545
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,680
closing and you couldn't get your money

1546
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,280
out your life savings would be lost

1547
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,239
right we can't imagine that happening in

1548
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,079
our world today

1549
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,239
he comes on the radio he takes five

1550
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,440
minutes to explain how banking works

1551
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:26,959
most people didn't understand how

1552
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,318
banking worked right they don't actually

1553
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,240
hold your money in a vault

1554
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:32,639
they lend it out to someone else and

1555
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:33,919
then he explains why if you go

1556
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:35,519
and take your money out of the bank and

1557
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,720
put it in your mattress you're making it

1558
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,199
worse for yourself

1559
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:39,919
he explains this uh and then he says i

1560
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:41,199
don't he does

1561
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,119
i don't have a solution but here's what

1562
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:43,919
i'm gonna do i'm gonna send in

1563
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,800
government

1564
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:48,400
uh officers to examine the banks and

1565
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,480
show you the books on the banks

1566
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,240
and i want you to help me by going and

1567
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,240
putting your money back in the banks

1568
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:56,479
we're all gonna do this together no

1569
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:58,719
simple solution no ideological statement

1570
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,159
but a sense of common mission let's go

1571
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:02,639
out and do this together

1572
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:04,239
when you read as i have so many of these

1573
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:05,838
oral histories and memoirs for people

1574
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:07,199
who lived through that period

1575
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:09,199
many of them disagreed with some of his

1576
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:10,719
policies many of them thought he was too

1577
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:12,399
close to jews and they didn't like the

1578
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:13,279
fact he had a woman in his cabinet and

1579
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,000
all that

1580
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:18,160
but they felt he cared and they felt

1581
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,519
they were part of some common mission

1582
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:21,118
and when they talk about their

1583
00:51:19,519 --> 00:51:22,880
experience fighting in world war ii

1584
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:24,559
whether in europe or asia

1585
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,920
it was that that prepared them they knew

1586
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:29,040
what it meant to be an american

1587
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,400
when they were over there so that to me

1588
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,719
is a model of leadership

1589
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:34,079
and i think that's as possible today as

1590
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:34,799
it's ever been so you think it's

1591
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:38,160
possible like

1592
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:40,960
i was going to ask this again it may be

1593
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:44,000
a very shallow

1594
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:46,960
view but it feels like this country is

1595
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,480
is more divided than it has been in uh

1596
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,880
recent history

1597
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,159
perhaps the social media and all those

1598
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,559
kinds of things are

1599
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,239
merely revealing the division as opposed

1600
00:51:54,559 --> 00:52:00,000
to creating the division

1601
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:02,959
but is it possible to have a leader

1602
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,318
that unites in the same way that fdr did

1603
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,480
without well

1604
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,000
we're living through a pandemic this is

1605
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,679
already yes

1606
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,599
so like i was gonna say without

1607
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:12,239
suffering but there's this is economic

1608
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:13,519
suffering

1609
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:16,318
right huge number of people have lost

1610
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:18,800
their job so is it possible to have

1611
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:20,318
uh is there one a hunger is is there a

1612
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,920
possibility to have an fdr

1613
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:25,679
style leader who unites yes i think that

1614
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,200
is what president biden is trying i'm

1615
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,318
not saying he i'm not saying he'll he'll

1616
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:29,199
succeed but i think that's what he's

1617
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:31,199
trying to do

1618
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,118
the way you do this is you do not allow

1619
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:34,318
yourself to be captured by your

1620
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,640
opponents

1621
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,079
in congress or somewhere else fdr had a

1622
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:39,838
lot of opponents in congress he had a

1623
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:41,680
lot of opponents in politics

1624
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:43,838
governors and others who didn't like him

1625
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:46,000
uh herbert hoover was still around

1626
00:52:43,838 --> 00:52:47,838
and still accusing fdr of being you know

1627
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,960
a conspiratorist and all these other

1628
00:52:47,838 --> 00:52:51,519
things so

1629
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,960
um you don't allow yourself to be

1630
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,719
captured by the leaders of the other

1631
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,679
side you go over their heads to the

1632
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:58,239
people

1633
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:00,159
and so today the way to do this is to

1634
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,679
explain to people and empathize with the

1635
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:03,440
suffering and dislocation and

1636
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,759
difficulties they're dealing with

1637
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:07,200
and show that you're trying to help them

1638
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,200
not an easy solution

1639
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:10,480
not a simple statement but here are some

1640
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,000
things we can all do

1641
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,599
together that's why i think

1642
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,599
infrastructure makes a lot of sense it's

1643
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:18,160
what fdr invested into

1644
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,359
right fdr built hoover dam hoover dam

1645
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:20,879
turned the lights on

1646
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:22,639
for young lyndon johnson who grew up

1647
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:25,119
outside of austin right

1648
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:27,279
fdr was the one who invested in road

1649
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,200
construction that was then continued by

1650
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,880
dwight eisenhower by a republican with

1651
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:33,598
the interstate highway system

1652
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,039
right fdr invested through the wpa in

1653
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:37,039
building thousands of schools in our

1654
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:39,279
country planting trees

1655
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:40,318
that's the kind of work that can bring

1656
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,599
people together

1657
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:43,679
you don't have to be a democrat or

1658
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,519
republican to say you know what we'd be

1659
00:53:43,679 --> 00:53:47,358
a lot better off in my community if we

1660
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:48,639
had better infrastructure today

1661
00:53:47,358 --> 00:53:50,078
i want to be a part of that or well

1662
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:51,118
maybe i can get a job doing that maybe

1663
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:53,519
my company

1664
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,960
can benefit from that you bring people

1665
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:56,400
together and that way it becomes a

1666
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,159
common mission

1667
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,480
even if we have different ideological

1668
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:03,598
positions yeah it's funny i

1669
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,559
i've uh when i first heard joe biden i

1670
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:06,240
think many

1671
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:08,839
i mean many years ago i think he went

1672
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:10,879
for president against

1673
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:13,039
obama and i

1674
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,440
before i heard him speak i really liked

1675
00:54:13,039 --> 00:54:15,759
him but once i heard him speak i stopped

1676
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,000
i

1677
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,359
started like him less and less and it

1678
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:22,079
speaks to something

1679
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,639
interesting where it's hard to put into

1680
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,960
words

1681
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:27,279
what why you connect with people the

1682
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,079
empathy that you mentioned in fdr

1683
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:31,599
you have like these bad pardon the

1684
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:32,720
french [ __ ] like teddy

1685
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,640
roosevelt

1686
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:35,919
that connect with you there's something

1687
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:38,239
just powerful

1688
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,440
and with joe biden i can't i i want to

1689
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:42,000
really like him and like

1690
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,440
there's something not quite there where

1691
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,639
it feels like he doesn't

1692
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:49,920
quite know my pain even though he

1693
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:51,199
on paper is exactly you know he knows

1694
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,798
the pain of the people and there's

1695
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:54,239
something not connecting and it's

1696
00:54:52,798 --> 00:54:56,480
it's hard to explain it's hard to put

1697
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:59,919
into words and uh

1698
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,000
it makes me not uh

1699
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:03,280
as a engineer and scientist it makes me

1700
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:06,318
not feel good about

1701
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,440
like presidencies because it makes me

1702
00:55:06,318 --> 00:55:09,838
feel like it's more

1703
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,358
art than science it is an art and and i

1704
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:13,119
think it's exactly an art for the

1705
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:14,719
reasons you laid out it's aesthetic

1706
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,079
it's about feeling it's about emotion

1707
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:17,199
all the things that we can't engineer

1708
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,039
we've tried for

1709
00:55:17,199 --> 00:55:20,480
centuries to engineer emotion we're

1710
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:21,519
never gonna do it don't try it i'm a

1711
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,639
parent of teenagers

1712
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,318
don't even try to explain emotion um

1713
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:27,679
but you hit on the key point of the key

1714
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:28,400
challenge for biden he's got to find the

1715
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:30,960
right words

1716
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:32,000
yeah it's not finding the words to

1717
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,838
[ __ ] people

1718
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,280
yeah it's finding the words to help

1719
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:37,679
express we've all felt

1720
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,599
empowered and felt good when someone

1721
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:40,399
uses words that put into words what

1722
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:42,240
we're feeling

1723
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,480
yeah that's what he needs that's the job

1724
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:46,479
of a leader and there's certain words

1725
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,760
i haven't heard many politicians use

1726
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:48,000
those words but there's certain words

1727
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,280
that

1728
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:53,519
like make you forget

1729
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,519
that uh that you're for immigration or

1730
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:57,119
uh against immigration make you forget

1731
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:57,679
whether you're four wars and against

1732
00:55:57,119 --> 00:56:00,480
wars

1733
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:01,039
but you forget about like the bickering

1734
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:03,920
and

1735
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:04,239
somehow like uh inspire you like elevate

1736
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,000
you

1737
00:56:04,239 --> 00:56:07,598
to believe in the greatness that this

1738
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,760
country could be yes

1739
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,119
um in that same way like the reason i

1740
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,240
moved to austin

1741
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:17,440
is funny to say is like i just heard

1742
00:56:14,239 --> 00:56:20,558
words from people from friends

1743
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,760
where they're excited by the possibility

1744
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,839
of the future here

1745
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,520
i wasn't thinking like what's the right

1746
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,880
thing to do what's like

1747
00:56:25,519 --> 00:56:28,960
strategic because i want to launch a

1748
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,200
business there's a lot of arguments with

1749
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,240
san francisco or maybe staying in boston

1750
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:35,519
in my case

1751
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:37,279
but there's this excitement that

1752
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,719
that was beyond reason that was

1753
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,480
emotional yes yes

1754
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:42,558
and that that's that's what it seems

1755
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,079
like that's what builds

1756
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,680
that's what great leaders do but that's

1757
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,400
what builds countries that's what build

1758
00:56:45,679 --> 00:56:48,639
grades

1759
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,639
great businesses that's right and it's

1760
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,400
what people say about austin for example

1761
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:53,920
all the time yeah a talented people who

1762
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,519
come here like yourself

1763
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,079
and here's the interesting thing no one

1764
00:56:55,519 --> 00:57:00,239
person creates that the words emerge

1765
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,839
and part of what fdr understood is

1766
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:02,798
you've got to find the words out there

1767
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:04,880
and use them

1768
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:06,880
yeah you don't have to be the creator of

1769
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,240
them right just as the great painter

1770
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:10,160
doesn't invent the painting they're

1771
00:57:08,239 --> 00:57:12,479
taking things from others

1772
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,440
as a small aside is there something you

1773
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,159
could say about

1774
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:18,159
fdr and hitler

1775
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:23,838
i constantly tried to think can can this

1776
00:57:22,318 --> 00:57:24,880
person can this moment in history have

1777
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:29,199
been

1778
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:32,160
um circumvented prevented

1779
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:34,719
can hitler have been stopped can some of

1780
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,960
the atrocities from my own family

1781
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,759
that like my grandparents had to live

1782
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:39,838
through the

1783
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:41,920
the starvation in the soviet union so

1784
00:57:39,838 --> 00:57:42,318
the thing that people don't often talk

1785
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:44,240
about

1786
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:46,798
is the atrocities committed by stalin

1787
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:51,439
and his own people

1788
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:55,519
it feels like here's this great leader

1789
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:59,280
fdr that had the chance to

1790
00:57:55,519 --> 00:58:03,838
um to have an impact on the world

1791
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:04,400
that um he already probably had a great

1792
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:08,400
positive

1793
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:09,838
impact but had a had a chance to stop

1794
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,160
maybe world war ii

1795
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:13,039
or st stop some of the evils when you

1796
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,000
look at what

1797
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:17,759
how weak hitler was from much of the 30s

1798
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
relative to militarily

1799
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:23,440
relative to everything else how many

1800
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:26,559
people could have done a lot to stop him

1801
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,519
and fdr in particular didn't

1802
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:29,519
he tried to play

1803
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:34,159
not pacify but basically do diplomacy

1804
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:37,440
and

1805
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:38,318
let let germany do germany let europe do

1806
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:41,119
europe

1807
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:42,719
and focus on america is there is there

1808
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:44,559
something you would uh would you hold

1809
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:46,480
his feet to the fire on this

1810
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:48,640
or is it very difficult from the

1811
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,838
perspective of fdr to have known

1812
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:52,960
what was coming i think fdr had a sense

1813
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:54,639
of what was coming not

1814
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,240
quite the enormity of what hitler was

1815
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:57,920
doing and not quite the enormity of what

1816
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:01,519
the holocaust became i also lost

1817
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,519
relatives in the holocaust um

1818
00:59:01,679 --> 00:59:04,719
and part of that was beyond the

1819
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:05,838
imagination of human beings yes but it's

1820
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:09,039
clear in his papers

1821
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:10,798
um that as early as 1934 people he

1822
00:59:09,039 --> 00:59:11,519
respected who he knew well told him that

1823
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:13,119
hitler was

1824
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:15,119
very dangerous they also thought it was

1825
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:16,960
crazy that he was a lunatic

1826
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:18,400
hamilton fish armstrong who is a friend

1827
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:19,679
of of roosevelt

1828
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,880
uh who was actually the council on

1829
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,798
foreign relations in new york had a

1830
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,480
meeting with hitler in 1934 i remember

1831
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:26,079
reading the account of this

1832
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:27,679
uh and he basically said definitely this

1833
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,960
man is going to cause a war he's going

1834
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:30,480
to cause a lot of damage again they

1835
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:32,798
didn't know quite the scale

1836
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,960
so they saw this coming they saw this

1837
00:59:32,798 --> 00:59:37,280
coming fdr had two problems

1838
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,559
first he had an american public that was

1839
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:40,160
deeply isolationist

1840
00:59:38,559 --> 00:59:41,359
the opposite of the problem in a sense

1841
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,598
that we were talking about before if

1842
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,598
we're an over militarized society

1843
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,240
now we were a deeply isolationist

1844
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,440
society in the 1930s the the depression

1845
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:51,439
reinforced that

1846
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:53,760
fdr actually had to break the law in the

1847
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:56,559
late 30s to support the allies

1848
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,079
so it was very hard to move the country

1849
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:59,760
in that direction especially when he had

1850
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:00,880
this program at home

1851
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,440
the new deal that he didn't want to

1852
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,720
jeopardize by alienating an isolationist

1853
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,240
public that was the reality we talked

1854
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:06,558
about political manipulation he had to

1855
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:08,159
be

1856
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,559
conscious of that he had to know his

1857
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:13,519
audience and second

1858
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:14,400
there were no allies willing to invest

1859
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,039
in this either

1860
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,559
the british were as uh as committed to

1861
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:20,000
appeasement as you know you're obviously

1862
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,040
very knowledgeable about this the the

1863
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:22,880
french were as well

1864
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:24,558
it was very hard the russian government

1865
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:26,000
the soviet government was cooperating to

1866
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:28,240
re-militarize

1867
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:29,599
germany so there weren't a lot of allies

1868
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:31,598
out there either

1869
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,359
um i think if there's a criticism to be

1870
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:37,280
made of fdr

1871
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:39,119
it's that once we're in the war

1872
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:41,119
he didn't do enough to stop in

1873
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:42,720
particular the killing of jews

1874
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,079
and there are a number of historians

1875
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:45,679
myself included who have written about

1876
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,720
this and it's an endless debate what

1877
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:49,358
should he have done

1878
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,239
there's no doubt by 1944 the united

1879
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:51,759
states had

1880
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:53,279
air superiority and could have bombed

1881
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,960
the rail lines to auschwitz

1882
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,480
and other camps that would have saved as

1883
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,039
many as a million jews that's a lot of

1884
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,760
people

1885
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:01,119
who could have been saved why didn't fdr

1886
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,960
insist on that

1887
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,280
um in part because he wanted to use

1888
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,559
every resource possible to win the war

1889
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,559
he did not want to be accused of

1890
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:10,240
fighting the war for jews but i think

1891
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,000
it's also fair to say that he probably

1892
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,318
cared less about jews

1893
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,119
and east europeans than he did about

1894
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:17,199
others um

1895
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:18,960
those of his own dutch ancestry and and

1896
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:20,480
from western europe and so

1897
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:22,079
you know even there race comes in is

1898
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,440
also the explanation for the internment

1899
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,000
of japanese in the united states which

1900
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:25,760
is a horrible

1901
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,798
war crime committed by this heroic

1902
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,520
president 120 000 japanese-american

1903
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:32,239
citizens

1904
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:33,280
lost their freedom unnecessarily so he

1905
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:35,358
had his limitations

1906
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,280
and and i think he could have done more

1907
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:39,199
during the war

1908
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,480
to save many more lives and i wish he

1909
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:43,279
had and there's something

1910
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,559
to be said about empathy that you spoke

1911
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,839
that fdr had

1912
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:49,680
empathy but us for example now there's

1913
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:51,920
many people who describe the atrocities

1914
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:53,519
happening in china

1915
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,039
and there's a bunch of places across the

1916
01:01:53,519 --> 01:01:56,318
world where there's atrocities happening

1917
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,880
now and

1918
01:01:56,318 --> 01:01:58,880
we care

1919
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:04,558
we do not uniformly apply how much we

1920
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,480
care for the suffering of others

1921
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:08,880
that's correct depending on the group

1922
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,000
that's correct and in some sense

1923
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:15,119
the role of the president is to uh

1924
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:16,798
to uh rise above that natural human

1925
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:18,720
inclination to protect

1926
01:02:16,798 --> 01:02:20,559
to do the us versus them to protect

1927
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,318
protect the inner circle

1928
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:24,480
and empathize with the suffering of

1929
01:02:22,318 --> 01:02:28,880
those that are not like you

1930
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,880
that's correct i agree with that yeah

1931
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:34,960
speaking of war you wrote a book on

1932
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:36,960
henry kissinger

1933
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,119
it's not a great transition but it made

1934
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:41,920
sense in my head

1935
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:43,358
who was henry kissinger as a man and as

1936
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,039
a historical figure

1937
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:47,279
so henry kissinger to me is one of the

1938
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:49,359
most fascinating figures in history

1939
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:51,519
because he comes to the united states as

1940
01:02:49,358 --> 01:02:53,679
a german jewish immigrant at age 15

1941
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:54,719
speaking no english and within a few

1942
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:57,279
years

1943
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,879
he's a major figure influencing u.s

1944
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,000
foreign policy at the height of u.s

1945
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:03,760
power but while he's doing that he he's

1946
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:06,719
never elected to office

1947
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:08,400
and he's constantly reviled by people

1948
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:09,118
including people who are anti-semitic

1949
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,240
because he's

1950
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:14,640
jewish but at the same time also his

1951
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:15,598
exoticism makes him more attractive to

1952
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:17,920
people

1953
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,440
so someone like nelson rockefeller wants

1954
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,720
kissinger around he's one of kissinger's

1955
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:21,838
first patrons because he wants a really

1956
01:03:20,719 --> 01:03:23,279
smart jew

1957
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:25,038
and kissinger is going to be that smart

1958
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:26,720
jewel i called kissinger a policy jew

1959
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:28,400
there were these court jews in the 16th

1960
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,318
and 17th and 18th centuries in europe

1961
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,119
every king wanted the jew to manage his

1962
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:33,119
banking

1963
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,280
and in a sense in the united states in

1964
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,318
the second half of the 20th century many

1965
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,760
presidents want a

1966
01:03:36,318 --> 01:03:39,358
jew to manage their international

1967
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,280
affairs and what does that really mean

1968
01:03:39,358 --> 01:03:42,838
it's not just about being jewish

1969
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,400
it's the internationalism it's the

1970
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:45,679
cosmopolitanism

1971
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,200
that's one of the things i was

1972
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:48,960
fascinated with with kissinger someone

1973
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:50,639
like kissinger is unthinkable as a

1974
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:52,559
powerful figure in the united states

1975
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:54,400
30 or 40 years earlier because the

1976
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:55,440
united states is run by wasps it's run

1977
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,440
by

1978
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,720
white elites who come from a certain

1979
01:03:57,440 --> 01:04:00,400
background

1980
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,000
kissinger represents a moment when

1981
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:03,119
american society opens up not to

1982
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,039
everyone

1983
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:07,119
but opens up to these cosmopolitan

1984
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,599
figures who have language skills

1985
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,599
historical knowledge networks that can

1986
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,200
be used for the us government

1987
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,359
when after world war ii we have to

1988
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:16,798
rebuild europe when we have to negotiate

1989
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,279
with the soviet union when we need the

1990
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:21,519
kinds of knowledge we didn't have before

1991
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:23,280
and harvard where he gets his education

1992
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:24,798
late he started at city college actually

1993
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:25,519
but harvard where he gets his education

1994
01:04:24,798 --> 01:04:26,960
late

1995
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:28,559
is at the center of what's happening at

1996
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:30,000
all these major universities at harvard

1997
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,798
and yale at stanford at the university

1998
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,599
of texas

1999
01:04:30,798 --> 01:04:35,440
everywhere where they're growing in

2000
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:37,039
their international affairs bringing in

2001
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,559
the kinds of people who never would be

2002
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:41,039
at the university before

2003
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:41,920
training them and then enlisting them in

2004
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,000
cold war

2005
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:46,079
activities and so kissinger is a

2006
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,519
representative of that phenomenon i

2007
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,039
became interested in him

2008
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:51,119
because i think he's a bellwether he

2009
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:53,520
shows how power has

2010
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:55,200
changed in the united states so he

2011
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:58,719
enters this whole world of

2012
01:04:55,199 --> 01:05:02,318
uh politics what post-world war ii

2013
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:04,558
in the 50s yes so he he actually

2014
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:06,239
in the 40s even it's an extraordinary

2015
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,359
story he comes to the united states in

2016
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:09,118
1938

2017
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:10,558
just before crystal knocked his family

2018
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,838
leaves they he actually grew up right

2019
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:14,640
outside of nuremberg

2020
01:05:11,838 --> 01:05:16,078
they leave right before kristallnacht in

2021
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:17,920
in fall of 38.

2022
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:20,079
come to come to new york he originally

2023
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,880
works in a brush factory cleaning

2024
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:24,160
brushes

2025
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,920
goes to a public high school and in 1942

2026
01:05:24,159 --> 01:05:27,199
just after pearl harbor he joins the

2027
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,318
military

2028
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:32,159
and he's very quickly in the military

2029
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:33,679
first of all given citizenship which he

2030
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,759
didn't have before

2031
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,358
uh he sent from the first time outside

2032
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:38,799
of a kosher home he had been in a kosher

2033
01:05:37,358 --> 01:05:42,159
home his entire life he sent to

2034
01:05:38,798 --> 01:05:45,119
south carolina to eat ham for uncle sam

2035
01:05:42,159 --> 01:05:46,798
and then he is and this is extraordinary

2036
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,680
at the age of 20

2037
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:50,079
uh barely speaking english he is sent

2038
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:53,239
back

2039
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:54,720
to germany with the u.s army in an elite

2040
01:05:53,239 --> 01:05:57,679
counter-intelligence role

2041
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:59,199
why because they need german speakers he

2042
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:00,639
came when he was 15 so he actually

2043
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:02,399
understands the society many people have

2044
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:05,118
that cultural knowledge

2045
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,599
and because he's jewish they can trust

2046
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:09,280
that he'll be anti-nazi

2047
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:11,200
and there's a whole group of these

2048
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:13,920
figures he's one of many

2049
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:15,759
and so he's in an elite circle he's

2050
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,280
discriminated against in new york

2051
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,200
when he goes to harvard after that he

2052
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,798
can only live in a jewish-only dorm

2053
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:22,960
but at the same time he's in an elite

2054
01:06:20,798 --> 01:06:24,400
policy role in counter-intelligence he

2055
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:26,639
forms a network there

2056
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,599
that stays with him the rest of his uh

2057
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:29,118
career

2058
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:31,280
there's a gentleman named fritz cramer

2059
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:33,280
who becomes a sponsor of his

2060
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:34,720
in the emerging pentagon defense

2061
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,200
department world

2062
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:38,239
and as early as the early 1950s he sent

2063
01:06:37,199 --> 01:06:40,318
them to korea

2064
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:42,798
to comment on affairs in korea he

2065
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:44,079
becomes both an intellectual recognized

2066
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,838
for his connections

2067
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:47,280
but also someone who policymakers want

2068
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:48,639
to talk about his book on nuclear

2069
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,519
weapons when it's written

2070
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:53,279
is given to president eisenhower to read

2071
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:55,119
because they say this is someone writing

2072
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:57,599
interesting things you should read

2073
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:58,559
what he says there's a certain aspect to

2074
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,318
him that's

2075
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:02,079
kind of like forrest gump he seems to

2076
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:03,679
continuously be the right person at the

2077
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,519
right time in the right place

2078
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:07,519
that's right somehow finding him in this

2079
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:11,358
i don't i don't unders you know

2080
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:13,358
you can only get lucky so many times

2081
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:15,598
because he continues to get lucky

2082
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,038
in terms of being at the right place in

2083
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,680
in history

2084
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:21,760
for many decades until today yeah well

2085
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,399
he has a knack for that he i spend a lot

2086
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,760
of time

2087
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,960
talking with him um and what comes

2088
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:30,079
through very

2089
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:32,240
quickly is that he has an eye for power

2090
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,480
uh it's i think unhealthy he's obsessed

2091
01:07:32,239 --> 01:07:37,199
with power can you explain

2092
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:38,159
like an observer of power or this or

2093
01:07:37,199 --> 01:07:39,919
being uh

2094
01:07:38,159 --> 01:07:41,920
does he want power himself yes both of

2095
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,599
those things both of them

2096
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,119
and i think i explained this in the book

2097
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:45,760
uh he doesn't agree with what i'm going

2098
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,358
to say now

2099
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,720
um but i think i'm right and i think

2100
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:49,679
he's right it's very hard to analyze

2101
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:53,118
yourself right yeah

2102
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:55,519
um i think he develops an obsession with

2103
01:07:53,119 --> 01:07:57,599
gaining power because he sees what

2104
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:00,719
happens when you have no power

2105
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:03,359
he experiences the trauma his

2106
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:03,919
uh father is a very respected gymnasium

2107
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:06,639
lair

2108
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:09,440
in germany even though he's jewish he's

2109
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:12,400
actually the teacher of german classics

2110
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,358
to the german kids this is great and

2111
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:15,680
he's forced

2112
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:17,119
to flee and he becomes nothing his

2113
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:18,639
father never really

2114
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:20,640
makes a way for himself in the united

2115
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:22,000
states he becomes a postal delivery

2116
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,000
person which is nothing wrong with that

2117
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:26,079
but for someone who's a respected

2118
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,759
teacher in germany and game losing there

2119
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:29,838
are like professors there right

2120
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,359
to then be in this position his mother

2121
01:08:29,838 --> 01:08:32,640
has to open and catering business when

2122
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:34,719
they come to new york

2123
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:35,679
it's a it's a typical immigrant story

2124
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:37,838
but he sees the trauma

2125
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:39,759
his grandparents are killed by the nazis

2126
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:42,158
um so he sees the trauma

2127
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:43,039
and he realizes how perilous it is to be

2128
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,278
without power

2129
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:46,479
and you're saying he does not want to

2130
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:49,600
acknowledge

2131
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:51,439
the the effect of that it's hard

2132
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,798
it's hard i mean most of us if we've had

2133
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:54,158
drama

2134
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:55,838
it's believable that it's traumatic

2135
01:08:54,158 --> 01:08:56,960
because you don't talk about it i have a

2136
01:08:55,838 --> 01:08:59,359
friend who interviews

2137
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:01,198
uh combat veterans and he says as soon

2138
01:08:59,359 --> 01:09:02,640
as someone freely wants to tell me about

2139
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:04,238
their combat trauma

2140
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,640
i suspect that they're not telling me

2141
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:08,879
the truth if it's traumatic it's hard to

2142
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,279
talk about

2143
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:13,199
yeah sometimes i wonder how much from my

2144
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,040
own life

2145
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:16,719
everything that i've ever done is just

2146
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:18,640
the result of my the complicated

2147
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:21,920
relationship with my father

2148
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:23,440
i i tend to

2149
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:25,600
i had a really difficult time did a

2150
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:28,719
podcast conversation with him

2151
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,560
i saw it actually perfect it's great

2152
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,838
it was i i regret it i never do that

2153
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,400
with my voice

2154
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:37,039
but i i remember as i was doing it and

2155
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:39,599
for months after i regretted doing it

2156
01:09:37,039 --> 01:09:40,798
i just kept regretting it and the fact

2157
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,880
that i was regretting it

2158
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:44,238
spoke to the to the fact that i'm

2159
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:47,759
running away from some

2160
01:09:44,238 --> 01:09:50,000
truths that are back there somewhere

2161
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,039
and that's perhaps what kissinger is as

2162
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,759
well but

2163
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:56,079
is there i mean he's done he's been a

2164
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:58,158
part of so many interesting

2165
01:09:56,079 --> 01:09:59,119
moments of american history of world

2166
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:02,079
history

2167
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:03,519
from the cold war vietnam war until

2168
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:06,000
today

2169
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,920
what stands out to you as a particularly

2170
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:11,279
important moment

2171
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:14,640
um in his career that that made

2172
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:17,759
who he is well i think

2173
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:21,679
uh what made his career in in many ways

2174
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:23,920
uh was uh his experience in the 1950s

2175
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:26,640
building a network

2176
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,158
a network of people across the world who

2177
01:10:26,640 --> 01:10:30,960
were rising

2178
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:33,519
leaders from unique positions he ran

2179
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:36,239
what he called the international seminar

2180
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,679
at harvard um which was actually a

2181
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:39,198
summer school class that no one at

2182
01:10:37,679 --> 01:10:42,880
harvard cared about

2183
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:45,198
but he invited all of these

2184
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:46,719
rising intellectuals and thinkers from

2185
01:10:45,198 --> 01:10:49,439
around the world

2186
01:10:46,719 --> 01:10:51,279
and he built a network there that he

2187
01:10:49,439 --> 01:10:52,158
used uh forevermore so that's what

2188
01:10:51,279 --> 01:10:55,039
really i think

2189
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:56,799
boosts him um the most important moments

2190
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,560
in terms of making his reputation

2191
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:02,159
making his career or two sets of

2192
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:04,800
activities one is the opening to china

2193
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:06,479
and his ability to first of all take

2194
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,400
control of u.s policy without the

2195
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:09,599
authority to do that and direct u.s

2196
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:11,439
policy

2197
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,280
and then build a relationship with mao

2198
01:11:11,439 --> 01:11:15,279
tsudung and joe and lai

2199
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:16,559
that was unthinkable just four or five

2200
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:18,238
years earlier uh

2201
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,520
of course president nixon is a big part

2202
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:21,279
of that as well but kissinger is the

2203
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:23,600
mover and shaker on that and it's a lot

2204
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:26,000
of manipulation but it's also a vision

2205
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,840
now this is put in the moment of

2206
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,600
american history where there's a very

2207
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,640
powerful anti-communism

2208
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:35,039
correct so communism is seen as

2209
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:36,320
much more even though than today as the

2210
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:37,920
enemy correct

2211
01:11:36,319 --> 01:11:40,559
and china in particular they were one of

2212
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:42,319
our key enemies in uh vietnam

2213
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,239
and in korea american forces were

2214
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:46,639
fighting chinese forces directly chinese

2215
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:48,079
forces come over the border

2216
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:49,760
thousands of americans die at the hand

2217
01:11:48,079 --> 01:11:50,800
of chinese forces right so for the long

2218
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,400
time the united states had no

2219
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,320
relationship with communist china he

2220
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:57,359
opens that relationship

2221
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:59,359
and at the same time he also creates a

2222
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:01,599
whole new dynamic in the middle east

2223
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:03,920
after the 1973 war the so-called yom

2224
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,400
kippur war he steps in and becomes the

2225
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,359
leading negotiator between the israelis

2226
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:10,079
the egyptians

2227
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:11,920
and other major actors in the region and

2228
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:13,198
it makes the united states the most

2229
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,279
powerful actor in the middle east the

2230
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:16,719
soviet union far less powerful

2231
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:18,719
which is great for the united states in

2232
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:20,399
the 70s and 80s it gets us though into

2233
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:22,960
the problems we of course have

2234
01:12:20,399 --> 01:12:24,799
thereafter so that that speaks to the

2235
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,520
very pragmatic

2236
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,640
approach that he's taken um the

2237
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:32,080
realistic approach

2238
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:35,199
versus the idealistic approach uh

2239
01:12:32,079 --> 01:12:35,600
the termed uh real politic what is this

2240
01:12:35,198 --> 01:12:37,439
thing

2241
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:38,800
what is it what is this approach to

2242
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:42,399
world politics

2243
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:45,520
so realpolitik for kissinger is um

2244
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:46,879
really focusing on the power centers in

2245
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,120
the world

2246
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:50,719
and trying as best you can to manipulate

2247
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:52,399
those power centers to serve the

2248
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:54,239
interests of your own country

2249
01:12:52,399 --> 01:12:55,839
and so that's why he's a multilateralist

2250
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:58,000
he's not a unilateralist

2251
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,000
he believes the united states should put

2252
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,840
itself at the center of negotiations

2253
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,359
between other powerful countries

2254
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,880
but that's also why he pays very little

2255
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:06,399
attention to countries that are less

2256
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,880
powerful and this is why he's often

2257
01:13:06,399 --> 01:13:11,599
criticized by human rights activists

2258
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,319
for him parts of africa and latin

2259
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,920
america

2260
01:13:12,319 --> 01:13:15,519
which you and i would consider important

2261
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:16,880
places are unimportant

2262
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:18,719
because they don't have power they can't

2263
01:13:16,880 --> 01:13:20,400
project their power they don't produce a

2264
01:13:18,719 --> 01:13:22,640
lot of economic wealth

2265
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:26,960
and so they matter less realpolitik

2266
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:30,079
views the world in a hierarchy of power

2267
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:32,560
how does real politic

2268
01:13:30,079 --> 01:13:33,600
realize itself in the world what what is

2269
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,239
it what does that

2270
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,840
really mean like how do you uh push

2271
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:39,919
forward the interest of your own country

2272
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:43,840
you said there's power centers

2273
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:46,719
but it uh is a big bold move

2274
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,360
to negotiate to work with a communist

2275
01:13:46,719 --> 01:13:50,640
nation

2276
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:52,719
with your enemies that are powerful

2277
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:53,920
how what is the sort of if you can

2278
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:55,920
further elaborate sure

2279
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,840
philosophy behind it sure so there there

2280
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:59,600
are two key elements that then

2281
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,119
end up producing all kinds of tactics

2282
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,320
but the two strategic elements of

2283
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:04,479
kissinger's way of thinking about

2284
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:06,960
realpolitik which are classical ways

2285
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:08,559
going back to thucydides and the greeks

2286
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,800
are to say first of all

2287
01:14:08,560 --> 01:14:13,280
you figure out who your allies are and

2288
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:16,159
you build webs of connection

2289
01:14:13,279 --> 01:14:18,000
so that your allies help you to acquire

2290
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:20,000
what you want to acquire

2291
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,198
right this is why according to herodotus

2292
01:14:20,000 --> 01:14:22,960
the greeks beat the persians the

2293
01:14:21,198 --> 01:14:24,479
persians are bigger but the greeks the

2294
01:14:22,960 --> 01:14:25,840
spartans the athenians others are able

2295
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:27,119
to work together and leverage their

2296
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,640
resources right

2297
01:14:27,119 --> 01:14:30,960
so it's about leveraging your resources

2298
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,320
for kissinger this makes western europe

2299
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,039
crucially important

2300
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,319
it makes japan crucially important it

2301
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:38,319
makes israel

2302
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:39,679
and egypt crucially important right in

2303
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:41,599
building these webs you

2304
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:42,960
build your surrogates you build your

2305
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,480
brother states

2306
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,158
in other parts of the world you build

2307
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:47,279
tight connections and you work together

2308
01:14:46,158 --> 01:14:49,439
to control

2309
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:50,800
the resources that you want the second

2310
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:53,519
element of the strategy

2311
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:55,920
is not to go to war with your adversary

2312
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:57,280
but to do all you can to limit the power

2313
01:14:55,920 --> 01:14:59,199
of your adversary

2314
01:14:57,279 --> 01:15:00,880
some of that is containment uh

2315
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:02,399
preventing the soviet union from

2316
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,079
expanding that was the key element of

2317
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:07,039
american cold war policy

2318
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:08,479
but sometimes it's actually negotiation

2319
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:10,079
that's what de tant was about for

2320
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:11,039
kissinger he spends a lot of time more

2321
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:12,960
time than any other

2322
01:15:11,039 --> 01:15:14,319
american foreign policymaker negotiating

2323
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:16,000
with soviet leaders

2324
01:15:14,319 --> 01:15:17,519
as well as chinese leaders what does he

2325
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,319
want to do he wants to limit the nuclear

2326
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:21,360
arms race

2327
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:22,840
the united states is ahead we don't want

2328
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:24,479
the soviet union to get ahead of us we

2329
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:26,239
negotiate um

2330
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:28,000
to limit their abilities right we play

2331
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:30,479
to our strengths

2332
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:33,520
so it's a combination of keeping your

2333
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:35,759
adversary down and building tight webs

2334
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:37,760
within that context military force is

2335
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,960
used but you're not using war for the

2336
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,440
sake of war

2337
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,198
you're using warfare to further your

2338
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:45,839
access to the resources

2339
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:46,399
economic political geographic that you

2340
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,319
want

2341
01:15:46,399 --> 01:15:50,079
to build relationships and then the

2342
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:50,960
second thing to limit the powers of

2343
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:55,359
those you're against

2344
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:57,840
exactly so is there any uh sort of um

2345
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:58,960
insights into how he preferred to build

2346
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,760
relationships

2347
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,960
are we talking about like again it's the

2348
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,560
one-on-one

2349
01:16:02,960 --> 01:16:06,719
is it through policy or is it through

2350
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:09,039
like phone conversations

2351
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,719
is there any cool kind of insights that

2352
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:14,319
you can speak to yeah kissinger

2353
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:16,719
is the uh ultimate kiss-up

2354
01:16:14,319 --> 01:16:17,439
he is some used to make fun of him in

2355
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:20,158
fact even

2356
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:22,079
the film the the filmmaker uh from dr

2357
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:23,599
strangelove who's name i'm forgetting uh

2358
01:16:22,079 --> 01:16:25,600
right stanley kubrick

2359
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,199
called him kiss up at that time he was

2360
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:30,079
right um

2361
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:31,279
he had a wonderful way of figuring out

2362
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,439
what it is you wanted

2363
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:35,279
back to that discussion we had before

2364
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:36,719
and trying to show how he could give you

2365
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:38,559
more of what you wanted as a leader it

2366
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:41,600
was very personalistic

2367
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:43,520
uh very personalistic and uh he spends a

2368
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,360
lot of time for example kissing up to

2369
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:47,280
leonid brezhnev

2370
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,799
kissing up to mao he tells mao you're

2371
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:50,479
the greatest leader in the history of

2372
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,560
the 20th century people will look back

2373
01:16:50,479 --> 01:16:54,559
on you as the great leader

2374
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,880
some of this sounds like bs but it's

2375
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:58,400
serious right he's feeding the egos of

2376
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:01,760
those around him

2377
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:02,960
second he is willing to get things done

2378
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:04,480
for you he's effective

2379
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:07,039
you want him around you because of his

2380
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:08,559
efficacy so richard nixon is always

2381
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:10,079
suspicious that henry kissinger is

2382
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,440
getting more of the limelight he hates

2383
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:12,559
that kissinger gets the nobel peace

2384
01:17:11,439 --> 01:17:14,639
prize and he doesn't

2385
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,640
but he needs him because kissinger is

2386
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,520
the guy who gets things done so he

2387
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,679
performs

2388
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,040
he builds a relationship in almost i say

2389
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:22,319
this in the book in almost a gangster

2390
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:23,359
way he didn't like that he criticized

2391
01:17:22,319 --> 01:17:24,880
that part of the book but

2392
01:17:23,359 --> 01:17:26,399
again i still think the evidence is

2393
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,079
there

2394
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:29,679
you need something to be done boss i'll

2395
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:31,198
do it

2396
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,359
and don't forget that i'm doing this for

2397
01:17:31,198 --> 01:17:34,559
you and you get mutual dependency in a

2398
01:17:33,359 --> 01:17:38,079
hegelian way right

2399
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:40,719
yeah and and and so he builds this

2400
01:17:38,079 --> 01:17:42,399
uh personal dependency through ego and

2401
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:46,000
through performance

2402
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:46,719
and then he's so skillful at making

2403
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,479
decisions

2404
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:49,920
for people who are more powerful because

2405
01:17:48,479 --> 01:17:51,599
he's never elected to office he always

2406
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:53,920
needs powerful people to

2407
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,679
let him do things but he convinces you

2408
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,760
it's your decision when it's really his

2409
01:17:55,679 --> 01:17:59,679
to read his memos are beautiful he's

2410
01:17:57,760 --> 01:18:00,400
actually very skilled at writing things

2411
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,319
in a way that

2412
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:03,599
look looks like he's giving you options

2413
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:05,039
as president

2414
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:06,719
but in fact there's only one option

2415
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:09,039
there

2416
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,640
is he speaking to the gangster to the

2417
01:18:09,039 --> 01:18:13,439
loyalty

2418
01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:14,079
is he ever like the sense i got from

2419
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:17,039
nixon

2420
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,559
is he would nixon would backstab you if

2421
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:22,238
he needed to

2422
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:25,520
uh one of the things that

2423
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:28,079
i admire about gangsters

2424
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:30,080
is they don't backstab those in the

2425
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:32,640
inner circle like loyalty above it all

2426
01:18:30,079 --> 01:18:34,399
else i mean at least that's uh the sense

2427
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:37,119
i've gotten from

2428
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:38,719
the stories of the past at least is uh

2429
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:41,760
where would you put kissinger on that

2430
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:45,119
is he loyalty above all all else

2431
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,960
or is it our human it's like the steve

2432
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:48,640
jobs thing is like as long as you're

2433
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:51,920
useful you're useful but then

2434
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:52,960
once long the moment you're no longer

2435
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:55,359
useful is uh

2436
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,480
when you're knocked off the chessboard

2437
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:59,519
it's the latter with him

2438
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:02,479
he he's backstabbing quite a lot

2439
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:04,159
and he's self-serving um but he also

2440
01:19:02,479 --> 01:19:05,599
makes himself so useful that even though

2441
01:19:04,158 --> 01:19:09,279
nixon knows he's doing that

2442
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:11,920
nixon still needs him yeah

2443
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:13,279
by the way on that a point so having

2444
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:15,199
spoken with kissinger

2445
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:16,639
what's your relationship like with him

2446
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:20,079
as somebody who is

2447
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:23,119
in an objective way writing

2448
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:25,679
his story it was very difficult because

2449
01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:26,559
uh he's very good at manipulating people

2450
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:29,760
and uh

2451
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:33,360
we had about 12 or 13 interviews usually

2452
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:35,119
informal over lunch um and um

2453
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:36,639
and this was many years ago but this is

2454
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:40,079
probably not more than 10 years ago

2455
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:41,280
um did you find yourself being like

2456
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:43,519
sweet talked

2457
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:44,800
like to where you like go back home

2458
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,400
later and look in the mirror it's like

2459
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:49,119
wait what just happened

2460
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:51,039
he can be enormously charming and

2461
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:53,198
enormously obnoxious at the same time so

2462
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:55,519
i would have these very mixed emotions

2463
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:56,879
because he gives no ground he he's

2464
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,880
unwilling to

2465
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,319
and i think this is a weakness he's

2466
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:03,440
unwilling to

2467
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:05,119
um admit mistake

2468
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:06,799
others make mistakes but he doesn't and

2469
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:08,399
he certainly won't take on any of the

2470
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:09,920
big criticisms that are

2471
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:11,359
that are pushed i understand why i mean

2472
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,520
when you've worked as hard for what he

2473
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,799
has as he has you're defensive about it

2474
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:16,159
but he is very defensive he's very

2475
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:17,520
fragile about he does not like

2476
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:19,359
criticisms at all

2477
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:21,440
he he used to he hasn't done this in a

2478
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:23,359
while but he used to call me up and

2479
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:24,960
yell at me on the phone quite literally

2480
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:26,559
when i would be quoted in the new york

2481
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:27,920
times or somewhere

2482
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:29,840
saying something that sounded critical

2483
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:32,639
of him so for instance there was one

2484
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,319
instance a number of years ago where

2485
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:35,760
a reporter came across some documents

2486
01:20:34,319 --> 01:20:36,238
where kissinger said negative things

2487
01:20:35,760 --> 01:20:38,560
about

2488
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:39,919
jews in russia typical things that a

2489
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:42,480
german jew would say about

2490
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:43,199
east european jews and the new york

2491
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:45,839
times asked me

2492
01:20:43,198 --> 01:20:47,198
is this accurate and i said yeah the

2493
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:49,039
documents are accurate i've seen them

2494
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:50,559
they're accurate he was so angry

2495
01:20:49,039 --> 01:20:52,000
about that so so there's the fragility

2496
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,920
but there's also the enormous charm and

2497
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,279
enormous intelligence um the real

2498
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,960
challenge with him though is

2499
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:58,719
he's very good at making his case he'll

2500
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:02,079
convince you

2501
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:03,600
and as a scholar as an observer

2502
01:21:02,079 --> 01:21:05,119
you don't want to hear a lawyer's case

2503
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,960
you want to actually interrogate the

2504
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:08,238
evidence and get to the truth

2505
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,800
and so that was a real challenge with

2506
01:21:08,238 --> 01:21:14,079
him so speaking of his

2507
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:16,079
approach of real politics

2508
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:18,719
if we just zoom out and look at human

2509
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:22,719
history human civilization

2510
01:21:18,719 --> 01:21:25,679
what do you think works best in um

2511
01:21:22,719 --> 01:21:27,198
in the way we progress forward a

2512
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,520
realistic approach

2513
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:30,399
do whatever it takes control the centers

2514
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:33,199
of power

2515
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:34,079
to play a game for the for the greater

2516
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:37,678
interests

2517
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:42,158
of the good guys quote unquote or

2518
01:21:37,679 --> 01:21:45,279
lead by a sort of idealism which is um

2519
01:21:42,158 --> 01:21:48,000
like truly act in the wa

2520
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:50,079
in the best version of the ideas you

2521
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:52,960
represent as opposed to kind of

2522
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:54,479
uh present one view and then do whatever

2523
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:56,000
it takes

2524
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:57,439
behind the scenes obviously you need

2525
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:59,198
some of both but i lean more to the

2526
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,000
idealistic side and more so actually

2527
01:21:59,198 --> 01:22:03,039
believe it or not

2528
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:04,319
the as as i get into my 40s uh as i do

2529
01:22:03,039 --> 01:22:06,238
more historical work

2530
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:07,439
why do i say that because i think and

2531
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:08,638
this is one of my criticisms of

2532
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:11,359
kissinger who i also have a lot of

2533
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:13,039
respect for the realpolitik becomes

2534
01:22:11,359 --> 01:22:14,559
self-defeating

2535
01:22:13,039 --> 01:22:17,039
because you're constantly running to

2536
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,960
keep power but you forget why

2537
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:20,238
and you often then use power and i think

2538
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:21,760
kissinger falls into this

2539
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:23,359
in some of his worst moments not all of

2540
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,639
his moments where the power is actually

2541
01:22:23,359 --> 01:22:25,439
being used to undermine the things you

2542
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:26,719
care about

2543
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:28,799
it's sort of the example of being a

2544
01:22:26,719 --> 01:22:30,399
parent and you're doing all these things

2545
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,159
to you know take your kid to violin

2546
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:33,359
basketball all these things

2547
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:34,638
and you realize you're actually killing

2548
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:35,439
your kid and making your kid very

2549
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:36,639
unhappy

2550
01:22:35,439 --> 01:22:39,039
and the whole reason you were doing it

2551
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:41,279
was to improve the person's life yeah

2552
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:43,279
and so you have to remember why it is

2553
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,039
what what hans morgan thou calls this is

2554
01:22:43,279 --> 01:22:45,679
your purpose your purpose has to drive

2555
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:47,359
you

2556
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:49,119
now your purpose doesn't have to be airy

2557
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:51,679
fairy idealism

2558
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:53,119
so i believe deeply and democracy isn't

2559
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,480
ideal

2560
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:56,639
i don't think it's going to ever look

2561
01:22:54,479 --> 01:23:00,079
like athenian democracy

2562
01:22:56,639 --> 01:23:01,520
but that should drive our policy

2563
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:02,880
but we still have to be realistic and

2564
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:06,159
recognize we're not going to build that

2565
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:07,840
democracy in afghanistan tomorrow i mean

2566
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:09,519
does it ultimately just boil down again

2567
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:13,440
to the corrupting nature of power

2568
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:16,960
that um nobody can

2569
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:18,399
hold power for very long before you

2570
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:21,279
start

2571
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:22,000
acting in the in the interest of power

2572
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:24,238
as opposed to

2573
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,198
in the interest of your ideals it's

2574
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:28,158
impossible

2575
01:23:25,198 --> 01:23:28,799
to be like somebody like kissinger who

2576
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:30,960
is

2577
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,560
essentially in power for many many

2578
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,679
decades

2579
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:40,480
and and still remember what are the

2580
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:44,000
initial ideals that you strove to um

2581
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:45,839
to achieve yes i think that's exactly

2582
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,198
right there there's a moment in the book

2583
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:49,039
i quote

2584
01:23:47,198 --> 01:23:50,719
about him comes from one of our

2585
01:23:49,039 --> 01:23:52,960
interviews i asked him

2586
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:54,158
what were the guiding ideals for your

2587
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,480
policies

2588
01:23:54,158 --> 01:23:57,279
and he said uh i can't i'm not prepared

2589
01:23:56,479 --> 01:23:58,399
to share that

2590
01:23:57,279 --> 01:23:59,759
and i don't think it's because he

2591
01:23:58,399 --> 01:24:00,559
doesn't know what he thinks he was

2592
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:02,880
trying to do

2593
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:03,840
he realizes his use of power departed

2594
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:07,039
quite a lot

2595
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:08,639
from so he it would sound if he

2596
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:11,840
made them explicit he would sound

2597
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:11,840
hypocritical correct

2598
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:19,279
well on that let me ask about war

2599
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,000
america often presents itself to its own

2600
01:24:19,279 --> 01:24:21,840
people

2601
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:24,000
but just the leaders when they look in

2602
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,840
the mirror is i get a sense

2603
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,158
that we think of ourselves as the good

2604
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,159
guys

2605
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:35,600
in especially this begins sometimes

2606
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,920
to look hypocritical when you're waging

2607
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,920
war

2608
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:42,158
is what's a good um is there a good way

2609
01:24:41,119 --> 01:24:45,279
to know

2610
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:48,479
when you've lost all sense of what it is

2611
01:24:45,279 --> 01:24:51,279
to be good um

2612
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:53,759
another way to ask that is there in

2613
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:56,238
military policy in conducting war

2614
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:57,440
is there a good way to know what is a

2615
01:24:56,238 --> 01:25:00,638
just war

2616
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:03,919
and uh what is a war crime i mean

2617
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,880
in some circles kissinger is accused of

2618
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:07,920
contributing

2619
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:09,359
you know being a war criminal yes i i

2620
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,279
and and i argue in the book he's not a

2621
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:14,719
war criminal but that doesn't mean that

2622
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:17,840
um he didn't misuse military power

2623
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:20,639
um i i think um

2624
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:23,039
a just war war just war as michael walls

2625
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:25,840
and others write about it a just war

2626
01:25:23,039 --> 01:25:28,479
is a war where both the purpose is just

2627
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:29,679
and you are using the means to get to

2628
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:32,718
that purpose

2629
01:25:29,679 --> 01:25:34,000
that uh kill as few people as

2630
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,920
necessary that doesn't mean they won't

2631
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,960
be killing but as few as necessary

2632
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:38,560
proportionality

2633
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,480
right your your means should be

2634
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:43,360
proportional to your ends

2635
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:45,599
and um that's often lost sight of

2636
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:49,359
because the drive to get to the end

2637
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:51,360
often self-justifies means that go well

2638
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:54,158
beyond that and so that's that's that's

2639
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:55,119
how we get into torture in the war on

2640
01:25:54,158 --> 01:25:57,119
terror

2641
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:58,800
right is there some kind of lesson for

2642
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:00,800
the future

2643
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:03,119
yes you can take away from that yes i

2644
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:04,719
think the the the first set of lessons

2645
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:06,880
that i've shared as a historian with

2646
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:08,000
with military decision makers is first

2647
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:09,359
of all always remember why

2648
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,359
you're there what your purpose is and

2649
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:12,479
always ask yourself if the means you're

2650
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:14,000
using

2651
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:16,158
are actually proportional ask that

2652
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,679
question just because you have these

2653
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:19,198
means that you can use just because you

2654
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:21,199
have these tools

2655
01:26:19,198 --> 01:26:23,119
doesn't mean they're the right tools to

2656
01:26:21,198 --> 01:26:25,439
use and here's the

2657
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:26,800
question that follows from that and it's

2658
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:28,238
a it's a hard question to ask because

2659
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,199
the answer is one we often don't like to

2660
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:32,079
hear

2661
01:26:29,198 --> 01:26:33,839
are the things i'm doing in war actually

2662
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:37,279
doing more harm or more good

2663
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:38,800
to the reason i went into war we came to

2664
01:26:37,279 --> 01:26:39,920
a point in the war on terror

2665
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,719
where what we were doing was actually

2666
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:45,840
creating more terrorists

2667
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:45,840
and that's when you have to stop

2668
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,279
well some of that is in the data but

2669
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:51,280
some of it there's a leap of faith

2670
01:26:49,279 --> 01:26:53,119
so from a parenting perspective let me

2671
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:53,759
let me speak as a person with no kids in

2672
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:56,559
the

2673
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:58,000
single guy let me be the expert in the

2674
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:01,760
room i'm parenting

2675
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:03,600
no uh it does seem

2676
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:05,920
that it's a very difficult thing to do

2677
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:08,960
to um

2678
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:11,279
even though you know that your

2679
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:12,800
kid was making a mistake to let them

2680
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:15,279
make a mistake to give them the freedom

2681
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:17,279
to make the mistakes sure

2682
01:27:15,279 --> 01:27:18,479
i don't know what to do but i mean

2683
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:20,880
that's a very kind of

2684
01:27:18,479 --> 01:27:22,879
light-hearted way of phrasing the

2685
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:25,840
following which is

2686
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:29,520
when you look at some of the places in

2687
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:33,440
the world like afghanistan which is

2688
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:35,120
not doing well right to move out

2689
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:36,559
knowing that there's going to be a lot

2690
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:39,920
of suffering

2691
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:42,800
economic suffering injustices

2692
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,800
terrorist organizations growing that

2693
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,560
committing crimes on its own people and

2694
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:50,079
potentially committing crimes

2695
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:53,600
against allies violence against allies

2696
01:27:50,079 --> 01:27:56,800
violence against the united states

2697
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:59,840
um how do you know what to do in that

2698
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:01,520
case well

2699
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:02,960
again it's an art not a science which is

2700
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:03,920
what makes it hard for you know an

2701
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,359
engineer to

2702
01:28:03,920 --> 01:28:07,039
to think about this is what what makes

2703
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:08,639
it endlessly fascinating for me yeah

2704
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:10,319
and i think the real intellectual work

2705
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:12,239
is at the level of the art

2706
01:28:10,319 --> 01:28:13,679
right and i think probably engineering

2707
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:14,000
at its highest level becomes an art as

2708
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:16,399
well

2709
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:17,039
right so policy making you never you

2710
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:19,359
never know

2711
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:20,960
um but i will say this i'll say you have

2712
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:21,920
to ask yourself and look in the mirror

2713
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,439
and say

2714
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,359
is all the effort i'm putting in

2715
01:28:23,439 --> 01:28:27,599
actually making this better

2716
01:28:25,359 --> 01:28:28,639
and in afghanistan you look at the 20

2717
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,520
years and

2718
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:32,639
two plus trillion dollars that the u.s

2719
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,800
has put in

2720
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:36,400
and the fact that as you said correctly

2721
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:38,400
it's not doing well right now after 20

2722
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:40,638
years of that investment

2723
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:41,599
you know i might like a company that i

2724
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:43,279
invest in

2725
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,960
but after 20 years of my throwing money

2726
01:28:43,279 --> 01:28:46,479
in that company

2727
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,639
you know it's time to get out well in

2728
01:28:46,479 --> 01:28:51,839
some sense getting out now

2729
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:53,600
is um that's kind of obvious i'm more

2730
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,159
interested in how we figure out in the

2731
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,960
future

2732
01:28:54,158 --> 01:28:57,599
how to get out earlier then i mean at

2733
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,198
this point

2734
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:01,199
we've stayed too long and it's obvious

2735
01:28:59,198 --> 01:29:04,238
the data the the investment

2736
01:29:01,198 --> 01:29:06,479
nothing is working you know it's very

2737
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:09,359
the very little data points to us

2738
01:29:06,479 --> 01:29:10,000
is staying there i'm more interested in

2739
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:12,238
uh

2740
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,920
you know being in a relation let me take

2741
01:29:12,238 --> 01:29:15,599
it back to a safer place again being in

2742
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,279
a relationship and getting out of that

2743
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,719
relationship while things are still good

2744
01:29:17,279 --> 01:29:20,238
but you have a sense that it's not going

2745
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:22,319
to end up in a good place

2746
01:29:20,238 --> 01:29:23,439
that's that's the difficult thing you

2747
01:29:22,319 --> 01:29:24,960
have to ask yourself

2748
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:26,479
whether it's a relationship or you're

2749
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,079
talking about policy making in a place

2750
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:30,959
like afghanistan

2751
01:29:28,079 --> 01:29:32,559
are the things i'm doing showing me

2752
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:34,079
evidence real evidence that they're

2753
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:36,000
making things better

2754
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:37,600
or making things worse that's a hard

2755
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:39,760
question to be honest with you you have

2756
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:40,560
to be very honest and in a policy making

2757
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:41,840
context

2758
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,360
we have to actually do the same thing we

2759
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,800
do in a relationship context what do we

2760
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:46,158
do in relationship context we ask other

2761
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:48,159
friends who are observing

2762
01:29:46,158 --> 01:29:49,439
right we ask for other observers this is

2763
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:50,559
actually just a scientific method

2764
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:52,638
element actually right

2765
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,320
that we can't the heisenberg principle i

2766
01:29:52,639 --> 01:29:55,279
i can't see it because i'm too close to

2767
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:58,079
it i'm changing it

2768
01:29:55,279 --> 01:30:00,399
by my looking at it right i need others

2769
01:29:58,079 --> 01:30:01,840
to tell me in a policy making context

2770
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:04,319
this is why you need to hear from other

2771
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:05,679
people not just the generals because

2772
01:30:04,319 --> 01:30:07,920
here's the thing about the generals

2773
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:10,000
they're they generally are patriotic

2774
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:11,279
hard-working people but they're too

2775
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,880
close

2776
01:30:11,279 --> 01:30:14,319
they're not lying they're too close they

2777
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:19,679
always think they can do better

2778
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:24,000
yeah how do you think about the cold war

2779
01:30:19,679 --> 01:30:27,039
now from the beginning to end and maybe

2780
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:31,119
also with an eye towards the current

2781
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:32,719
potential cyber conflict cyber war with

2782
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:34,960
china and with russia

2783
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:37,679
if we look sort of other kind of cold

2784
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:38,639
wars potentially emerging in the 21st

2785
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:40,960
century

2786
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:43,119
when you look back at the cold war of

2787
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:45,279
the 20th century

2788
01:30:43,119 --> 01:30:46,719
how do you see it and what lessons do we

2789
01:30:45,279 --> 01:30:48,719
draw from it

2790
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:50,399
it's a wonderful question because i

2791
01:30:48,719 --> 01:30:50,800
teach this to undergraduates and it's

2792
01:30:50,399 --> 01:30:52,799
really

2793
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,079
interesting to see how undergraduates

2794
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,560
now

2795
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:57,119
almost all of whom were born after 9 11.

2796
01:30:56,560 --> 01:30:59,199
yeah

2797
01:30:57,119 --> 01:31:00,559
uh so the cold war is ancient history to

2798
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:03,439
them in fact

2799
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:04,560
yeah the cold war to them is as far

2800
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:07,519
removed

2801
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,840
as you know the 1950s were to me i mean

2802
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:09,840
that's

2803
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:11,520
the you know that's it's it's

2804
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:13,679
unbelievable it's almost like

2805
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,360
world war ii for my generation and cold

2806
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,719
war and cold war for them it's so far

2807
01:31:15,359 --> 01:31:18,479
removed the collapse of the soviet union

2808
01:31:16,719 --> 01:31:21,600
doesn't mean anything to them

2809
01:31:18,479 --> 01:31:23,439
um so uh so how do you how do you

2810
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:25,440
describe the cold war to them how do you

2811
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:27,599
describe the soviet union to them

2812
01:31:25,439 --> 01:31:30,559
first of all i have to explain to them

2813
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,400
why people were so fearful of communism

2814
01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:34,000
anti-communism is very hard for them to

2815
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:37,039
understand

2816
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,158
um the fact that in the 1950s americans

2817
01:31:37,039 --> 01:31:39,840
believed

2818
01:31:38,158 --> 01:31:41,839
that communists were going to infiltrate

2819
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:43,360
our society and many other societies and

2820
01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:46,400
that after

2821
01:31:43,359 --> 01:31:48,158
fidel castro comes to power in 1959 that

2822
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:49,679
we're going to see communist regimes all

2823
01:31:48,158 --> 01:31:51,439
across latin america

2824
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:53,600
that fear of communism married to

2825
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,599
nuclear power

2826
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:57,280
and then even the fear that maybe

2827
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:58,639
economically they would outpace us

2828
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:01,679
because they would create this sort of

2829
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:03,279
army of khrushchevian you know creep

2830
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,199
builders of things and you know what as

2831
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:06,800
khrushchev said right say we're going to

2832
01:32:05,198 --> 01:32:08,238
catch britain in five years and then the

2833
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:10,800
united states after that

2834
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:12,000
right so to to explain that sense of

2835
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:15,119
fear to them that they don't

2836
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,560
have of those others that's really

2837
01:32:15,119 --> 01:32:18,158
uh important the cold war was

2838
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:20,719
fundamentally uh

2839
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:22,719
about the united states defending a

2840
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:25,039
capitalist world order against a

2841
01:32:22,719 --> 01:32:26,158
serious challenger from communism an

2842
01:32:25,039 --> 01:32:28,158
alternative way

2843
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:29,920
of organizing everything private

2844
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:32,719
property economic

2845
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:34,319
activity enterprise life everything

2846
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:36,719
organized in a totally different way it

2847
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:38,399
was a struggle between two systems

2848
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:39,920
so your senses and started to interrupt

2849
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:42,000
but your sense is

2850
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:44,719
the the conflict of the cold war was

2851
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:47,198
between two ideologies

2852
01:32:44,719 --> 01:32:48,319
and not just two big countries with

2853
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:49,519
nuclear weapons

2854
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:51,439
i think it was about two different ways

2855
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:53,199
of life or two different um

2856
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:54,719
promoted ways of life the soviet union

2857
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:57,839
never actually

2858
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:59,520
lived communism yes but i i think my

2859
01:32:57,840 --> 01:33:01,119
reading of stalin is he really tried to

2860
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:02,960
go there that and khrushchev

2861
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:04,559
really believed gorbachev thought he was

2862
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,158
going to reform the soviet union so you

2863
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:06,960
would go back to a kind of bukhar and

2864
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:09,839
lenin

2865
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:11,119
communism right so um i do think that

2866
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,319
mattered i do think that mattered

2867
01:33:11,119 --> 01:33:13,359
enormously and from the united states

2868
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:16,000
point of view

2869
01:33:13,359 --> 01:33:16,639
um the view was that communism and

2870
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,600
fascism

2871
01:33:16,639 --> 01:33:21,359
were these totalitarian threats to

2872
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:22,560
liberal democracy and capitalism which

2873
01:33:21,359 --> 01:33:24,000
went hand in hand

2874
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:25,600
so i do think that's what the struggle

2875
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,479
was about and in a certain way liberal

2876
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:28,239
capitalism

2877
01:33:26,479 --> 01:33:30,319
proved to be the more enduring system in

2878
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:32,479
the united states played a key role

2879
01:33:30,319 --> 01:33:33,359
in that that that's the reality of the

2880
01:33:32,479 --> 01:33:34,879
cold war

2881
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:36,719
but i think it means different things

2882
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:39,760
now to my students

2883
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:43,359
and others they focus uh

2884
01:33:39,760 --> 01:33:43,920
very much on the expansion of american

2885
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:47,198
power

2886
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:48,399
and the challenges of managing

2887
01:33:47,198 --> 01:33:50,238
they're looking at it from the

2888
01:33:48,399 --> 01:33:52,799
perspective of not

2889
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:53,599
will we survive but did we waste our

2890
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:55,119
resources

2891
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,800
on some elements of it it doesn't mean

2892
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:58,559
they were against what america

2893
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,560
did but there is a question of the

2894
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:02,800
resources that went into the cold war

2895
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,400
and the opportunity costs

2896
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,920
and you see this when you look at the

2897
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:07,359
sort of health care systems that other

2898
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,560
countries build and you compare them to

2899
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:11,519
the united states

2900
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:12,880
race issues also um so they they look at

2901
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,719
the costs which i think

2902
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,400
often happens after a project is done

2903
01:34:14,719 --> 01:34:18,560
you look back at that

2904
01:34:16,399 --> 01:34:19,759
second i think um they're also more

2905
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:23,280
inclined

2906
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:25,600
to see the world as less bipolar

2907
01:34:23,279 --> 01:34:26,559
to see uh the role of china as more

2908
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:29,440
complicated

2909
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,760
post colonial or anti-colonial movements

2910
01:34:29,439 --> 01:34:31,759
uh

2911
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:34,079
independent states in africa and latin

2912
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:37,119
america that gets more attention

2913
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:40,238
so one of the criticisms now

2914
01:34:37,119 --> 01:34:42,238
is because you forget the the lessons of

2915
01:34:40,238 --> 01:34:44,238
20th century history

2916
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:45,439
and the atrocities committed under

2917
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:47,839
communism

2918
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:50,319
that you may be a little bit more

2919
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,960
willing to

2920
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:54,559
accept some of those ideologies into our

2921
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:57,920
the united states society

2922
01:34:54,560 --> 01:35:00,000
that this kind of um that forgetting

2923
01:34:57,920 --> 01:35:03,039
that capitalistic forces

2924
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:06,238
are part of the reason why

2925
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:07,198
we have what we have today there's a

2926
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:10,799
fear

2927
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:14,879
amongst some now that we would

2928
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:18,159
have we would allow basically communism

2929
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:20,000
to take hold in america i mean

2930
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:21,279
jordan and others speak to this kind of

2931
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:24,560
idea i tend to

2932
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:25,359
not be so fearful of it i think it's on

2933
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,960
the surface

2934
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:29,359
it's not deep within i do see the world

2935
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:32,000
as

2936
01:35:29,359 --> 01:35:33,359
very complicated as a as there needing

2937
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,679
to be a role of

2938
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:37,279
having support for each other on certain

2939
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:37,920
political levels economic levels and

2940
01:35:37,279 --> 01:35:41,279
then

2941
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:44,800
also supporting entrepreneurs it's like

2942
01:35:41,279 --> 01:35:46,479
um that the kind of enforcing of

2943
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,679
outcomes that is fundamental to the

2944
01:35:46,479 --> 01:35:49,919
communist system

2945
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:51,920
is not something we're actually close to

2946
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,560
and some of that is just fear-mongering

2947
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:55,199
for

2948
01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:56,320
for uh for likes on twitter kind of

2949
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:57,439
thing

2950
01:35:56,319 --> 01:35:59,279
if i could come in on that because i

2951
01:35:57,439 --> 01:35:59,678
agree with you 100 i've spent a lot of

2952
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:01,279
time

2953
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:03,039
writing and looking at this and talking

2954
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:04,399
to people about this um

2955
01:36:03,039 --> 01:36:06,319
there's no communism in the united

2956
01:36:04,399 --> 01:36:07,519
states there never has been and there

2957
01:36:06,319 --> 01:36:09,519
certainly isn't now and

2958
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,560
and i'll say this both from an academic

2959
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,080
point of view but also from just

2960
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,280
spending a lot of time observing young

2961
01:36:12,079 --> 01:36:14,960
people in the united states

2962
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:16,800
even those on the farthest left take

2963
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,840
whoever you think is the farthest left

2964
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,600
they don't even understand what

2965
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,560
communism is they're not communist in

2966
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:22,400
any sense

2967
01:36:20,560 --> 01:36:23,840
americans are raised in a vernacular and

2968
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:24,799
environment of private property

2969
01:36:23,840 --> 01:36:26,719
ownership

2970
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:27,760
and as you know better than anyone if

2971
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:29,840
you believe in private property you

2972
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:32,159
don't believe in communism so

2973
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:32,880
the what what the sort of bernie sanders

2974
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:35,839
kind of

2975
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:36,480
socialist elements that's very different

2976
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:38,319
right

2977
01:36:36,479 --> 01:36:40,479
and i would say some of that not all of

2978
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:42,559
that some of that does harken back

2979
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:44,479
to actually what won in the cold war

2980
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:46,080
there were many social democratic

2981
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:47,919
elements of what the united states did

2982
01:36:46,079 --> 01:36:51,039
that led to our winning the cold war

2983
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:53,760
for example the new deal uh

2984
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:54,880
was investing government money in

2985
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:58,000
propping up business

2986
01:36:54,880 --> 01:37:00,000
in propping up labor unions and

2987
01:36:58,000 --> 01:37:02,158
during the cold war we spent more money

2988
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:05,920
than we had ever spent in our history

2989
01:37:02,158 --> 01:37:07,439
on infrastructure on schools uh on

2990
01:37:05,920 --> 01:37:09,600
providing social support

2991
01:37:07,439 --> 01:37:11,759
social security our national pension

2992
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:14,159
system being one of them

2993
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,199
so you could argue actually that social

2994
01:37:14,158 --> 01:37:17,920
democracy

2995
01:37:15,198 --> 01:37:19,118
is very compatible with capitalism and i

2996
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:20,880
think that's the debate we're having

2997
01:37:19,118 --> 01:37:22,158
today how much social democracy i'd also

2998
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:23,679
say that the capitalism we've

2999
01:37:22,158 --> 01:37:24,719
experienced the last

3000
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:26,800
20 years is different from the

3001
01:37:24,719 --> 01:37:28,319
capitalism of the cold war uh

3002
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,880
during the cold war there was the

3003
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:34,158
presumption in the united states

3004
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:36,960
that you had to

3005
01:37:34,158 --> 01:37:38,079
pay taxes to support our cold war

3006
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,480
activities

3007
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:42,079
that it was okay to make money but the

3008
01:37:40,479 --> 01:37:43,118
more money you made the more taxes you

3009
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:45,359
had to pay

3010
01:37:43,118 --> 01:37:48,319
um we had the highest marginal tax rates

3011
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:50,799
in our history during the cold war

3012
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:52,399
now the aversion to taxes and of course

3013
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:54,480
no one ever likes paying taxes but the

3014
01:37:52,399 --> 01:37:55,359
notion that we can do things on deficit

3015
01:37:54,479 --> 01:37:58,319
spending that's

3016
01:37:55,359 --> 01:38:00,319
a post-cold war phenomenon that's not a

3017
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:01,679
cold war phenomenon so

3018
01:38:00,319 --> 01:38:02,559
so much of the capitalism that we're

3019
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:04,560
talking about today is not the

3020
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:07,039
capitalism of the cold war and maybe

3021
01:38:04,560 --> 01:38:08,000
again we can learn that and see that see

3022
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:10,639
how we can

3023
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,760
reform capitalism today and and and get

3024
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:14,400
rid of this

3025
01:38:11,760 --> 01:38:15,280
false worry about communism in the

3026
01:38:14,399 --> 01:38:16,719
united states yeah you know

3027
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:18,479
you make me actually realize something

3028
01:38:16,719 --> 01:38:20,880
important what we have to remember

3029
01:38:18,479 --> 01:38:22,319
is the words we use on the surface about

3030
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,840
different policies what you think is

3031
01:38:22,319 --> 01:38:26,799
right and wrong

3032
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:28,239
is actually different than the core

3033
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:30,400
thing

3034
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:31,599
that like is in your blood the core

3035
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:34,719
ideas that

3036
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:36,800
are there of i i do see

3037
01:38:34,719 --> 01:38:38,880
the united states as this there there's

3038
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:42,000
this fire that burns

3039
01:38:38,880 --> 01:38:46,079
of individual freedoms of

3040
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:48,238
uh of of of property rights

3041
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:50,000
these these basic foundational ideas

3042
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:50,799
that everybody just kind of takes for

3043
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:54,479
granted

3044
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:57,520
and i think if you hold on to them

3045
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:58,559
if you're like raised in them talking

3046
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:02,080
about

3047
01:38:58,560 --> 01:39:04,960
ideas of social security of universal

3048
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:05,679
basic income of of of reallocation of

3049
01:39:04,960 --> 01:39:07,679
resources

3050
01:39:05,679 --> 01:39:09,520
is a fundamentally different kind of

3051
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:10,560
discussion than you had in the soviet

3052
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:13,760
union

3053
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:16,320
i think the value of the individual is

3054
01:39:13,760 --> 01:39:18,880
so core to the american system

3055
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:19,920
that you basically cannot possibly do

3056
01:39:18,880 --> 01:39:23,920
the kind of

3057
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:26,000
atrocities that you saw in the in the

3058
01:39:23,920 --> 01:39:27,760
in the soviet union but of course you

3059
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:30,479
never know the slippery slope

3060
01:39:27,760 --> 01:39:32,079
has a way of changing uh changing things

3061
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:32,959
but i do believe the things you're born

3062
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:35,279
with

3063
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:36,960
it's just so core to this country it's

3064
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:37,920
it's part of the

3065
01:39:36,960 --> 01:39:40,719
i don't know what your thoughts are

3066
01:39:37,920 --> 01:39:43,039
where we are in texas i'm

3067
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,480
not necessarily i don't necessarily want

3068
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:46,319
to have a gun control type of

3069
01:39:44,479 --> 01:39:50,000
conversation but

3070
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:50,000
the reason i really like guns

3071
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:54,319
it doesn't make any sense but

3072
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:57,039
philosophically it's

3073
01:39:54,319 --> 01:39:58,479
it's such a declaration of individual

3074
01:39:57,039 --> 01:40:00,560
rights

3075
01:39:58,479 --> 01:40:02,479
that's so different than the

3076
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:04,239
conversations i hear with my russian

3077
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:06,479
family my russian friends

3078
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:08,718
that the gun is is very possible that

3079
01:40:06,479 --> 01:40:10,399
having guns is bad for society in the

3080
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:11,359
sense that like it'll lead to more

3081
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:12,960
violence

3082
01:40:11,359 --> 01:40:14,479
but there's something about this

3083
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:17,679
discussion

3084
01:40:14,479 --> 01:40:22,079
um it that

3085
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:25,039
like that proclaims the value

3086
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:27,039
of my freedom as an individual i'm not

3087
01:40:25,039 --> 01:40:27,519
being eloquent in it but there's very

3088
01:40:27,039 --> 01:40:30,158
few

3089
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,639
debates where whenever people are saying

3090
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:32,238
should

3091
01:40:30,639 --> 01:40:34,239
you have what level of gun control all

3092
01:40:32,238 --> 01:40:37,599
those kinds of things

3093
01:40:34,238 --> 01:40:41,599
what i hear is it's a fight for

3094
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:42,239
how much freedom even if it's stupid

3095
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,760
freedom

3096
01:40:42,238 --> 01:40:45,279
should the individual have i think

3097
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:47,679
that's i think that's what that's what's

3098
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:49,198
articulated quite often i i think uh

3099
01:40:47,679 --> 01:40:50,639
combining your two points which are

3100
01:40:49,198 --> 01:40:51,919
great points i think

3101
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:54,319
there is something about american

3102
01:40:51,920 --> 01:40:56,800
individualism which is deeply ingrained

3103
01:40:54,319 --> 01:40:57,679
uh in our culture in our society and it

3104
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,279
means that

3105
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:01,840
the kinds of bad things that happen are

3106
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:04,238
different usually not as bad but

3107
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,960
but our individualism often covers up

3108
01:41:04,238 --> 01:41:08,319
for

3109
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,840
um vigilante activity and individual

3110
01:41:08,319 --> 01:41:11,599
violence toward people that you wouldn't

3111
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:13,279
have in a more collective culture

3112
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,800
um so in the soviet union it was at a

3113
01:41:13,279 --> 01:41:17,279
much worse scale and it was done by

3114
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,239
by government organizations in the

3115
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:19,679
united states it's

3116
01:41:18,238 --> 01:41:21,919
you know individuals the history of

3117
01:41:19,679 --> 01:41:23,440
lynching in our country for example

3118
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:25,039
sometimes it's individual police

3119
01:41:23,439 --> 01:41:26,638
officers sometimes it's others

3120
01:41:25,039 --> 01:41:28,479
again the vast majority police officers

3121
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:29,440
are good people don't do harm to people

3122
01:41:28,479 --> 01:41:31,839
but there are

3123
01:41:29,439 --> 01:41:32,879
these examples and they they're able to

3124
01:41:31,840 --> 01:41:33,920
fester

3125
01:41:32,880 --> 01:41:36,239
in our society because of our

3126
01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:38,239
individualism now gun ownership

3127
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:39,519
uh is about personal freedom i think for

3128
01:41:38,238 --> 01:41:42,158
a lot of people

3129
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,719
and um there's no doubt that in our

3130
01:41:42,158 --> 01:41:44,399
history

3131
01:41:42,719 --> 01:41:46,239
included in the second amendment which

3132
01:41:44,399 --> 01:41:47,679
can be interpreted in different ways

3133
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:49,039
is the presumption that people should

3134
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:50,239
have the right to defend themselves

3135
01:41:49,039 --> 01:41:50,800
which is what i think you're getting at

3136
01:41:50,238 --> 01:41:52,638
here

3137
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,560
that you should not be completely

3138
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,639
dependent for your defense

3139
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,159
on an entity that might not be there for

3140
01:41:56,639 --> 01:42:01,600
you you should be able to defend

3141
01:41:58,158 --> 01:42:03,679
yourself and guns symbolize that um

3142
01:42:01,600 --> 01:42:05,920
i think that's a fair point but i think

3143
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:08,639
it's also a fair point to say

3144
01:42:05,920 --> 01:42:10,480
that as with everything uh defining what

3145
01:42:08,639 --> 01:42:12,319
self-defense is is really important

3146
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:14,799
so does self-defense mean i can have a

3147
01:42:12,319 --> 01:42:15,920
bazooka does it mean i can have weapons

3148
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:18,639
that are designed

3149
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:20,158
for a military battlefield to mass kill

3150
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:21,199
people that seems to me to be very

3151
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:23,039
different

3152
01:42:21,198 --> 01:42:24,638
from saying i should have a handgun or

3153
01:42:23,039 --> 01:42:27,439
some small arm

3154
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:29,840
to defend myself that distinction alone

3155
01:42:27,439 --> 01:42:32,158
would make a huge difference most of the

3156
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,600
uh mass shootings at least which are a

3157
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:34,879
proportion a smaller proportion of the

3158
01:42:33,600 --> 01:42:36,239
larger gun deaths in the united states

3159
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:37,600
which are larger than any other society

3160
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:39,118
but at least the mass shootings

3161
01:42:37,600 --> 01:42:41,119
are usually perpetrated by people who

3162
01:42:39,118 --> 01:42:43,359
have not self-defense weapons

3163
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:44,719
but mass killing mass killing weapons

3164
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:46,319
and i think i think there's an important

3165
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:47,920
distinction there the constitution talks

3166
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:49,519
about a right to bear arms for a

3167
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:51,118
well-regulated militia when the framers

3168
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:53,199
talked about arms

3169
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:54,880
that did not mean the ability to kill as

3170
01:42:53,198 --> 01:42:56,319
many people as you want to kill

3171
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,840
it meant the ability to defend yourself

3172
01:42:56,319 --> 01:42:59,359
so let's have that conversation i think

3173
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,159
it would be useful as a society

3174
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:04,000
stop talking about guns or no guns what

3175
01:43:02,158 --> 01:43:06,799
is it that we as citizens need

3176
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,840
to feel we can defend ourselves yes yeah

3177
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:09,440
i mean guns

3178
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,960
have this complicated issue that it can

3179
01:43:09,439 --> 01:43:13,599
cause harm to others

3180
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,920
i tend to see sort of maybe indra like

3181
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:18,400
legalization of drugs

3182
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:20,480
i tend to believe that we should have

3183
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:22,719
the freedom to do stupid things

3184
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:23,759
yeah as long as we're not harming lots

3185
01:43:22,719 --> 01:43:25,198
of other people yes

3186
01:43:23,760 --> 01:43:26,800
and then guns of course have the

3187
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:29,279
property that they can be used

3188
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,560
it's not just you know a bazooka i would

3189
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:33,118
argue is pretty stupid

3190
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:34,080
to own for your own self-defense but it

3191
01:43:33,118 --> 01:43:36,079
has the very

3192
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:38,399
negative side effect of being

3193
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:41,679
potentially used to harm other people

3194
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:43,359
and you have to you have to consider

3195
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:44,560
that kind of stuff by the way as a side

3196
01:43:43,359 --> 01:43:47,039
note to the listeners

3197
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:47,920
uh there's been a bunch of people saying

3198
01:43:47,039 --> 01:43:50,960
that uh

3199
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:54,319
lex is way too libertarian for my taste

3200
01:43:50,960 --> 01:43:55,920
no i actually am just struggling with

3201
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:57,599
ideas and sometimes put on different

3202
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,440
hats in these conversations i

3203
01:43:57,600 --> 01:44:00,800
i um think through different ideas

3204
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:01,919
whether they're left right or

3205
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,679
libertarian

3206
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,039
that's true for gun control that's true

3207
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:06,880
for immigration it's true for all of

3208
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:08,719
that i think we should

3209
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:10,079
we should have discussions in the space

3210
01:44:08,719 --> 01:44:12,000
of ideas

3211
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:13,439
versus in the space of bins we put each

3212
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,960
other in labels and we'll put each other

3213
01:44:13,439 --> 01:44:18,638
300

3214
01:44:14,960 --> 01:44:21,760
and also change our minds all the time

3215
01:44:18,639 --> 01:44:23,118
try out say say stupid stuff with the

3216
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:25,600
best of intention

3217
01:44:23,118 --> 01:44:26,158
trying our best to think through it and

3218
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:28,320
then

3219
01:44:26,158 --> 01:44:30,079
after saying it think about it for a few

3220
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:33,198
days and then change your mind

3221
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:34,800
and grow in this way let me ask a

3222
01:44:33,198 --> 01:44:37,519
ridiculous question

3223
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:39,520
when you zoom out when uh human

3224
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:43,199
civilization has destroyed itself and

3225
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:46,159
alien graduate students are studying it

3226
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:47,599
uh like three four five centuries from

3227
01:44:46,158 --> 01:44:48,079
now what do you think will remember

3228
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:51,039
about

3229
01:44:48,079 --> 01:44:53,279
this period period in history the 20th

3230
01:44:51,039 --> 01:44:57,679
century the 21st century

3231
01:44:53,279 --> 01:45:00,158
this this time we had a couple wars

3232
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:02,000
we had a charismatic black president in

3233
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:05,759
the united states

3234
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:07,520
with um a couple pandemics

3235
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:09,119
what do you think will actually stand

3236
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:12,400
the the

3237
01:45:09,118 --> 01:45:15,599
stand out in history no doubt the

3238
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:18,559
uh rapid technological innovation

3239
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:19,600
of the last 20 to 30 years uh how we

3240
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:23,119
created a whole

3241
01:45:19,600 --> 01:45:24,480
virtual universe we didn't have before

3242
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:26,319
and of course that's going to go in

3243
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:27,279
directions you and i can't imagine 50

3244
01:45:26,319 --> 01:45:28,880
years from now

3245
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:30,719
that this will be seen as that origin

3246
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:32,480
moment that when we went from

3247
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:34,239
playing below the rim to playing above

3248
01:45:32,479 --> 01:45:36,559
the rim right to being

3249
01:45:34,238 --> 01:45:39,359
all in person to having a whole virtual

3250
01:45:36,560 --> 01:45:42,320
world and in a strange way the pandemic

3251
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:43,679
was a provocation to move even further

3252
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:44,000
in that direction and we're never going

3253
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:45,760
back

3254
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:47,039
right we're we're going to restore some

3255
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:48,239
of the things we were doing before the

3256
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:49,600
pandemic but we're never going to go

3257
01:45:48,238 --> 01:45:51,759
back to that world we were in before

3258
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:53,440
where every meeting you had to fly

3259
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:55,679
to that place to be in the room with the

3260
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:57,039
people um so this whole virtual world

3261
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:00,239
and the virtual personas

3262
01:45:57,039 --> 01:46:01,760
and avatars and all of that um i think

3263
01:46:00,238 --> 01:46:03,599
that's that's going to be

3264
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:06,159
a big part of how people remember our

3265
01:46:03,600 --> 01:46:07,119
time also the sort of biotechnology

3266
01:46:06,158 --> 01:46:10,238
element of it which

3267
01:46:07,118 --> 01:46:12,238
which the vaccines are part of um it's

3268
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:13,599
amazing how quickly this is the great

3269
01:46:12,238 --> 01:46:15,198
triumph how quickly

3270
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,800
we've produced and distributed these

3271
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:18,399
vaccines and of course their problems

3272
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:21,119
with who's taking them but

3273
01:46:18,399 --> 01:46:22,079
but the reality is i mean this is light

3274
01:46:21,118 --> 01:46:23,599
speed

3275
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:26,399
compared to what it would have been like

3276
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:28,320
not just in 1918 in 1980

3277
01:46:26,399 --> 01:46:29,759
yeah one of the and sorry if i'm

3278
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:31,039
interrupting but one of the

3279
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:32,320
disappointing things about this

3280
01:46:31,039 --> 01:46:34,319
particular time

3281
01:46:32,319 --> 01:46:35,920
is because vaccines like a lot of things

3282
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:39,039
got

3283
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:40,480
politicized used as little pawns in the

3284
01:46:39,039 --> 01:46:42,399
game of politics

3285
01:46:40,479 --> 01:46:45,359
that we don't get the chance to step

3286
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:48,238
back fully at least

3287
01:46:45,359 --> 01:46:50,960
and celebrate the the brilliance of the

3288
01:46:48,238 --> 01:46:54,000
human species that's right

3289
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:55,760
this is yes there are scientists who use

3290
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:59,840
their authority

3291
01:46:55,760 --> 01:47:03,119
improperly that have an ego

3292
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:06,159
that when they're

3293
01:47:03,118 --> 01:47:06,799
within institutions are dishonest with

3294
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:07,920
the public

3295
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:09,760
because they don't trust the

3296
01:47:07,920 --> 01:47:11,199
intelligence of the public they are not

3297
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,639
authentic and transparent

3298
01:47:11,198 --> 01:47:14,399
all the same things you could say about

3299
01:47:12,639 --> 01:47:17,600
humans in any positions of power

3300
01:47:14,399 --> 01:47:18,879
anywhere okay that doesn't mean science

3301
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:21,679
isn't incredible

3302
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:23,520
and um the vaccines i mean i don't i

3303
01:47:21,679 --> 01:47:26,239
don't often talk about it

3304
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,119
because it's so political and it it it's

3305
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:30,718
heartbreaking

3306
01:47:27,118 --> 01:47:33,439
to it's heartbreaking how all the good

3307
01:47:30,719 --> 01:47:34,319
stuff is getting politicized yeah that's

3308
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:37,039
right and it shouldn't be

3309
01:47:34,319 --> 01:47:38,079
it'll seem less political um in the long

3310
01:47:37,039 --> 01:47:40,319
arc of history

3311
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:41,279
it'll see it'll it'll be seen as an

3312
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:43,840
outstanding

3313
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:45,359
accomplishment and as a you know a step

3314
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,039
toward whatever maybe they're doing

3315
01:47:45,359 --> 01:47:48,799
vaccines or something that replaces the

3316
01:47:47,039 --> 01:47:50,560
vaccine in 10 seconds you know at that

3317
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:52,079
point right yeah it'll be seen as a step

3318
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,520
those will be some of the positives

3319
01:47:52,079 --> 01:47:55,439
i think one of the negatives they will

3320
01:47:53,520 --> 01:47:58,719
point to will be um

3321
01:47:55,439 --> 01:48:00,719
our inability at least at this moment to

3322
01:47:58,719 --> 01:48:02,639
manage our environment better how we're

3323
01:48:00,719 --> 01:48:04,239
destroying our living space

3324
01:48:02,639 --> 01:48:06,159
and not doing enough even though we have

3325
01:48:04,238 --> 01:48:06,799
the capabilities to do more to preserve

3326
01:48:06,158 --> 01:48:09,519
or at least

3327
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:11,600
allow a sustainable living space i'm

3328
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,880
confident because i'm an optimist

3329
01:48:11,600 --> 01:48:14,719
that we will get through this and we

3330
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:16,560
will be better at sustaining our

3331
01:48:14,719 --> 01:48:18,639
environment in future decades

3332
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:19,600
and so in terms of environmental policy

3333
01:48:18,639 --> 01:48:22,480
they'll see this

3334
01:48:19,600 --> 01:48:26,079
moment as a dark age or the beginnings

3335
01:48:22,479 --> 01:48:29,839
of a better age maybe as a renaissance

3336
01:48:26,079 --> 01:48:32,158
or maybe uh as a as the last time

3337
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:34,000
most people lived on earth when a couple

3338
01:48:32,158 --> 01:48:35,359
centuries afterwards were all dissipated

3339
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,359
throughout the

3340
01:48:35,359 --> 01:48:39,920
the solar system in the galaxy very

3341
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:42,079
possible if the local resident

3342
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:45,199
hometown resident mr elon musk has

3343
01:48:42,079 --> 01:48:48,319
anything to do with it

3344
01:48:45,198 --> 01:48:49,759
i i do i do tend to think you're

3345
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:50,880
absolutely right with all this political

3346
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:53,039
bickering

3347
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:54,319
we shouldn't forget that what this age

3348
01:48:53,039 --> 01:48:56,238
will be remembered by is

3349
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:57,840
the is the incredible levels of

3350
01:48:56,238 --> 01:49:00,799
innovation yes i do

3351
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:02,480
i do think the biotech stuff worries me

3352
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,079
more than anything

3353
01:49:02,479 --> 01:49:05,359
because it feels like there's a lot of

3354
01:49:04,079 --> 01:49:06,079
weapons that could be yet to be

3355
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:09,679
developed

3356
01:49:06,079 --> 01:49:11,920
in that space but i tend to believe that

3357
01:49:09,679 --> 01:49:14,319
i'm excited about by two avenues one is

3358
01:49:11,920 --> 01:49:18,158
artificial intelligence

3359
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:19,840
the kind of um the kind of systems we'll

3360
01:49:18,158 --> 01:49:21,279
create in this digital space that you

3361
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,360
mentioned we're moving to

3362
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:25,118
and then the other of course this could

3363
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:27,439
be the product of the cold war but i'm

3364
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:30,238
super excited by space exploration sure

3365
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:31,598
there's a magic tour to humans being sp

3366
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:32,319
and we're getting back to it i mean we

3367
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:34,239
we were

3368
01:49:32,319 --> 01:49:35,759
enthralled with it in the 50s and 60s

3369
01:49:34,238 --> 01:49:37,759
when it was a cold war competition and

3370
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:38,159
then after the 70s we sort of gave up on

3371
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,400
it

3372
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:42,079
and thanks to elon musk and others we're

3373
01:49:40,399 --> 01:49:44,719
coming back to this issue and and

3374
01:49:42,079 --> 01:49:47,519
i think there's so much to be gained

3375
01:49:44,719 --> 01:49:50,000
from the power of exploration

3376
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:51,760
is there books or movies in your life

3377
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,039
long ago or recently that had a big

3378
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:56,239
impact on you

3379
01:49:53,039 --> 01:49:58,238
yes something you were yes um

3380
01:49:56,238 --> 01:49:59,678
you know my favorite novel i always tell

3381
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:00,559
people this i love reading novels i'm a

3382
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:02,800
historian

3383
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,840
uh and i think the historian and the

3384
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:05,840
novelist are actually

3385
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,279
and the technology innovator are all

3386
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:09,520
actually one and the same we're all

3387
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:11,439
storytellers storytellers and we're all

3388
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:13,760
in the imagination space

3389
01:50:11,439 --> 01:50:15,598
and um i'm trying to imagine the world

3390
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,639
of the past to inform us in the present

3391
01:50:15,599 --> 01:50:18,639
for the future

3392
01:50:16,639 --> 01:50:20,159
so one of my favorite novels that i read

3393
01:50:18,639 --> 01:50:23,520
actually when i was in graduate school

3394
01:50:20,158 --> 01:50:26,319
is thomas mons button brooks and

3395
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:27,599
it's the story of a family in lubeck in

3396
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:29,359
northern germany

3397
01:50:27,599 --> 01:50:31,599
living through the 19th century and the

3398
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:33,279
rise and fall of families cycles of life

3399
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:34,319
many things we've talked about in the

3400
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:38,079
last couple hours

3401
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:39,679
cycles of life um challenges of uh

3402
01:50:38,079 --> 01:50:42,399
adjusting to the world around you and

3403
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:44,800
it's just a very moving reflection

3404
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:46,000
on the limits of human agency and how we

3405
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:47,679
we all have to

3406
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,039
understand the circumstances we're in

3407
01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:51,440
and adjust to them

3408
01:50:49,039 --> 01:50:53,039
and there's triumph and tragedy in that

3409
01:50:51,439 --> 01:50:54,479
it's a wonderful novel it used to be a

3410
01:50:53,039 --> 01:50:55,439
kind of canonical work it's sort of

3411
01:50:54,479 --> 01:50:58,399
fallen out now

3412
01:50:55,439 --> 01:50:59,118
it's a big big novel but uh i'm very

3413
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:00,638
moved by that

3414
01:50:59,118 --> 01:51:02,399
i'm very moved by tolstoy's war and

3415
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:04,719
peace i assign that every year to my

3416
01:51:02,399 --> 01:51:07,679
students that's a big big book

3417
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:09,840
but what tolstoy challenges is he

3418
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,039
challenges the notion that a napoleon

3419
01:51:09,840 --> 01:51:12,560
can rule the world

3420
01:51:11,039 --> 01:51:13,920
and we're all little napoleons right

3421
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:15,119
we're all sort of thinking that we're

3422
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,719
going to do that

3423
01:51:15,118 --> 01:51:18,319
and he reminds us how much is

3424
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:19,520
contingency circumstance that doesn't

3425
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:22,399
mean we don't have

3426
01:51:19,520 --> 01:51:23,520
some control you've uh spoke to me a

3427
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:25,439
little bit of russian

3428
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:27,360
where does that come from so your your

3429
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:28,799
appreciation of tolstoy but also your

3430
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:29,359
ability to speak a bit of russian where

3431
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:31,199
is that

3432
01:51:29,359 --> 01:51:33,598
where is that from so uh i speak in

3433
01:51:31,198 --> 01:51:35,279
addition to english i speak

3434
01:51:33,599 --> 01:51:36,719
reasonably well depending on how much

3435
01:51:35,279 --> 01:51:39,439
vodka i've had

3436
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:40,319
russian nice french and german um i

3437
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:43,118
learned those

3438
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:44,158
uh for uh research purposes i learned

3439
01:51:43,118 --> 01:51:44,479
french actually when i was in high

3440
01:51:44,158 --> 01:51:46,079
school

3441
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:47,598
russian when i was in college german

3442
01:51:46,079 --> 01:51:49,679
when i was in graduate school

3443
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:51,920
now i do have family on my mother's side

3444
01:51:49,679 --> 01:51:54,079
that's of russian jewish extraction

3445
01:51:51,920 --> 01:51:55,440
um but they were yiddish speakers by the

3446
01:51:54,079 --> 01:51:56,800
time you know i met them by the time

3447
01:51:55,439 --> 01:51:57,919
they had gone through germany and come

3448
01:51:56,800 --> 01:51:58,880
to the united states or really gone

3449
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:00,000
through poland and come the united

3450
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:01,279
states they were yiddish speakers so

3451
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:02,319
there's no one really in my family who

3452
01:52:01,279 --> 01:52:04,000
speaks russian

3453
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:05,920
but i do feel a connection there at

3454
01:52:04,000 --> 01:52:07,760
least a long range

3455
01:52:05,920 --> 01:52:09,599
personal connection is there something

3456
01:52:07,760 --> 01:52:12,880
to be said about the language

3457
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:15,520
and your ability to imagine history

3458
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:17,118
sort of when you study these different

3459
01:52:15,520 --> 01:52:19,360
countries

3460
01:52:17,118 --> 01:52:20,799
your ability to imagine what it was like

3461
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:23,519
to be

3462
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:24,560
um a part of that culture part of that

3463
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,880
time

3464
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:28,480
yes language is crucial to understanding

3465
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:30,560
a culture and

3466
01:52:28,479 --> 01:52:32,319
even if you learn the language as i have

3467
01:52:30,560 --> 01:52:33,520
learning russian and german and french

3468
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:35,519
it's still not the same as also being a

3469
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:38,239
native speaker either as you know

3470
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:39,280
um but i think language tells you a lot

3471
01:52:38,238 --> 01:52:43,198
about mannerism

3472
01:52:39,279 --> 01:52:46,639
about assumptions uh the very fact that

3473
01:52:43,198 --> 01:52:49,279
english doesn't have a formal you

3474
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:49,920
but russian has a formally right versus

3475
01:52:49,279 --> 01:52:53,039
right

3476
01:52:49,920 --> 01:52:55,199
german has a formal you z versus d right

3477
01:52:53,039 --> 01:52:56,238
so the fact that english doesn't have a

3478
01:52:55,198 --> 01:52:58,879
formal you

3479
01:52:56,238 --> 01:53:00,238
tells you something uh about americans

3480
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:03,440
right that's just one example

3481
01:53:00,238 --> 01:53:07,198
uh the fact that um you know that

3482
01:53:03,439 --> 01:53:09,759
germans have such a wider vocabulary

3483
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:11,118
for certain scientific concepts than we

3484
01:53:09,760 --> 01:53:13,119
have in english tells you something

3485
01:53:11,118 --> 01:53:15,039
about the culture right language

3486
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:16,319
is an artifact of the culture the

3487
01:53:15,039 --> 01:53:17,840
culture makes the language

3488
01:53:16,319 --> 01:53:21,359
it's fascinating to explore i mean even

3489
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:21,360
just exactly what you just said

3490
01:53:22,158 --> 01:53:26,559
which is there's a fascinating

3491
01:53:25,118 --> 01:53:28,479
transition

3492
01:53:26,560 --> 01:53:30,000
so i guess in english we just have you

3493
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:32,718
yeah

3494
01:53:30,000 --> 01:53:34,719
there's a there's a fascinating

3495
01:53:32,719 --> 01:53:38,000
transition that persists to this day

3496
01:53:34,719 --> 01:53:40,719
is is of formalism and politeness

3497
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,238
where it's an initial kind of dance of

3498
01:53:40,719 --> 01:53:45,279
interaction that's

3499
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:48,959
uh different methods

3500
01:53:45,279 --> 01:53:50,800
of signaling respect i guess we don't

3501
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:53,118
then language provides that and in the

3502
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:54,880
united in the english language

3503
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:56,158
there's fewer tools to show that kind of

3504
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,920
respect which has

3505
01:53:56,158 --> 01:54:00,319
potentially positive or negative effects

3506
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:02,480
and it flattens the society where like a

3507
01:54:00,319 --> 01:54:06,079
teenager could talk to an older person

3508
01:54:02,479 --> 01:54:09,039
and show like uh like a difference

3509
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:11,039
i mean but at the same time i mean it

3510
01:54:09,039 --> 01:54:12,639
creates a certain kind of dynamic a

3511
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:14,399
certain kind of society

3512
01:54:12,639 --> 01:54:16,079
and it's funny to think of just like

3513
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:18,079
those few words can have any

3514
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:19,760
like a ripple effect through the whole

3515
01:54:18,079 --> 01:54:20,639
culture and we don't have a history in

3516
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:23,679
the united states of

3517
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:25,679
of aristocracy yeah the these uh

3518
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:26,719
elements of language reflect aristocracy

3519
01:54:25,679 --> 01:54:28,480
the the the surf

3520
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:30,158
would never refer to the master even if

3521
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:32,479
the master is younger

3522
01:54:30,158 --> 01:54:33,679
it's always void right of it's always

3523
01:54:32,479 --> 01:54:36,238
right i mean and so

3524
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:37,520
it's um yeah so it tells you something

3525
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:39,039
about the history that's why to your

3526
01:54:37,520 --> 01:54:40,239
question which was a great question it's

3527
01:54:39,039 --> 01:54:42,000
so crucial

3528
01:54:40,238 --> 01:54:43,359
to try to penetrate the language i'll

3529
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:44,880
also say something else

3530
01:54:43,359 --> 01:54:46,000
and this is a problem for many americans

3531
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:47,359
who haven't learned a foreign language

3532
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:48,158
we're very bad at teaching foreign

3533
01:54:47,359 --> 01:54:50,158
languages

3534
01:54:48,158 --> 01:54:51,598
if you've never taught yourself a

3535
01:54:50,158 --> 01:54:53,439
foreign language

3536
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:54,960
you have closed yourself off to certain

3537
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:56,960
kinds of empathy

3538
01:54:54,960 --> 01:54:59,520
because you have basically trained your

3539
01:54:56,960 --> 01:55:01,118
brain to only look at the world one way

3540
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:04,480
the very act of learning another

3541
01:55:01,118 --> 01:55:07,279
language i think tells your brain

3542
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:08,000
that words and concepts don't translate

3543
01:55:07,279 --> 01:55:09,118
one to one

3544
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:10,880
this is the first thing you realize

3545
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:12,158
right we can say you know these two

3546
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:14,159
words mean the same thing from two

3547
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:15,279
languages they never mean exactly

3548
01:55:14,158 --> 01:55:17,359
yeah it's the same thing right dos

3549
01:55:15,279 --> 01:55:20,719
fedonia is really not goodbye

3550
01:55:17,359 --> 01:55:22,319
yes right and there's something you know

3551
01:55:20,719 --> 01:55:24,319
right now there's people talking about

3552
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:26,399
idea of lived experience

3553
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:27,679
one of the ways to force yourself into

3554
01:55:26,399 --> 01:55:29,198
this idea

3555
01:55:27,679 --> 01:55:31,039
of liv's experience is by learning

3556
01:55:29,198 --> 01:55:32,719
another language is to understand that

3557
01:55:31,039 --> 01:55:34,319
you can perceive the world in a totally

3558
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:35,760
different way even even though you're

3559
01:55:34,319 --> 01:55:37,840
perceiving the same thing

3560
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:39,119
and of course the way to first learn

3561
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:41,279
russian for those

3562
01:55:39,118 --> 01:55:42,399
looking for tutorial lessons for me is

3563
01:55:41,279 --> 01:55:44,880
just like as you said

3564
01:55:42,399 --> 01:55:46,399
you start by drinking lots of vodka yes

3565
01:55:44,880 --> 01:55:49,279
of course it's very difficult

3566
01:55:46,399 --> 01:55:50,479
to do otherwise is there advice you have

3567
01:55:49,279 --> 01:55:54,559
for young people

3568
01:55:50,479 --> 01:55:57,839
about career about life uh

3569
01:55:54,560 --> 01:56:00,480
in making their way in the world yes

3570
01:55:57,840 --> 01:56:02,719
the two things i i believe that i say to

3571
01:56:00,479 --> 01:56:05,839
a lot of talented young people first

3572
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:07,920
um i i don't think you can predict

3573
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:08,880
what is going to be well renumerated 20

3574
01:56:07,920 --> 01:56:10,399
years from now

3575
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,000
don't pick a profession because you

3576
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:12,960
think even though your parents might

3577
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:14,158
tell you or

3578
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:16,079
do this and you'll make money you know

3579
01:56:14,158 --> 01:56:16,479
this is the scene in the graduate uh

3580
01:56:16,079 --> 01:56:18,000
where

3581
01:56:16,479 --> 01:56:20,158
a guy tells dustin hoffman going to

3582
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:21,760
plastics money and plastics

3583
01:56:20,158 --> 01:56:23,598
we don't know so many of my students now

3584
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:25,840
have parents who are telling them

3585
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:26,880
uh bright students you know go to the

3586
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:28,079
business school that's

3587
01:56:26,880 --> 01:56:29,920
that's what's going to set you up to

3588
01:56:28,079 --> 01:56:30,960
make money if you're passionate about

3589
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:33,440
business yes

3590
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:35,359
but don't begin by thinking you know

3591
01:56:33,439 --> 01:56:36,638
what's going to be hot 20 years from now

3592
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:38,399
you don't know what's going to be hot

3593
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:38,719
from 20 years ago about 20 years from

3594
01:56:38,399 --> 01:56:40,238
now

3595
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:42,880
what should you do this is advice number

3596
01:56:40,238 --> 01:56:45,039
one find what you're passionate about

3597
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:46,719
because if you're passionate about it

3598
01:56:45,039 --> 01:56:47,519
you will do good work in that area or if

3599
01:56:46,719 --> 01:56:50,079
you're talented

3600
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:51,360
and usually passion and talent overlap

3601
01:56:50,079 --> 01:56:52,639
and you'll find a way to get people to

3602
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:54,158
pay you for it

3603
01:56:52,639 --> 01:56:55,679
i mean you do it really well people will

3604
01:56:54,158 --> 01:56:56,079
want to pay that that's where capitalism

3605
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:57,760
works

3606
01:56:56,079 --> 01:56:59,599
people will find it valuable right

3607
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:02,000
whether it's violin playing

3608
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:03,279
right or engineering or poetry you will

3609
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:05,039
find you might not become a

3610
01:57:03,279 --> 01:57:06,399
billionaire that involves other things

3611
01:57:05,039 --> 01:57:07,279
but you'll find a way to get people to

3612
01:57:06,399 --> 01:57:10,319
pay you for it

3613
01:57:07,279 --> 01:57:11,439
and then the second thing is um it's

3614
01:57:10,319 --> 01:57:13,359
really important

3615
01:57:11,439 --> 01:57:14,719
uh at the very beginning of your career

3616
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:17,439
even before you're in

3617
01:57:14,719 --> 01:57:18,158
your job right to start building your

3618
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:20,799
networks

3619
01:57:18,158 --> 01:57:21,198
but networks are not just people you're

3620
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:23,039
on

3621
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:24,559
facebook with or twitter with i mean

3622
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:26,719
that's fine uh

3623
01:57:24,560 --> 01:57:28,080
it's actually forming relationships and

3624
01:57:26,719 --> 01:57:29,198
some of that can be mediated in the

3625
01:57:28,079 --> 01:57:30,238
digital world but i mean real

3626
01:57:29,198 --> 01:57:32,079
relationships

3627
01:57:30,238 --> 01:57:34,079
i like podcasts because i think they

3628
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:36,158
actually open up that space i know a lot

3629
01:57:34,079 --> 01:57:37,679
of people can listen to a podcast

3630
01:57:36,158 --> 01:57:39,679
and find someone else who's listened to

3631
01:57:37,679 --> 01:57:42,158
that podcast and have a conversation

3632
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:44,158
about a topic it opens up that space

3633
01:57:42,158 --> 01:57:45,679
build those relationships not with

3634
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:46,719
people who you think will be powerful

3635
01:57:45,679 --> 01:57:48,880
but people you think

3636
01:57:46,719 --> 01:57:50,319
are interesting because they'll do

3637
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:53,920
interesting things

3638
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:55,679
and every successful person i know

3639
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:57,359
at some level had a key moment where

3640
01:57:55,679 --> 01:57:58,639
they got where they are

3641
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:00,479
because of someone they knew for some

3642
01:57:58,639 --> 01:58:01,118
other reason yeah who had that

3643
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:03,919
connection

3644
01:58:01,118 --> 01:58:05,679
so use and spread your networks and make

3645
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:06,399
them as diverse as possible find people

3646
01:58:05,679 --> 01:58:08,480
who

3647
01:58:06,399 --> 01:58:11,598
are of a different party have different

3648
01:58:08,479 --> 01:58:13,359
interests but are interesting to you

3649
01:58:11,599 --> 01:58:15,039
that's brilliant advice and some of the

3650
01:58:13,359 --> 01:58:18,639
on the on the passion side

3651
01:58:15,039 --> 01:58:21,198
i do find that um as somebody who has a

3652
01:58:18,639 --> 01:58:25,599
lot of passions

3653
01:58:21,198 --> 01:58:28,399
i i find the the second part to that

3654
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:29,279
is commit committing yes that's true

3655
01:58:28,399 --> 01:58:32,559
which sucks

3656
01:58:29,279 --> 01:58:33,519
because life is finite and when you

3657
01:58:32,560 --> 01:58:37,840
commit

3658
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:39,840
you say well i'm never going to be good

3659
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:41,199
like when you choose one of your two

3660
01:58:39,840 --> 01:58:42,239
passions one of the two things you're

3661
01:58:41,198 --> 01:58:44,879
interested in

3662
01:58:42,238 --> 01:58:45,759
you're basically saying i'm i'm letting

3663
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:48,960
go i'm saying

3664
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:50,079
this to that's true that's true which is

3665
01:58:48,960 --> 01:58:51,840
actually what does it down your means

3666
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:53,519
nice five letting go that's exactly

3667
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,800
right yeah i think that's exactly right

3668
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:56,800
i think that's i think you do have to

3669
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:58,480
make choices you have to set priorities

3670
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:00,320
i often laugh at students who tell me

3671
01:58:58,479 --> 01:59:01,439
they want to have like three majors

3672
01:59:00,319 --> 01:59:03,599
if you have three majors you have no

3673
01:59:01,439 --> 01:59:05,519
major right i mean so i do think you

3674
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:09,760
have to make choices i also think

3675
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:12,400
um it's important that whatever you do

3676
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:14,320
even if it's a small thing you do you

3677
01:59:12,399 --> 01:59:15,359
always do the best you can you always do

3678
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:17,039
excellent work

3679
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:19,359
my kids are tired of hearing me say this

3680
01:59:17,039 --> 01:59:21,840
at home but i believe everything you do

3681
01:59:19,359 --> 01:59:22,399
should be about excellence the best you

3682
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:23,520
can do

3683
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:24,879
if i'm going to wash the dishes i'm

3684
01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:25,760
going to be the best person washing the

3685
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:27,359
dishes yeah

3686
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:28,639
right if i'm going to write a book

3687
01:59:27,359 --> 01:59:29,118
review i'm going to make the best

3688
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:31,199
possible

3689
01:59:29,118 --> 01:59:32,319
book review i can why because you

3690
01:59:31,198 --> 01:59:34,399
develop a culture

3691
01:59:32,319 --> 01:59:36,238
among about yourself which is about

3692
01:59:34,399 --> 01:59:38,319
excellence yeah i was

3693
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:40,000

unbearable

3702
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:57,760
there's so much joy for me i think for

3703
01:59:56,158 --> 01:59:58,399
everyone but okay let me just speak for

3704
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:01,599
me

3705
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:03,598
to be discovered in getting really good

3706
02:00:01,599 --> 02:00:06,400
at anything in fact getting good at

3707
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:10,639
stuff that most people believe

3708
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:13,920
is boring or menial labor or

3709
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:16,400
uh you know impossible to be interesting

3710
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:17,679
that's even more joyful to find the joy

3711
02:00:16,399 --> 02:00:19,839
within that in the excellent

3712
02:00:17,679 --> 02:00:21,359
it's the giro dreams of sushi making the

3713
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:22,960
same freaking

3714
02:00:21,359 --> 02:00:25,039
sushi over and over and becoming a

3715
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:26,960
master that that's that can be truly

3716
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:29,599
joyful there's a sense of pride

3717
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,239
and on the pragmatic level you never

3718
02:00:29,599 --> 02:00:32,400
know when

3719
02:00:30,238 --> 02:00:33,279
someone will spot that and uh

3720
02:00:32,399 --> 02:00:35,359
intelligent

3721
02:00:33,279 --> 02:00:36,880
people who perform at the level of high

3722
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:39,118
excellence look for others

3723
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:41,039
yeah and it radiates some kind of signal

3724
02:00:39,118 --> 02:00:42,639
it's weird it wears what you're

3725
02:00:41,039 --> 02:00:45,840
it's weird what you're attracting

3726
02:00:42,639 --> 02:00:48,400
yourself when you just focus on mastery

3727
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,039
and pursuing excellence in something

3728
02:00:48,399 --> 02:00:51,679
like

3729
02:00:49,039 --> 02:00:52,719
this is the cool thing uh about it

3730
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:54,158
that's the joy i've

3731
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:55,760
really truly experienced i didn't have

3732
02:00:54,158 --> 02:00:56,559
to do much work it's just cool people

3733
02:00:55,760 --> 02:00:58,719
kind of

3734
02:00:56,560 --> 02:01:00,639
i find myself in groups of cool people

3735
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:02,399
like really people who are excited about

3736
02:01:00,639 --> 02:01:05,118
life who are passionate about life

3737
02:01:02,399 --> 02:01:06,479
there's a fire in their eyes that's uh

3738
02:01:05,118 --> 02:01:06,880
you know at the end of the day just

3739
02:01:06,479 --> 02:01:09,279
makes

3740
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:10,800
life fun you know something and then

3741
02:01:09,279 --> 02:01:12,960
also money-wise

3742
02:01:10,800 --> 02:01:14,960
at least in this society we're fortunate

3743
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:16,960
to where if you do that kind of thing

3744
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:19,279
money will find a way like i have the

3745
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:21,439
great i say this that don't care about

3746
02:01:19,279 --> 02:01:22,880
money

3747
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:24,799
you know i have to think about what that

3748
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:25,760
means because some people criticize that

3749
02:01:24,800 --> 02:01:28,639
idea as like yeah

3750
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:28,880
that must be nice to say that uh because

3751
02:01:28,639 --> 02:01:30,880
i

3752
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:32,079
have for much many periods of my life

3753
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:35,118
had very little money

3754
02:01:32,079 --> 02:01:37,359
but i think we live in a society where

3755
02:01:35,118 --> 02:01:38,880
not caring about money but just focusing

3756
02:01:37,359 --> 02:01:40,719
on your passions

3757
02:01:38,880 --> 02:01:42,319
if you're truly pursuing excellence

3758
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:43,679
whatever that is money will find you

3759
02:01:42,319 --> 02:01:44,639
that's i guess the ideal of the

3760
02:01:43,679 --> 02:01:46,319
capitalist system

3761
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:47,679
and i think that the entrepreneurs i've

3762
02:01:46,319 --> 02:01:48,079
studied and had the chance to get to

3763
02:01:47,679 --> 02:01:50,000
know

3764
02:01:48,079 --> 02:01:51,198
and i'm sure you'd agree with this they

3765
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:52,479
they do what they do because they're

3766
02:01:51,198 --> 02:01:54,479
passionate about the product

3767
02:01:52,479 --> 02:01:56,638
yeah they're not just in it to make

3768
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:57,039
money in fact that's when they get into

3769
02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:00,639
trouble

3770
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:02,639
yeah just trying to make money exactly

3771
02:02:00,639 --> 02:02:04,239
you said your grandmother emily had a

3772
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:08,159
big impact on your life

3773
02:02:04,238 --> 02:02:11,439
she lived to 102

3774
02:02:08,158 --> 02:02:13,279
what are some lessons she taught you

3775
02:02:11,439 --> 02:02:14,559
emily who was the the child of

3776
02:02:13,279 --> 02:02:16,840
immigrants from from

3777
02:02:14,560 --> 02:02:18,159
russia and poland who never went to

3778
02:02:16,840 --> 02:02:20,480
college

3779
02:02:18,158 --> 02:02:21,359
her proudest day i think was when when i

3780
02:02:20,479 --> 02:02:24,718
went to college

3781
02:02:21,359 --> 02:02:27,519
um she

3782
02:02:24,719 --> 02:02:28,800
she treated everyone with respect and

3783
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:30,080
tried to get to know everyone she knew

3784
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,599
every bus driver

3785
02:02:30,079 --> 02:02:33,279
in the town she'd remember their

3786
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:35,199
birthdays

3787
02:02:33,279 --> 02:02:37,840
and one of the things she taught me is

3788
02:02:35,198 --> 02:02:39,839
no matter how high you fly

3789
02:02:37,840 --> 02:02:41,599
the lowest person close to the ground

3790
02:02:39,840 --> 02:02:43,920
matters to you

3791
02:02:41,599 --> 02:02:44,800
and uh you treat them the same way you

3792
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:47,199
treat the

3793
02:02:44,800 --> 02:02:48,560
billionaire at the top of the podium and

3794
02:02:47,198 --> 02:02:49,439
she she did that she didn't just say

3795
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:51,280
that

3796
02:02:49,439 --> 02:02:53,839
some people say then don't do it she she

3797
02:02:51,279 --> 02:02:56,719
really did that and i always

3798
02:02:53,840 --> 02:02:58,480
remember that it comes up in my mind at

3799
02:02:56,719 --> 02:03:01,599
least once a week because

3800
02:02:58,479 --> 02:03:03,359
we're all busy doing a lot of things and

3801
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:04,000
you either see or you even feel in

3802
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:05,920
yourself

3803
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,039
the desire to just for the reasons of

3804
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:09,920
speed

3805
02:03:07,039 --> 02:03:11,840
to be short or not polite with someone

3806
02:03:09,920 --> 02:03:13,199
who can't do anything to harm you right

3807
02:03:11,840 --> 02:03:15,599
now

3808
02:03:13,198 --> 02:03:16,638
and i remember uh her saying to me no

3809
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:18,480
you you don't

3810
02:03:16,639 --> 02:03:20,159
you you you treat everyone with respect

3811
02:03:18,479 --> 02:03:22,319
you treat you know the person you're on

3812
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:23,598
the phone with right customer service

3813
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:25,359
you treat that person if you're talking

3814
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:28,719
to jeff bezos so you're talking to

3815
02:03:25,359 --> 02:03:30,238
elon musk right uh and and i think

3816
02:03:28,719 --> 02:03:32,319
making that a culture of who you are is

3817
02:03:30,238 --> 02:03:33,359
so important and people notice that

3818
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:34,719
that's the other thing

3819
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:36,000
and they notice when it's authentic

3820
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:36,719
everyone's nice to the person at the

3821
02:03:36,000 --> 02:03:38,158
bottom of the

3822
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:39,920
totem pole when you want to get a head

3823
02:03:38,158 --> 02:03:41,359
in the line for your driver's license

3824
02:03:39,920 --> 02:03:43,118
yeah but are you nice to them when you

3825
02:03:41,359 --> 02:03:45,439
don't need that they notice that

3826
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:47,039
and even when nobody's watching that has

3827
02:03:45,439 --> 02:03:50,158
a weird effect on you

3828
02:03:47,039 --> 02:03:51,760
that's going to uh have a ripple effect

3829
02:03:50,158 --> 02:03:52,559
and people know that's the cool thing

3830
02:03:51,760 --> 02:03:54,480
about the internet

3831
02:03:52,560 --> 02:03:55,760
i've come to believe that people see

3832
02:03:54,479 --> 02:03:57,359
authenticity they see

3833
02:03:55,760 --> 02:03:58,960
when you're full of [ __ ] when you're not

3834
02:03:57,359 --> 02:04:00,319
that's right the other thing that that

3835
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,760
emily taught me and i think we've all

3836
02:04:00,319 --> 02:04:02,799
had relatives who have taught us this

3837
02:04:01,760 --> 02:04:04,400
right that you could

3838
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:05,760
be very uneducated she was very

3839
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:06,719
uneducated she you know she had a high

3840
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:09,199
school diploma

3841
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:10,960
but i think she was working in you know

3842
02:04:09,198 --> 02:04:12,238
in a delicatessen in new york you know

3843
02:04:10,960 --> 02:04:12,560
while she was in high school or maybe it

3844
02:04:12,238 --> 02:04:14,000
was

3845
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:15,039
gimbals or something so she didn't take

3846
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:15,840
high school very seriously she wasn't

3847
02:04:15,039 --> 02:04:18,639
very well educated

3848
02:04:15,840 --> 02:04:19,599
she was very smart and we can fall into

3849
02:04:18,639 --> 02:04:21,279
a world

3850
02:04:19,599 --> 02:04:23,360
where i'm a big believer in higher

3851
02:04:21,279 --> 02:04:24,158
education and getting a phd and things

3852
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:25,279
of that sort

3853
02:04:24,158 --> 02:04:27,920
but where we think those are the only

3854
02:04:25,279 --> 02:04:27,920
smart people

3855
02:04:29,118 --> 02:04:32,719
sometimes those are the people because

3856
02:04:31,359 --> 02:04:33,679
of their accomplishments because their

3857
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:37,679
egos are the ones

3858
02:04:33,679 --> 02:04:40,158
who are least educated

3859
02:04:37,679 --> 02:04:40,800
in the way of the world yeah least

3860
02:04:40,158 --> 02:04:43,439
curious

3861
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,719
and now ultimately wisdom comes from

3862
02:04:43,439 --> 02:04:46,719
curiosity

3863
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:47,920
and sometimes getting a phd can get away

3864
02:04:46,719 --> 02:04:50,000
uh it can get

3865
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:53,840
in the way of curiosity as opposed to

3866
02:04:50,000 --> 02:04:53,840
empower curiosity

3867
02:04:54,158 --> 02:04:58,158
let me ask uh from a historical

3868
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:01,519
perspective

3869
02:04:58,158 --> 02:05:03,279
you've studied some of human history so

3870
02:05:01,520 --> 02:05:07,040
maybe you have an insight about what's

3871
02:05:03,279 --> 02:05:09,039
the meaning of life

3872
02:05:07,039 --> 02:05:10,158
why do you ever ask when you look at

3873
02:05:09,039 --> 02:05:12,000
history the why

3874
02:05:10,158 --> 02:05:13,598
yeah i do all the time and i don't have

3875
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,760
i don't have a i don't have an answer

3876
02:05:13,599 --> 02:05:19,360
it's it's the mystery that we can't uh

3877
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:20,000
answer i i do think um what it means is

3878
02:05:19,359 --> 02:05:23,118
what we make of

3879
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:25,039
it there's no universal

3880
02:05:23,118 --> 02:05:26,319
every every period i've studied and i've

3881
02:05:25,039 --> 02:05:27,840
studied a little bit of a lot of periods

3882
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:29,279
and a lot of a few periods

3883
02:05:27,840 --> 02:05:31,039
every period people struggle with this

3884
02:05:29,279 --> 02:05:33,759
and there's no they don't come to

3885
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:34,479
wiser people than us don't come to a

3886
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:37,360
firm answer

3887
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:38,799
except it's what you make of it meaning

3888
02:05:37,359 --> 02:05:41,759
is what you make of it so

3889
02:05:38,800 --> 02:05:43,039
think about what what you want to care

3890
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,280
about and make that

3891
02:05:43,039 --> 02:05:48,000
the meaning in your life um i wonder how

3892
02:05:45,279 --> 02:05:50,800
that changes throughout human history

3893
02:05:48,000 --> 02:05:51,439
whether there's a constant like that's i

3894
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:53,920
often

3895
02:05:51,439 --> 02:05:55,919
think especially when you study

3896
02:05:53,920 --> 02:05:57,840
evolutionary biology and you just

3897
02:05:55,920 --> 02:05:59,118
see our origins from life and as it

3898
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:02,159
evolves

3899
02:05:59,118 --> 02:06:04,319
it's like it makes you wonder if

3900
02:06:02,158 --> 02:06:06,799
it feels like there's a thread that

3901
02:06:04,319 --> 02:06:10,960
connects all of it

3902
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:15,360
that we're headed somewhere

3903
02:06:10,960 --> 02:06:18,399
we're trying to actualize some greater

3904
02:06:15,359 --> 02:06:20,158
purpose you know like there there seems

3905
02:06:18,399 --> 02:06:21,598
to be a direction to this thing

3906
02:06:20,158 --> 02:06:23,920
and we're all kind of stumbling in the

3907
02:06:21,599 --> 02:06:26,159
dark trying to figure it out

3908
02:06:23,920 --> 02:06:28,239
but it feels like we eventually will

3909
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:30,719
find an answer

3910
02:06:28,238 --> 02:06:31,279
i hope so yeah maybe i mean i do think

3911
02:06:30,719 --> 02:06:34,800
we all

3912
02:06:31,279 --> 02:06:38,158
um we all want

3913
02:06:34,800 --> 02:06:38,960
our families to do better we are we we

3914
02:06:38,158 --> 02:06:40,399
are

3915
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:42,000
familiar and family doesn't just mean

3916
02:06:40,399 --> 02:06:44,158
biological family you can have all kinds

3917
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:47,599
of ways you define family and community

3918
02:06:44,158 --> 02:06:48,000
and i think i think we are moving slowly

3919
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:51,039
and

3920
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:53,760
in a very messy way toward a larger

3921
02:06:51,039 --> 02:06:54,800
world community to include all of

3922
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:58,000
biological life

3923
02:06:54,800 --> 02:07:01,840
and eventually uh artificial life

3924
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:05,599
as well and so that this

3925
02:07:01,840 --> 02:07:08,159
to uh to expand the lesson to the advice

3926
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:09,199
that uh your grandmother taught you is i

3927
02:07:08,158 --> 02:07:12,638
think we should treat

3928
02:07:09,198 --> 02:07:14,399
robots and ai systems uh good

3929
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:15,760
as well even if they're currently not

3930
02:07:14,399 --> 02:07:17,359
very intelligent because

3931
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:18,960
one day they might be right right i

3932
02:07:17,359 --> 02:07:20,719
think that's exactly right and and we

3933
02:07:18,960 --> 02:07:23,118
should think through

3934
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:24,399
exactly exactly as a humanist how i

3935
02:07:23,118 --> 02:07:26,799
would approach that issue

3936
02:07:24,399 --> 02:07:29,118
we need to think through the kinds of

3937
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:31,920
behavior patterns we want to establish

3938
02:07:29,118 --> 02:07:32,719
with these new forms of life artificial

3939
02:07:31,920 --> 02:07:35,920
life

3940
02:07:32,719 --> 02:07:37,359
um for ourselves also to your point so

3941
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:39,840
we behave the right way so we don't

3942
02:07:37,359 --> 02:07:42,238
misuse this

3943
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:44,480
started talking about abraham lincoln

3944
02:07:42,238 --> 02:07:46,559
ended talking about robots

3945
02:07:44,479 --> 02:07:48,799
i think this is the perfect conversation

3946
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:52,239

roosevelt fdr democracy cannot succeed

3966
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,840
unless those who express their choice

3967
02:08:28,960 --> 02:08:32,399
are prepared

3968
02:08:29,840 --> 02:08:33,920
to choose wisely the real safeguard of

3969
02:08:32,399 --> 02:08:36,879
democracy therefore

3970
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:37,920
