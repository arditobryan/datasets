1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,679
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,960
clara souza silva a quantum master

3
00:00:03,678 --> 00:00:07,599
chemist at harvard

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,320
specializing in spectroscopy of gases

5
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,279
that serve as

6
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,480
possible signs of life on other planets

7
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,678
most especially

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,399
the gas phosphine she was a co-author of

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,278
the paper

10
00:00:16,399 --> 00:00:21,358
that in 2020 found that there is

11
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:24,559
phosphine in the atmosphere of venus

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,199
and thus possible extraterrestrial life

13
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:27,439
that lives

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,880
in its atmosphere the detection of

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,439
phosphene was challenged

16
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,558
reaffirmed and is now still under active

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,960
research

18
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,839
quick mention of our sponsors onnit

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,640
grammarly

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,360
blinkist and indeed check them out in

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,920
the description

22
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:43,679
to support this podcast as a side note

23
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,000
let me say that i think the search for

24
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,840
life

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
on other planets is one of the most

26
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,680
important endeavors in science

27
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,280
if we find extraterrestrial life and

28
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:53,359
study it we may find

29
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,439
insights into the mechanisms that

30
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,439
originated at life here on earth

31
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,198
and more than life the mechanisms that

32
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,439
originated intelligence

33
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:02,399
and consciousness if we understand these

34
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,280
mechanisms

35
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,280
we can build them but more than this the

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,000
discovery of life on other planets

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,680
means that our galaxy and our universe

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,079
is teeming with life

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,799
this is humbling and terrifying but it

40
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:17,679
is also

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:19,439
exciting we humans and natural explorers

42
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,560
for most our history we explored the

43
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,438
surface of the earth

44
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
and the contents of our minds but now

45
00:01:23,438 --> 00:01:26,959
with space-faring vessels

46
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
we have a chance to explore life beyond

47
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:31,519
earth their physics

48
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:33,039
their biology and perhaps the contents

49
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:35,438
of their minds

50
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,960
this is the lex friedman podcast and

51
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:40,478
here is my conversation

52
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:43,759
with clara souza since you're

53
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,759
the world expert in uh well in many

54
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,478
things but one of them is phosphine

55
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,599
would it technically be correct to call

56
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,719
you the

57
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,879
queen of phosphine

58
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:56,078
i go for dr faustine queen is an

59
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,280
inherited title

60
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:02,559
i feel but you still uh rule by

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,439
um love and power so

62
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,240
while having the doctor title kindness

63
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:09,919
kindness

64
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:11,840
kindness in september 2020

65
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,598
you co-authored a paper announcing

66
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,280
possible presence of phosphine in the

67
00:02:13,598 --> 00:02:19,000
atmosphere of venus

68
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,080
and uh that it may be a signature of

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,800
extraterrestrial life big maybe big

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,080
maybe

71
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,599
there was some pushback of course

72
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,680
from the scientific community that

73
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:34,000
followed friendly loving pushback

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
then in january another paper from

75
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,360
university wisconsin i believe confirmed

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,400
the finding

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,720
so where do we stand in this saga

78
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,840
in this mystery of what the heck is

79
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:45,919
going on

80
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,239
on venus in terms of phosphine in terms

81
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,719
of aliens

82
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,920
okay let's try to break it down okay the

83
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:55,280
short answer is

84
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,878
we don't know um i think you

85
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,959
and the rest of the public are now

86
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,518
witnessing a pretty exciting discovery

87
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,640
but

88
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,560
as it evolves as it unfolds

89
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:10,318
um we did not wait until we had

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,199
you know years of data from 10 different

91
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,518
instruments across several layers the

92
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,799
atmosphere we waited until we had

93
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:22,319
two telescopes with independent data

94
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,200
months apart but still the data is

95
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:26,318
weak it's noisy it's delicate it's very

96
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,280
much at the edge

97
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,560
of instrument sensibility sensitivity

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,000
and so

99
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
we still don't even know if it is

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,680
phosphine we don't even

101
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,360
really know if the signal is real people

102
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,000
still disagree about that

103
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,080
and i think it at the most more

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,799
philosophical end of how this happened

105
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,000
i think it is a distinction and myself

106
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,560
and other co-authors were talking

107
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,598
about this it's a distinction between

108
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,360
hypotheses

109
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:56,238
generation and hypothesis testing now

110
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,720
hypothesis testing is something that i

111
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,200
think is the backbone of

112
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:02,878
you know the scientific method but it

113
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,079
has a problem which is

114
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,318
if you're looking through very noisy

115
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,799
data and you want to test the hypotheses

116
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,798
you may by mistake create a spurious

117
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:13,120
signal

118
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
the safest more conservative approach is

119
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,798
hypothesis generation

120
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,798
you see some data and you go what's in

121
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,078
there with no bias

122
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,839
now this is much safer much more

123
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,560
conservative and when there's a lot of

124
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,959
data

125
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,839
that's great when there isn't you can

126
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,478
clean the noise

127
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:29,279
and take out the signal with it the

128
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,120
signal with the

129
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,119
bath water whatever the equivalent of

130
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,280
the analogy would be

131
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,199
and so i think the healthy discourse

132
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,439
that you described is exactly this

133
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,040
there are ways of processing the data

134
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,800
completely legitimate ways checked by

135
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:45,120
multiple people and experts

136
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,600
where the signal shows up and then

137
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,439
phosphene is in the atmosphere of venus

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,240
and some where it doesn't and then we

139
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:55,360
disagree what that signal means

140
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,400
if it's real and it is an ambiguously

141
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,319
phosphine

142
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:59,599
it is very exciting because we don't

143
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,879
know how to explain it

144
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,919
without life but going from there to

145
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,038
the nutrients is still a huge jump and

146
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:08,959
so

147
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,719
so that would be the the title for the

148
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:12,959
civilization if it is

149
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,160
a living and thriving and venus is

150
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,079
venusians

151
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
until we know what they call themselves

152
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:21,038
and that that's the name yes

153
00:05:18,399 --> 00:05:21,599
so this is the early analysis of data or

154
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,879
a data

155
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,680
analysis of early data

156
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:29,600
it was nevertheless you waited until the

157
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,519
actual peer-reviewed publication

158
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,280
of course and analysis of the two

159
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,680
different instruments months apart so

160
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:36,719
that's

161
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,560
alma and jcmt the two telescopes

162
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,400
and it's still i mean it's really

163
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,319
exciting what what did it feel like sort

164
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,560
of sitting on this data

165
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,879
like kind of anticipating the

166
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,319
publication and wondering

167
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,879
and still wondering is it um is it true

168
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,439
like

169
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,439
how does it make you feel that a planet

170
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:56,719
in our solar system might have phosphine

171
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,800
in the atmosphere

172
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,800
it's nuts it's absolutely nuts

173
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,038
i mean in the best possible way

174
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:08,879
i've been working on phosphine for over

175
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,199
a decade

176
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,159
before it was cool way before it was

177
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,160
cool

178
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,000
um before anyone could spell it or heard

179
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,600
of it and

180
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,680
at the time people either didn't know

181
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,560
what phosphine was or only knew it

182
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,240
for being just possibly the most

183
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,079
horrendous molecule that

184
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,199
ever graced the earth and so

185
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,279
no one was a fan um and i'd been

186
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,360
considering looking for it because i did

187
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,799
think it was an unusual and disgusting

188
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,639
but very promising sound

189
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,000
sign of life i've been looking for it

190
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,280
everywhere

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,160
i really didn't think to look in the

192
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:47,119
solar system i

193
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,840
thought it was all pretty rough around

194
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,240
here

195
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,519
for for life and so i wasn't even

196
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,960
considering

197
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,198
the solar system at all never mind next

198
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,439
door venus it was only the lead author

199
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,360
of the study jane greaves who

200
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:01,038
thought to look in the clouds of venus

201
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,919
and then reached out to me

202
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,800
to say i don't know phosphene but i know

203
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,918
it's weird

204
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,879
um how weird is it and the answer is

205
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:10,719
very weird

206
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,038
and so the telescopes were looking at

207
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,880
this is visual data

208
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,079
what do you mean by visual you wouldn't

209
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:18,800
see the phosphene well

210
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,598
but i mean it's uh well it's a telescope

211
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,038
it's remote

212
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,639
it's remote you're observing

213
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,639
you're what's zooming in on this

214
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,720
particular planet i mean what what

215
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
what does the sensor actually look like

216
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,840
how many pixels are

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,399
there what does the data kind of look

218
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:38,000
like it'd be nice to kind of

219
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,638
build up intuition of how little data we

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,879
have

221
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,759
based on which i mean if you look at

222
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:43,360
like

223
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,038
i've just been reading a lot about

224
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,240
gravitational waves and it's kind of

225
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,519
incredible

226
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,280
how from just very little like probably

227
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:54,159
the world's most precise

228
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,079
uh instrument we can derive some very

229
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,280
foundational ideas about our early

230
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,959
universe

231
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:00,638
and in that same way it's kind of

232
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:02,239
incredible how much data how much

233
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,038
information you can get from just a few

234
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,759
pixels

235
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,519
so what are we talking about here in

236
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,960
terms of

237
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:11,519
based on which this paper saw possible

238
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:13,680
signs

239
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:15,598
of phosphate in the atmosphere so

240
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,199
phosphine like every other molecule has

241
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,279
a unique spectroscopic

242
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,319
fingerprint meaning it rotates and

243
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,198
vibrates in

244
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,919
special ways i calculated how many of

245
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,360
those ways

246
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:30,159
it can rotate vibrate it is 16.8 billion

247
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,240
ways what this means is that if you look

248
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,680
at the spectrum of light

249
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,080
and that light has gone through

250
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:40,478
phosphine gas on the other end

251
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:43,759
there should be 16.8 billion tiny marks

252
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,639
left indentations left in that spectrum

253
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:48,720
we found one of those on venus one of

254
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,759
those 16.8 billion

255
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,200
so now the game is can we find any of

256
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,958
the other ones

257
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,120
yeah but they're really hard to spot

258
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:59,439
they're all in terrible places in the

259
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,440
electromagnetic spectrum

260
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,360
and the instruments we use to find this

261
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,040
one can't really

262
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,278
find any other one there's another one

263
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,039
of the 16.8 billion we could find but

264
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,120
it would take many many days of

265
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:13,039
continuous observations and that's not

266
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
really in the cards right now

267
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,240
i mean how do you there's all kinds of

268
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,440
noise first of all

269
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,039
yes there's uh all kinds of other

270
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:25,279
signal so how do you

271
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,799
separate all of that out to pull out

272
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,439
just this particular

273
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:30,958
signature that's associated with

274
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,600
phosphine

275
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,719
so the data kind of looks somewhat like

276
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,720
a wave

277
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,639
and a lot of that is noise and it's a

278
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,320
bass line and so if you can

279
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,240
figure out the exact shape of the wave

280
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,240
you can cancel that shape out and you

281
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,080
should be left with a straight line

282
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,560
and if there's something there an

283
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,080
absorption so a signal

284
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,639
so that's what we did we tried to find

285
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,800
out what was this baseline shape

286
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,559
cleaned it out and got the signal that's

287
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:00,240
part of the problem if you do this wrong

288
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:03,599
you can create a signal but that signal

289
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:06,159
is at 8.904 wavenumbers

290
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,800
and we actually have more digits than

291
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,120
that

292
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,599
but i don't remember by heart and an

293
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,639
alma in particular is a very very good

294
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,720
telescope array of telescopes and it can

295
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,879
focus on exactly that frequency

296
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,480
and in that frequency there are only two

297
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,879
known molecules

298
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,039
um that absorb at all so that's how we

299
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,039
do it we look at that exact spot where

300
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:30,078
we know fasting absorbs

301
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,480
the other molecule is so2

302
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,159
if there is extraterrestrial life

303
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:38,959
whether it's on venus

304
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:40,799
or on exoplanets where you looked before

305
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,159
how does that make you feel how should

306
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,838
it make us feel

307
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:47,759
should we be scared should we be excited

308
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:48,880
let's say it's not intelligent life

309
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,559
let's say it's

310
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:53,120
microbial life it's uh is it a threat to

311
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,319
us

312
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,480
are we a threat to it or is it only not

313
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,560
only but mostly a possibility to

314
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,159
understand something fundamental

315
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,559
something beautiful about life in the

316
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,120
uni

317
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:06,000
in the universe hard to know he would

318
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,600
have to bring

319
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,639
on a poet or a philosopher on the show

320
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,920
uh i you don't feel i feel those things

321
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,799
i just don't know if those are the right

322
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:16,559
things to feel

323
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:18,879
i don't certainly don't feel scared i

324
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:20,719
think it's rather silly to feel scared

325
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,919
definitely don't touch them um you know

326
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,959
sometimes in

327
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,159
movies you don't go near it don't

328
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:29,759
interfere

329
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:32,240
i think one of the things with venus is

330
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,799
because of phosphine now there is a

331
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,120
chance

332
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:40,078
that venus is inhabited and in that case

333
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,959
we shouldn't go there we should be very

334
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:45,679
careful with messing with them

335
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:47,919
and bringing our own stuff there that

336
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,000
contaminates it

337
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,838
and venus has suffered enough if there's

338
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,519
life there it's probably the

339
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,000
remains of a living planet the very last

340
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,240
survivors of

341
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,759
what once was potentially a thriving

342
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,200
world and so

343
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,200
i don't want our first interaction with

344
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,600
alien life to be

345
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,440
massacre so i definitely wouldn't want

346
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,000
to go near out of a

347
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,160
let's say galactic responsibility

348
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,919
galactic ethics

349
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:18,159
and i often think of you know alien

350
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:19,679
astronomers watching us and

351
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,679
how disappointed they would be if we

352
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,519
mess this up so i really

353
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:25,679
i really want to be very careful with

354
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,919
anything that could be life

355
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,919
but certainly i wouldn't be scared

356
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:30,719
humans are plenty capable of killing one

357
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,399
another we don't

358
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,399
you know we don't need extraterrestrial

359
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,480
help to destroy ourselves

360
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,240
scared mostly of other humans exactly

361
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,959
but these this life

362
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,039
if there is life there it does seem just

363
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:46,159
like you said it would be pretty rugged

364
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,679
it's like the cockroaches or or chuck

365
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,000
norris i don't know it's the

366
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,799
some kind of um it's something that

367
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,958
survived

368
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,838
through some very difficult conditions

369
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:55,838
that doesn't mean

370
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,000
it would handle us you know it could be

371
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,240
like war of the worlds

372
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,839
you come just because you're resilient

373
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,799
in your own planet doesn't mean you can

374
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,440
survive another

375
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,799
even our extremophiles which are very

376
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,399
impressive we should all be very proud

377
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:10,159
of our extremophiles

378
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,839
they wouldn't really make it in the

379
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,159
venusian clouds

380
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,800
so i wouldn't expect because you're

381
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:18,879
tough even chuck norris stuff

382
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,399
that you would survive on an alien

383
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,679
planet uh

384
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,000
and and then from the scientific

385
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:26,799
perspective you don't want to pollute

386
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,839
the the data gathering process but we're

387
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,759
showing up there

388
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,040
the observer can can affect the observed

389
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,319
how heartbreaking would it be if we

390
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:34,879
found life on another planet and then

391
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,519
we're like

392
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,159
oh we we brought it with us it was my

393
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,560
sandwich

394
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,078
but that's always the problem right and

395
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,119
it's certainly a problem with mars

396
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:48,000
because we visited the that

397
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,759
that if there is life on mars or like

398
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,360
remains of life on ours

399
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,439
it's always going to be a question of

400
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,879
like well maybe we planted it there

401
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,480
let's not do the same with venus

402
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:58,240
it's harder because when we try to go to

403
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,480
venus and things melt

404
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,159
very quickly yeah and so it's pretty

405
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,120
it's a little harder to

406
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:06,719
pollute venus um it's very good at

407
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,440
destroying

408
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,240
foreigners yeah well in terms of elon

409
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,480
musk and

410
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,519
terraforming planets mars is stopped

411
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,800
number one then

412
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,639
venus may be after that so

413
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,958
uh can we talk about phosphine a little

414
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,680
bit um so you mentioned it's a pretty

415
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:25,759
i love fossee what's your twitter handle

416
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,239
that's like dr phosphene it's dr faustin

417
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,600
yes

418
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,198
you will be surprised here it wasn't

419
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,240
taken already i could just i just

420
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:33,359
grabbed it

421
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:36,240
didn't have to buy it off anyone yeah

422
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:38,079
so what uh what is it what's phosphine

423
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,039
you already mentioned it's pretty toxic

424
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,719
and

425
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:45,120
um troublesome and what and

426
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,120
outside

427
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,879
so maybe what are some things that uh

428
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:56,159
make it interesting

429
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:59,120
chemically and why is it

430
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,240
a good sign of life uh one is present in

431
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,120
the atmosphere

432
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:05,039
like you've described in your paper uh

433
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,039
aptly titled the phosphine as a

434
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:08,240
biosignature gas in exoplanet

435
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:10,319
atmospheres

436
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,000
i suppose you wrote that paper before

437
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,959
venus i did yes

438
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,480
it did and no one cared you know in that

439
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:18,719
paper i said something like

440
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,480
if we find phosphine on any terrestrial

441
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,680
planet can only mean life and everyone's

442
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,159
like yeah that sounds about right let's

443
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,599
go

444
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,198
and then venus shows up and i was like

445
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,720
are you sure i'm like

446
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:32,559
i was sure before i was sure now

447
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,680
that it's right here um i'm less sure

448
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:37,278
now that my claims are being tested

449
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,439
so phosphine fascinating is a

450
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,720
fascinating molecule so it's shaped like

451
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,320
a pyramid

452
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,759
with a phosphorus up top and then three

453
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,440
hydrogens

454
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,800
it's actually quite a simple molecule in

455
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,279
many ways and

456
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:50,799
you know it's the most popular elements

457
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,958
in the universe

458
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,639
carbon hydrogen nitrogen oxygen

459
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,479
phosphorus sulfur

460
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,839
when you add hydrogen to them it makes

461
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,320
quite simple quite

462
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,759
famous uh molecules you know you do it

463
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,920
to oxygen you get water

464
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,919
you do it to carbon you get methane you

465
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,360
do it to nitrogen you get ammonia

466
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,599
these are all molecules people have

467
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:12,000
heard of but you do it to phosphorus

468
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,839
you get phosphine people haven't heard

469
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,480
of phosphene because

470
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,160
it's not really popular on earth um we

471
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,120
really shouldn't find it anywhere on

472
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,240
earth

473
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:25,759
because it is extremely toxic to life

474
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,959
it interacts with oxygen metabolism and

475
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,320
everything you know and love uses oxygen

476
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,439
metabolism

477
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,839
and it interacts fatally so it kills in

478
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,519
several very imaginative and very

479
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,639
macabre ways

480
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,240
so it was used as a chemical warfare

481
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:45,759
agent in the first world war and

482
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,799
most recently by isis so really bad

483
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,399
most life avoids it even life that might

484
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,278
not avoid it so life that doesn't use

485
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,360
oxygen metabolism anaerobic life

486
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,120
still has to put crazy amounts of effort

487
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,000
into making it it's a really difficult

488
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,000
molecule to make

489
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,759
thermodynamically speaking it's really

490
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,078
difficult to make that phosphorus want

491
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,679
to be together with that hydrogen

492
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,519
so it's horrible everyone avoids it when

493
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,120
they're not avoiding it is extremely

494
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,679
difficult to make you would have to put

495
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,239
energy

496
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,759
in sacrifice energy to make it and if

497
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:19,199
you did go through all that trouble

498
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,798
and made it it gets um reacted with the

499
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,160
radicals in the atmosphere and gets

500
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:23,679
destroyed

501
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,439
so we shouldn't find it anywhere and yet

502
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,640
we do it's kind of

503
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:30,640
weird molecule that seems to

504
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,440
be made by life and we don't even know

505
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,960
why life clearly finds a use for it

506
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,200
it's not the only molecule the life is

507
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,120
willing to sacrifice energy to make but

508
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,319
we don't know how or why life is even

509
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:46,159
making it so absolutely mysterious

510
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,839
absolutely deadly smells horrifically

511
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,360
when it's made it produces other kind of

512
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:51,279
diphosphines and

513
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,439
it's been reported as smelling like

514
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,038
garlicky fishy death

515
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:56,798
uh once someone referred to it as

516
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:57,519
smelling like the let me see if i

517
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,480
remember the

518
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:00,960
the rancid diapers of the spawn of satan

519
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,079
oh

520
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,319
very nice yeah very very vivid and so

521
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,000
you're a poet after all i didn't i

522
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:10,558
didn't call it that someone else did

523
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,558
and so it's just this horrific molecule

524
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,879
but it is produced by life

525
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:16,558
we don't know why and when it is

526
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,600
produced by life is done with enormous

527
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:20,960
sacrifice

528
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:24,079
and the universe does not sacrifice life

529
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,919
sacrifices and so it's this strange

530
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:27,599
contradictory molecule that we should

531
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,600
all be avoiding and yet

532
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:32,480
seems to be an almost unambiguous sign

533
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:34,558
of life on rocky planets

534
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,640
okay can we dig into that a little bit

535
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,678
so what on rocky planets

536
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,720
what uh is there biological mechanisms

537
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,759
that can produce it

538
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,798
and is there is there

539
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:49,839
you said the why is unclear why

540
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:51,679
life might produce it but is there an

541
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,439
understanding of what kind of mechanisms

542
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,840
might be able to produce it this very

543
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,000
difficult to produce

544
00:18:54,839 --> 00:19:00,079
molecule we don't know yet the enzymatic

545
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,839
pathways of fossil production by life

546
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,678
are not yet known

547
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,079
this is not actually as surprising as it

548
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,038
might sound i think something like 80

549
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:11,359
of all the natural products that we know

550
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:13,440
of so we know biology makes them

551
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,038
we don't know how it is much easier to

552
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,720
know life produces something because you

553
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:17,279
can put you know bacteria in a petri

554
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,038
dish

555
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:21,119
and then watch and then that gas is

556
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:23,200
produced you go oh life made it

557
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,119
that actually happened with phosphene

558
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,440
but that's much easier to do of course

559
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,479
than

560
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,798
figuring out what is the exact metabolic

561
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,759
pathway within that life form that

562
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,879
created the

563
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:38,079
this molecule so we don't know yet

564
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,840
phosphene is really understudied um no

565
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,759
one had really heard of it until

566
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:44,079
nowish what you were presenting is the

567
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:46,400
fact that life produces

568
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,678
phosphate not the the process by which

569
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,640
it produces fasting

570
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:53,440
is there an urgency now like if you were

571
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,960
to try to understand the mechanisms

572
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,038
the what did you call enzymatic pathways

573
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,558
that produce phosphine how difficult is

574
00:19:59,038 --> 00:20:02,400
that of a problem to crack

575
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,599
it's really difficult if i'm not

576
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,159
mistaken even

577
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:08,240
you know the scent of truffles obviously

578
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,960
a billion dollar industry

579
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,480
huge deal until quite recently it wasn't

580
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,558
known exactly how those

581
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,558
scents those molecules that create this

582
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,399
incredible smell were produced and this

583
00:20:16,558 --> 00:20:19,839
is a billion dollar industry

584
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,400
as you can imagine there is no such

585
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:25,199
pressure there's no phosphine lobby

586
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,038
or anything that would push for this

587
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,840
research but i hope someone picks

588
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,558
picks it up and does it and it isn't

589
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,879
crazy

590
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,399
because we know that faucino is really

591
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,280
hard to make we know it's really hard

592
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
for her to happen

593
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,759
accidentally you know even lightening

594
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:41,359
and volcanoes that can produce small

595
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:42,879
amounts of phosphine

596
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,558
it's extremely difficult for even these

597
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,480
extreme processes to make it

598
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,079
so it's not really surprising that only

599
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:52,079
life can do it because life

600
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:55,439
is willing to make things at a cost

601
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:58,000
so maybe on the topic of phosphine what

602
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,200
uh again you're you've gotten yourself

603
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
into trouble with that i'm going to ask

604
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,159
you all these like

605
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,279
high-level poetic questions i apologize

606
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,320
no i would love it

607
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:09,839
okay what when did you first

608
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:12,399
fall in love with phosphine

609
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:14,558
it wasn't love at first sight it was

610
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,840
somewhere between

611
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,558
a long relationship and stockholm

612
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:21,119
syndrome

613
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,158
yeah yeah when when i first started my

614
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:24,639
phd

615
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:26,400
i knew i wanted to learn about molecular

616
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,000
spectra and how to simulate it

617
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,240
i thought it was really outrage

618
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,240
outrageous that we as a species

619
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,640
couldn't detect molecules remotely we

620
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,240
didn't have this perfect catalogue ready

621
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,759
of the molecular fingerprint of every

622
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,000
molecule we may want to find in

623
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,038
the universe and something as basic as

624
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,960
phosphine

625
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,240
the fact that we didn't really know how

626
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
it interacted with light

627
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,159
and so we couldn't detect it properly

628
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,038
you know in the galaxy

629
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,400
just i was so indignant and so initially

630
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,319
i just

631
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,679
started working on phosphine because

632
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,599
people hadn't before

633
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,440
and i thought we should know what

634
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:02,319
phosphine looks like

635
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,440
that was it and then i read every paper

636
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:04,240
that's ever been published about

637
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,840
phosphine

638
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,440
it was quite easy because there aren't

639
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,879
that many

640
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,400
and that's when i started learning about

641
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,440
where we had already founded

642
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,960
in the universe and what it meant um i

643
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,840
started finding out quite how little we

644
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,279
know about it

645
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:23,199
and why and it was only when i

646
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,038
joined mit and i started talking to

647
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:27,840
biochemists

648
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,759
that the that have been became clear

649
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,839
that fossen wasn't just

650
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:33,359
weird and special and understudied and

651
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,599
disgusting

652
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,719
it was all these things for oxygen

653
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:39,279
loving life

654
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,240
and it was the anaerobic world that

655
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:44,240
would welcome phosphine and that's when

656
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,240
the idea of looking for it on other

657
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:49,120
planets became crystallized

658
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,120
because oxygen is very powerful and very

659
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,639
important on earth but

660
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,798
that's not necessarily going to be the

661
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,480
case on other exoplanets most planets

662
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,879
are oxygen pole

663
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,599
overwhelmingly most planets are oxygen

664
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,840
poor

665
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:03,519
and so finding the sign of life that

666
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:06,720
would be welcomed by

667
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:07,519
everything that would live without

668
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:11,679
oxygen

669
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:11,679
on earth seemed so cool

670
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,919
and but ultimately the project the first

671
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,200
is born of the idea that you want to

672
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,480
find that molecular

673
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,360
fingerprint of any of a

674
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,480
molecule so and that this is just one

675
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,079
example

676
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:30,798
and that's connected

677
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,079
to then looking at for looking for that

678
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:35,038
fingerprint elsewhere in

679
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:36,960
in a remote way and obviously that then

680
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,558
at that time were exoplanets already

681
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,720
when you were doing your phd and you

682
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:44,639
by those should say your phd thesis was

683
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,079
on it wasn't it's all on phosphine 100

684
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,320
with a little bit of pneumonia i have a

685
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,558
chapter that i i did

686
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:51,759
where i talked about phosphine and

687
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,720
ammonia so i

688
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,000
got it but no phosphine is very much my

689
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,000
thesis um but at that

690
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,159
that at that time when you're writing it

691
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,038
there's already a sense that exoplanets

692
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,520
are out there

693
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:05,759
and uh we might be able to be looking

694
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:08,879
for bio signatures for

695
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:11,440
um on those exoplanets pretty much so i

696
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,600
finished my phd in 2015

697
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,558
we found the first exoplanets in the

698
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,759
kind of mid to late

699
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,000
90s so exoplanets were known it was

700
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:20,640
known

701
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,400
that some had atmospheres and from there

702
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,520
it's not a big jump to think well if

703
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,840
some have atmospheres

704
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,038
some of those might be habitable and

705
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:31,199
some of those may be

706
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:34,079
inhabited so how do you

707
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,080
detect you started to talk about it but

708
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:39,359
can we linger on it how do you detect

709
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:40,240
phosphine on a far away thing rocky

710
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:43,519
thing

711
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:46,798
rocky planet what uh what is

712
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,599
uh spectroscopy what is this molecular

713
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:49,679
fingerprint

714
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:50,719
what does it look like you've kind of

715
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,080
mentioned the wave

716
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,240
but what are we what are we supposed to

717
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:56,000
think about what are the tools

718
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,759
what are the uncertainties all those

719
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,240
kinds of things so the

720
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,519
the path can go this way you've got

721
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,480
light

722
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:05,359
kind of pure light you can crack that

723
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,480
light open

724
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:11,678
with a prism or a spectroscope or water

725
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,720
and make a rainbow that rainbows all the

726
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,880
colors

727
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,120
and all the invisible colors the

728
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,440
ultraviolet the infrared

729
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:21,839
and if that light was truly pure you

730
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,558
could consider that rainbow to just

731
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,639
cover continuously all of these colors

732
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,480
but if that light goes through a gas

733
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:31,038
we may not see that gas we certainly

734
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,919
cannot see the molecules within that gas

735
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:35,200
but those molecules will steal absorb

736
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,320
some of

737
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,960
that light some but not all each

738
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,119
molecule

739
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,558
absorbs only very specific colors of

740
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,479
that rainbow

741
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:45,839
and so if you know for example that

742
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,480
shade of green

743
00:25:45,839 --> 00:25:49,678
can only be absorbed by methane then you

744
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,919
can watch

745
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,440
as a planet passes in front of a star

746
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,159
the planet is too far away you can't see

747
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,159
it

748
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,600
and it has an atmosphere that atmosphere

749
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,640
is far too small you definitely can't

750
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,399
see it

751
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,000
but the sunlight will go through that

752
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,960
atmosphere and if that atmosphere is

753
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,679
methane

754
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,960
then on the other side that shade of

755
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,679
blue i can't remember if i said blue

756
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:12,880
green but that color will be missing

757
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,320
because methane took it and so with

758
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,000
phosphene it's the same thing

759
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:20,720
it has specific colors 16.8 billion

760
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,839
colors that it absorbs it and nothing

761
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,759
else does

762
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,038
and so if you can find them and notice

763
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,000
them missing

764
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:29,839
from the light of a star that went

765
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,278
through a planet's atmosphere

766
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,038
then you'll know that atmosphere

767
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,119
contains the molecule

768
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,519
how cool is that that's incredible so

769
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:39,359
you can have this

770
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,879
fingerprint within the space of colors

771
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:42,000
and there's a lot of molecules and i

772
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,360
mean i would i wonder

773
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,359
that's a question of like how much

774
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,519
overlap there is how how

775
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:48,479
close can you get to the actual

776
00:26:47,519 --> 00:26:51,440
fingerprint like

777
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,159
can phosphine unlock the iphone with its

778
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,360
lights on

779
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:58,799
he says 16.8 billion so

780
00:26:55,359 --> 00:27:00,959
presumably this rainbow is discretized

781
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:02,960
into little segments somehow exactly how

782
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,480
many total are there

783
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,400
how how how a lot is 16.8 billion

784
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,679
it's a lot you we don't have the

785
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,400
instruments to

786
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:14,080
break these break any light into this

787
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,480
many tiny segments

788
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,558
and so with the instruments we do have

789
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,759
there's huge amounts of overlap

790
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:24,798
methane as an example a lot of the ways

791
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:27,599
it's detectable is because

792
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,200
the carbon and the hydrogens they

793
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:30,480
vibrate with one another they move they

794
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:33,519
interact

795
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:36,880
but every other hydrocarbon acetylene

796
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:39,599
isoprene has carbon and hydrogens

797
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,120
also vibrating and rotating and so it's

798
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:44,558
actually very hard to tell them apart

799
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:46,798
at low resolutions and our instruments

800
00:27:44,558 --> 00:27:50,000
can't really cope with distinguishing

801
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,720
between molecules particularly well

802
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,159
but in an ideal world if we had infinite

803
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,720
resolution then yes

804
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,720
every molecule spectral features will be

805
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,880
unique

806
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,000
yeah like almost too uni like it would

807
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,520
be too trivial

808
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,919
at the quantum level at our level

809
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:10,879
uh there's huge overlap yeah but then

810
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,880
you can start to then

811
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,119
what try to disambiguate like what the

812
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,720
mis

813
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,959
the fact that certain colors are missing

814
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,159
what does that mean and hopefully

815
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,919
they're missing a certain kind of

816
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,919
pattern where you can say with some kind

817
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,640
of probability that's this gas not this

818
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,399
gas

819
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,240
or you're solving that gaseous puzzle

820
00:28:28,398 --> 00:28:31,599
i got it okay we can go back to venus

821
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,759
actually and and show that

822
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,599
so with this i mentioned those two

823
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:37,200
molecules that could be responsible for

824
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,599
that signal at the resolution that we

825
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,640
have

826
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:44,158
it was phosphine and so2 um

827
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,240
sulfur dioxide and at that resolution

828
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:48,159
could really be one of the other but in

829
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,519
that same bandwidth so in the kind of

830
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,520
the same observations

831
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,278
there was another region where phosphine

832
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:56,720
does not absorb we know that

833
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:59,919
but so2 does so we just went unchecked

834
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:02,159
and there was no signal so we thought oh

835
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,038
then it must be phosphene and then we

836
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,039
submit to the paper

837
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,918
the rest is history i got it uh well

838
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,038
yeah

839
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,200
that's beautifully told

840
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,919
is there so the telescopes we're talking

841
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:21,440
about are sitting on earth

842
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:22,799
what can it help solving this

843
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,000
fingerprint molecular

844
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:28,319
fingerprint problem if we do a flyby

845
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,359
does it help if we get closer and closer

846
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,839
or are telescopes pretty damn good

847
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,359
for this kind of uh puzzle solving

848
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,038
subscripts are pretty good but the

849
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:39,038
earth's atmosphere

850
00:29:37,038 --> 00:29:40,798
is a pain i mean i'm very thankful for

851
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:43,200
it but

852
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:43,839
it does interrupt a lot of measurements

853
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,000
and a lot of

854
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,119
regions where phosphine would be active

855
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,240
they are not available

856
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:53,119
the earth is not transparent

857
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,120
in those wavelengths so being above the

858
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:57,599
atmosphere would make a huge difference

859
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,239
then proximity matters a lot less but

860
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:00,000
just

861
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,919
escaping the earth's atmosphere would be

862
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,119
wonderful but then it's really hard to

863
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,919
stay very stable

864
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,359
and if there is phosphate on venus

865
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:10,559
there's very little of it

866
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:11,199
in the clouds and so the signal is very

867
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:14,398
weak

868
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,798
and the telescopes we can use on earth

869
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,879
are

870
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:18,319
much bigger and much more stable so it's

871
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,360
a bit of a trade-off

872
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,278
so is it

873
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:24,398
are you um with this kind of remote

874
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:27,679
observation

875
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:30,959
is it at all helpful to uh

876
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:34,080
strive for going over to venus and like

877
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,480
grabbing a scoop of the atmosphere

878
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,158
or is remote observation really a a

879
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,839
powerful tool

880
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:41,600
for this kind of job like the scoop is

881
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:43,678
not necessary

882
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,798
well a lot of people want to scoop i get

883
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,000
it

884
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:50,079
i get it inclination yeah i don't want

885
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,480
to scoop specifically because if it is

886
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,359
life

887
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,038
i want to know everything i can remotely

888
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,199
before i interfere

889
00:30:55,038 --> 00:30:59,038
um so that's my i've got ethical reasons

890
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,558
against the scoop more than engineering

891
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:02,158
reasons against the scoop

892
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:03,759
but i have some engineering reasons

893
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,278
against the scoop scoop is not a

894
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:05,919
technical term but i feel like now it's

895
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:07,599
too late

896
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,840
thank you for going along with this it's

897
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:11,359
too late to take it back i appreciate it

898
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:13,439
we don't understand the clouds well

899
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,839
enough to plan the scoop

900
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,080
very well because it's not that uh

901
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,038
saturated like there's not that much of

902
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:22,398
it present

903
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,879
no and the place is nasty you know it's

904
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:24,479
not

905
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,159
it's not going to be easy to build

906
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,200
something that can do

907
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:31,919
the task reliably and can be trusted

908
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,038
the measurements can be trusted and then

909
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,679
passed that message on

910
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:37,359
so actually i'm for an orbiter i think

911
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:39,840
we should have orbiters around

912
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:42,158
every solar system body whose job is

913
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,398
just to learn about these places

914
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,200
i'm disappointed we haven't already got

915
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:47,759
an orbiter

916
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,120
around every single one of them a small

917
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:50,798
it can be a small satellite

918
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:53,199
schlotting data figuring out you know

919
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:54,720
how do the clouds move what's in them

920
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,038
how often is there lightning and

921
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,798
volcanic activity where's the topography

922
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,599
is it changing

923
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,720
is there a biosphere actively doing

924
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,918
things we should be

925
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,798
monitoring this from afar and so i'm for

926
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,440
uh

927
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:10,079
over the atmosphere hopefully around

928
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,640
venus

929
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:14,480
that would be that would be my choice

930
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,720
okay so now

931
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,120
recently venus is all exciting about

932
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:21,278
phosphine and everything is there

933
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:23,038
is there other stuff maybe before we

934
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:26,798
were looking at venus or now

935
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:29,278
looking out into other solar systems

936
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:32,000
is there other promising exoplanets or

937
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:34,798
other planets within the solar system

938
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
that might have phosphine or might have

939
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,960
other

940
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,558
strong biosignatures that we should be

941
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:44,159
looking for

942
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:46,558
like phosphine there's a few but

943
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,240
outside the solar system all are kind of

944
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,240
promising candidates

945
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,480
we know so little about them for most of

946
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,960
them we barely know their density

947
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,079
um most of them we don't even know if

948
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,079
they have an atmosphere

949
00:32:56,079 --> 00:33:00,240
never mind what that atmosphere might

950
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,439
contain so we're still very much the

951
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,839
stage where

952
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,200
we have detected promising planets but

953
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,439
they're promising in that

954
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,558
they're about the right size about the

955
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,640
right density

956
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:11,599
they could have an atmosphere and

957
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:13,679
they're about the right

958
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:14,959
distance from their host star but that's

959
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,038
really all we know

960
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,640
near future telescopes will tell us much

961
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:21,519
more but

962
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,480
for now we're just guessing so you said

963
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,839
near future so

964
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,679
there's hope that there will be

965
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,678
telescopes that can see that far

966
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,960
enough to to determine if there's an

967
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,480
atmosphere and

968
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,120
perhaps even the contents of the

969
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,319
atmosphere absolutely jwst launching

970
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:37,839
later this year

971
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:40,960
will be able to get a very rough sense

972
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:43,599
of the main atmospheric constituents of

973
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,240
planets that could potentially be

974
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:46,240
habitable

975
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,759
and that's this here you know what's the

976
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,240
name of jwst

977
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,079
the james webb space telescope okay and

978
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,200
that's going to be out in space past the

979
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:54,960
atmosphere

980
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,798
yes is there something interesting to be

981
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,759
said about the engineering aspect of the

982
00:33:56,798 --> 00:33:59,918
telescope

983
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,119
i mean it's an incredible beast but it's

984
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,960
a beast of many

985
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:08,000
burdens so it's going to do

986
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,720
it's good see you are a poet

987
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,039
yeah i love it this is very eloquent i

988
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,480
love

989
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:14,639
you're speaking to the audience which i

990
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:17,039
appreciate

991
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,760
uh so so yes it's a giant engineering

992
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:20,000
project

993
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,599
and uh is it orbiting something do you

994
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,559
know so it's going to be above the

995
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,800
atmosphere

996
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,559
um and it will be doing lots of

997
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,839
different astrophysics and so

998
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:32,719
some of its time will be dedicated to

999
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:35,519
exoplanets but there's an entire

1000
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,959
astronomy field fighting for time

1001
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:42,159
before the cryogenic lifetime of the

1002
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,720
um instrument and so when i was looking

1003
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,800
for

1004
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,598
the possibility of finding phosphine on

1005
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,560
distant exoplanets i used jwst

1006
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,079
as a way of checking with this

1007
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:53,918
instrument that we will launch

1008
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,480
later this year could we detect

1009
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:59,358
phosphine on an oxygen poor planet

1010
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,320
and there i put very much a hard stop

1011
00:34:59,358 --> 00:35:01,920
where

1012
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,359
some of my simulations said yes you can

1013
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:06,079
totally do it but it will take

1014
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:06,880
a little under the cryogenic lifetime of

1015
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,039
this machine

1016
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,880
so then i had to go well that that's not

1017
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:13,119
going to no one's going to dedicate all

1018
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,320
of jwst to look for my

1019
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,920
molecule that no one cared about so

1020
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,280
we're very much at that edge but

1021
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,960
there'll be many other telescopes in the

1022
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,440
coming decades

1023
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,039
that will be able to tell us quite a lot

1024
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,559
about the atmospheres of potentially

1025
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,559
habitable planets

1026
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:30,000
so you mentioned simulation this is

1027
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,719
super interesting to me and

1028
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,400
and this perhaps could be a super dumb

1029
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:37,519
question but

1030
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,720
no i just think i'm gonna prove you

1031
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:41,358
wrong in that one

1032
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:42,639
you simulate molecules to understand how

1033
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,159
they look from a distance

1034
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:45,679
is what i understand like what does that

1035
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,039
simulation

1036
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:51,358
look like so it's uh it's talking about

1037
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:52,800
the the which colors of the rainbow will

1038
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:54,799
be missing is that

1039
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,800
the goal of the simulation that's the

1040
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,599
goal but it's really just a very

1041
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,720
very nasty schrodinger's equation so

1042
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,960
it's a quantum

1043
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:04,799
simulation it's simulating at the

1044
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,320
quantum level yes so i'm a quantum

1045
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,560
astrochemist

1046
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,519
hi i'm clara i'm a quantum astrochemist

1047
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,719
how we should have started this

1048
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:13,119
conversation

1049
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:14,159
can you describe the three components of

1050
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,960
that

1051
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,719
quantum astro and chemist and how they

1052
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,760
interplay together

1053
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,639
so i study the quantum behavior of

1054
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,520
molecules

1055
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:27,279
hence the quantum and the chemist

1056
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,960
specifically so i can detect them

1057
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:34,079
in space and see astro

1058
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,800
so what i what i do is i figure out the

1059
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,400
probability of a molecule being in a

1060
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,720
particular state

1061
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,240
there's no deterministic nature to the

1062
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:45,679
work i do it so it's

1063
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:47,519
every transition is just a likelihood

1064
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,399
but if you get a population of that

1065
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,239
molecule it will always happen

1066
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,320
and so this is all at the quantum level

1067
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:56,319
it's a stronger equation on

1068
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,680
i think 27 dimensions i don't remember

1069
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,920
it by hard

1070
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:01,199
and what this means is i'm solving these

1071
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:04,400
giant

1072
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:05,919
quantum matrices and that's why you need

1073
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:09,119
a lot of computer power

1074
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,720
giant computers to diagonalize these

1075
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,000
enormous matrices

1076
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:17,279
each of whom describes a single

1077
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:22,320
vibrational behavior of a molecule

1078
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:25,839
so i think phosphine has 17.5 million

1079
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,160
possible states it can exist in

1080
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:29,838
and transitions can occur between pairs

1081
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,279
of these states

1082
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:32,799
and there's a certain likelihood that

1083
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,599
they'll happen this is the quantum world

1084
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,680
nothing is

1085
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,119
deterministic there's just a likelihood

1086
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:38,319
that it will jump from one state to

1087
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,440
another

1088
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:44,000
and these jumps they're transitions and

1089
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,320
there's 16.8 billion of them

1090
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,358
when energy is absorbed that corresponds

1091
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:49,200
to this transition

1092
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,639
we see it in the spectrum this is more

1093
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:51,439
quantum chemistry than you had asked for

1094
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:54,719
i'm sorry no

1095
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,400
no i'm sorry brain is broken so when the

1096
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,159
when the transitions happen between the

1097
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,880
different states

1098
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:01,519
uh somehow the energy maps the spectrum

1099
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,320
exactly

1100
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:06,000
energy corresponds to a frequency and a

1101
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,000
frequency corresponds to a wavelength

1102
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,719
which corresponds to a color

1103
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,838
so there's some probability assigned to

1104
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:13,598
each color then

1105
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:15,440
exactly and that probability determines

1106
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,320
how intense that transition will be

1107
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,880
how strong and so you run this kind of

1108
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,119
simulation for a particular

1109
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,119
so that's 17.5 squared or something like

1110
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,920
that exactly

1111
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:30,400
17.5 million energies each one of whom

1112
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:32,559
involves diagonalizing a giant matrix

1113
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,480
with a supercomputer which i wonder what

1114
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,480
the most efficient algorithm for the

1115
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,480
diagonalization is but there there's

1116
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,199
something there's many

1117
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,400
depends on kind of the shape of the

1118
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:44,078
matrix so they're not

1119
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,760
random matrixes so some are more

1120
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,240
diagonal than others and

1121
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,160
so some need more treatment than others

1122
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:52,078
most of the work ends up going in

1123
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,759
describing the system this quantum

1124
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,280
system in different ways until you have

1125
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,119
a matrix that is

1126
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,480
close to being diagonal and then it's

1127
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,640
much easier to

1128
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,679
clean it up so how how many uh how hard

1129
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:05,519
is this puzzle

1130
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,960
so you're solving this puzzle for

1131
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:10,400
phosphine right

1132
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,400
um is this are we supposed to solve this

1133
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,559
puzzle for every single

1134
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,720
molecule oh boy yes i calculated if i

1135
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,880
if i did the work i did for phosphine

1136
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:21,838
again for all the molecules for which we

1137
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,200
don't have

1138
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:25,519
spectra for which we don't have a

1139
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:29,039
fingerprint it would take me

1140
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:30,800
62 000 years a little over 62

1141
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:32,159
000 years what time flies when you're

1142
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,240
having fun okay

1143
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:37,440
but you uh you write that there are

1144
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,919
about 16 000 molecules we care about

1145
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,880
when looking for a new earth or when we

1146
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,880
try to detect alien biosignatures

1147
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,599
if we want to detect any molecules from

1148
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,760
here we need to know their spectra

1149
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,920
and we currently don't solving this

1150
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,480
particular problem

1151
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,599
that's my job what was that that i mean

1152
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,358
that's absolutely correct

1153
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:58,800
yeah i could have could have not said it

1154
00:39:57,358 --> 00:39:59,838
better myself did you take that from my

1155
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,160
website yeah i think i

1156
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:02,880
stole it and your website is excellent

1157
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,358
so it's

1158
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,880
worthy place to steal stuff from how do

1159
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:09,759
you solve this problem

1160
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,119
uh of for the 16 000 molecules we care

1161
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,880
about

1162
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:18,079
of which phosphine is one yes and so

1163
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,240
um so taking a step a little bit out of

1164
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,280
fossil

1165
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:25,039
is there uh but we were having so much

1166
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,319
fun it was having so much fun no we're

1167
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:27,920
not saying no no no

1168
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:29,599
it's sticking around i'm just saying

1169
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,559
we're joining more friends coming to the

1170
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,400
party

1171
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,239
how do you choose other friends to come

1172
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,119
to the party that are interesting to

1173
00:40:34,239 --> 00:40:37,838
study

1174
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,119
as we solve one puzzle at a time through

1175
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:41,679
the space of 16

1176
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,720
000. so we've already started out of

1177
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:44,559
those 16 000

1178
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:46,559
we understand water quite well methane

1179
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:49,519
quite well ammonia quite well

1180
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,199
carbon dioxide i could keep going and

1181
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:52,159
then we understand molecules like

1182
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,679
acetylene

1183
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:57,679
hydrogen cyanide more or less

1184
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,039
and that takes us to about four percent

1185
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:01,118
of those sixteen thousand

1186
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:04,000
we understand about four percent of them

1187
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:07,119
more or less phosphine is one of them

1188
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,838
but the other 96 we just really have

1189
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:11,920
barely any idea at all of where

1190
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:14,639
in the spectrum of light they would

1191
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,119
leave a a mark

1192
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,239
i can't spend the next 62 000 years

1193
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:21,039
doing this work

1194
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:21,519
um and i don't want to even if you know

1195
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:24,639
somehow

1196
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,239
i was able that that's not that that

1197
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,480
wouldn't feel good

1198
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:29,358
so one of the things that i try to do

1199
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,559
now

1200
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:33,759
is move away from how i did phosphene so

1201
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,159
i did phosphine

1202
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:37,440
really the best that i could the best

1203
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,480
that could be done with the computer

1204
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,119
power that we have

1205
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,400
you know trying to get each one of those

1206
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:46,318
16.8 billion transitions

1207
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:49,280
mapped accurately calculated

1208
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:49,759
and then i thought what if i do a worse

1209
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,880
job

1210
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:55,680
what if i just do a much worse job um

1211
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,039
can i just make it much faster and then

1212
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,838
it's still worth it

1213
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,639
like how bad can i get before it's

1214
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:04,078
worthless and then

1215
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,879
could i do this for all the other

1216
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,599
molecules so i created exactly this

1217
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,559
terrible

1218
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:11,039
terrible it's a system how about it so

1219
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,559
how

1220
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,239
what's the answer to that question that

1221
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:14,559
fundamental question asks myself all the

1222
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:16,318
time

1223
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:17,759
in other domains how crappy can i be

1224
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:19,279
before i'm useless before somebody

1225
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,319
notices

1226
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:24,720
turns out pretty crappy because

1227
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,079
no one has any idea what these molecules

1228
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:28,879
look like

1229
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,440
anything is better than nothing and so i

1230
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,358
thought

1231
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,880
how long will it take me to create

1232
00:42:31,358 --> 00:42:34,559
better than nothing spectra

1233
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,079
for all of these molecules and so i

1234
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,358
created rascal

1235
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:42,800
rapid approximate spectral calculations

1236
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:45,440
for all um and

1237
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,480
what i do is i use organic chemistry and

1238
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,720
quantum chemistry

1239
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,920
and kind of cheat at them both i just

1240
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,639
try to figure out

1241
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,039
what is the fastest way i could run this

1242
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:56,239
and

1243
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:58,000
i simulate rough spectra for

1244
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,358
all of those 16 000 so i've managed to

1245
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,880
get it to work

1246
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:02,880
it's really shocking how well it works

1247
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,280
considering how bad it is

1248
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:05,920
is there any insights you could give to

1249
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,400
like the

1250
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,680
the tricks involved in making it fast

1251
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:13,599
like what are the

1252
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:16,000
um maybe some insightful shortcuts taken

1253
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:17,920
that still result in some useful

1254
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,318
information about the spectra

1255
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,000
the insights came from organic chemistry

1256
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,400
from decades ago

1257
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,000
when organic chemists wanted to know

1258
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,800
what a compound might be they would look

1259
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,358
at a spectrum

1260
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,880
and see a feature and they would go i've

1261
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:32,239
seen that feature before

1262
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:34,079
that's usually what happens when you

1263
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:36,559
have a carbon triple bonded

1264
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,119
to another carbon and they were mostly

1265
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:38,719
right

1266
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,480
almost every molecule that has a carbon

1267
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:43,199
triple bonded to another one

1268
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,920
looks like that has other features

1269
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:45,759
different

1270
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,838
that distinguish them from one another

1271
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,119
but they have that that feature in

1272
00:43:47,838 --> 00:43:52,000
common

1273
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,480
we call these functional groups and so

1274
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:56,239
most of that work ended up being

1275
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,079
abandoned because now we have mass

1276
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,679
spectrometry we've got nuclear magnetic

1277
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,240
resonance spectroscopy so

1278
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,960
people don't really need to do that

1279
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,919
anymore

1280
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,519
but these ancient textbooks still exist

1281
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,920
and i've collected them

1282
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:11,440
all as many as i could and there are

1283
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,880
hundreds of these descriptions where

1284
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,079
people have said

1285
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,079
oh whenever you have a

1286
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,160
iodine atom connected to this one

1287
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
there's always a feature here and it's

1288
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:23,039
usually quite

1289
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,560
sharp and it's quite strong and some

1290
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:25,358
people go oh yeah that's a really broad

1291
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,159
feature every time

1292
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:29,199
that combination of atoms and bonds so

1293
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:31,039
i've collected them all

1294
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,799
and i've created this giant dictionary

1295
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:35,519
of all these kind of

1296
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,200
puzzle pieces these lego parts of

1297
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,119
molecules

1298
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:40,960
and i've written a code that then puts

1299
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:43,760
them all together in some kind of like

1300
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,440
frankenstein's monster of molecules so

1301
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,240
you ask me for any molecule and i go

1302
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,960
well it has

1303
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,399
these bonds and this atom dangling off

1304
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,358
this atom and

1305
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,039
this cluster here and i tell you what it

1306
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,920
should look like

1307
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,039
and it kind of works so this creates a

1308
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,480
whole uh

1309
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:04,000
portfolio of just kind of uh signatures

1310
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,920
that we can look for

1311
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,880
very rough pictures but still useful

1312
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:12,639
enough to analyze the atmospheres

1313
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:16,318
the the telescope generated images of

1314
00:45:12,639 --> 00:45:19,838
other planets close right now

1315
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,719
it is so complete so it has all of these

1316
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:22,960
molecules

1317
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,358
that it can tell you say you look at an

1318
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,159
alien atmosphere and there's a feature

1319
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:30,358
there it can tell you oh that feature

1320
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:34,000
that's familiar it could be one of these

1321
00:45:30,358 --> 00:45:35,598
816 molecules best of luck yes

1322
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,920
so i think the next step which is what

1323
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,599
i'm working on is telling you something

1324
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,680
more useful than it could be one of

1325
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,000
those 816 molecules that's still

1326
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:44,879
true i wouldn't say it's useful so i can

1327
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,519
tell you

1328
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:49,440
but only 12 percent of them also have a

1329
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:51,280
feature in this region so go look there

1330
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:53,200
and if there's nothing there it can't be

1331
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,359
those and so on

1332
00:45:53,199 --> 00:45:57,118
it can also tell you things like you

1333
00:45:55,358 --> 00:46:00,078
will need this much accuracy to

1334
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:03,280
distinguish between those 816

1335
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,318
so that's what i'm working on but it's a

1336
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,040
lot of work

1337
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:08,559
so this is really interesting the like

1338
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,079
the role of computing in this whole

1339
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,358
picture you mentioned code

1340
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:16,400
so like you as a quantum

1341
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:18,880
astro chemist there is some role

1342
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,480
of for programming in your life in your

1343
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:22,160
past life in your current life

1344
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,920
oh yeah almost entirely i'm a

1345
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:25,279
computational quantum astrochemist

1346
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,200
but that doesn't roll off the tongue

1347
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,319
very easily so this is fundamentally

1348
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:29,759
computational

1349
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:31,838
like if you want to be successful in the

1350
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,680
21st century and doing quantum master

1351
00:46:31,838 --> 00:46:34,960
chemistry you want to be computational

1352
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:37,838
absolutely all quantum chemistry is

1353
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:40,400
computational at this point okay

1354
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:41,440
does machine learning play a role at all

1355
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,599
is there some

1356
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,960
extra shortcuts that could be discovered

1357
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,800
through uh

1358
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,240
like you see all that success with

1359
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,440
protein folding right

1360
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:53,519
a problem that thought to be extremely

1361
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:54,559
difficult to apply machine learning to

1362
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:57,838
because

1363
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:57,838
it's um

1364
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,559
i mean mostly because there's not a lot

1365
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:05,680
of already solved

1366
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,119
puzzles to train on i suppose the same

1367
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,799
exact thing is true

1368
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,400
with this particular problem but is

1369
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,119
there hope for machine learning to help

1370
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:13,838
out

1371
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,358
absolutely currently you've laid out

1372
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:18,799
exactly the problem the

1373
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,400
training set is awful and because

1374
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,000
there's so

1375
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,318
a lot of this data that i'm basing it on

1376
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,400
is literally many decades old the people

1377
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:29,519
who worked on it and data that i get

1378
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:30,639
often they're dead and the files that

1379
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:32,880
i've used they

1380
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,400
some of them were hand drawn by someone

1381
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,960
tired in the 70s

1382
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,400
yes so i could of course have yeah have

1383
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,920
a program

1384
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,920
training on these but i'll just be

1385
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,318
perpetuating these mistakes without hope

1386
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,760
of actually verifying them so my next

1387
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:49,519
step is to

1388
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,440
improve this training set um by hand

1389
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,119
and then try to see if i can apply

1390
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,880
machine learning on the full code of the

1391
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,760
full 16 000 molecules

1392
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,358
and improve them all but really i need

1393
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:01,040
to be able to test the outcomes

1394
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:03,440
with experimental data which means

1395
00:48:01,039 --> 00:48:04,800
convincing someone in a lab to spend a

1396
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:07,920
lot of money

1397
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,960
putting very dangerous gases in chambers

1398
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:12,000
and measuring them

1399
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,280
at outrageous temperatures so it's a

1400
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,039
work in progress

1401
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,800
and so collecting huge amounts of data

1402
00:48:15,039 --> 00:48:20,079
about the actual gases

1403
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,920
uh so you see you so you

1404
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:23,280
you are up for doing that kind of thing

1405
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:26,559
too so

1406
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,880
actually like doing the full

1407
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:31,440
end to end thing which is like having a

1408
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,760
gas collecting data about it

1409
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,519
and and then doing the kind of analysis

1410
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:38,000
that creates the fingerprint

1411
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,599
and then also analyzing using that

1412
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,318
library the data that comes from other

1413
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,599
planets

1414
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:46,000
so you do the full fall from birth to

1415
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:47,680
death interesting um yes i worked in an

1416
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,159
industrial chemistry laboratory when i

1417
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:51,039
was

1418
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,000
much younger in slovenia and there i

1419
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:54,159
worked in the lab

1420
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,400
actually collecting spectrum and and

1421
00:48:54,159 --> 00:48:57,838
predicting spectrum

1422
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,079
what's it like to work with a bunch of

1423
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:00,639
gases that are like not so human

1424
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,359
friendly

1425
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:04,719
it's terrifying it's horrific it's so

1426
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:07,039
scary and

1427
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,719
i love my job i'm willing to clearly

1428
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:12,400
sacrifice a lot for it

1429
00:49:08,719 --> 00:49:15,519
you know job stability money

1430
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,400
yes sanity but

1431
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:20,239
i only worked there for a few months it

1432
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,720
it was really terrifying

1433
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:24,239
there's just so many ways to die you

1434
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:25,519
know usually you only have a handful of

1435
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:27,358
ways to die every day

1436
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:28,800
you know but if you work in a lab

1437
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,598
there's so many more

1438
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,400
orders of magnitude more and i i was

1439
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,760
very bad

1440
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:38,960
at it i'm not a good hands-on scientist

1441
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,480
i want a laptop connected to a remote

1442
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,280
supercomputer

1443
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,079
or a laptop connected to a telescope yes

1444
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,720
i don't

1445
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:49,599
i don't need to be there to believe it

1446
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:51,118
and i am not good in the lab

1447
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:52,480
yeah when there's a bunch of things that

1448
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,160
can poison you a bunch of things that

1449
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,199
could explode and they're gaseous and

1450
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,199
they're often

1451
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,598
maybe they might not even have a smell

1452
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:01,358
or they might not be visible

1453
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,519
it's like so many of them give you

1454
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:06,880
cancer it's just so cruel

1455
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:08,880
and some people love this work but i've

1456
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,800
i've never enjoyed experimental work

1457
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:14,559
it's so ungrateful

1458
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:15,920
it's so lonely well most i mean so much

1459
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:18,000
work is lonely

1460
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,838
if you find the joy in it but you you

1461
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,920
enjoy the results of it

1462
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:24,159
yes i'm very thankful for all the

1463
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:26,400
experimentalists in my life

1464
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,679
but i i'll do the theory they do the

1465
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,000
experiment and then we talk to one

1466
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,598
another and make sure it matches

1467
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,559
uh okay beautiful what are uh

1468
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:36,318
spectroscopic networks those

1469
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,079
look super cool are they related to what

1470
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:38,800
we were talking about the picture look

1471
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:41,359
pretty

1472
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,318
oh and yes slightly so remember when i

1473
00:50:41,358 --> 00:50:47,759
mentioned the 17.5 million energy levels

1474
00:50:44,318 --> 00:50:48,318
yes there are rules for each molecule on

1475
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:51,440
which

1476
00:50:48,318 --> 00:50:53,679
energy levels they can jump from and to

1477
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,119
and how likely it is to make that jump

1478
00:50:53,679 --> 00:50:57,838
and so if you

1479
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,480
plot all the roots it can take you get

1480
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,239
this

1481
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,240
energy network for which is like a ball

1482
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:05,838
so these are the constraints of the the

1483
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:08,479
transitions that could be taken

1484
00:51:05,838 --> 00:51:10,400
exactly for each molecule interesting

1485
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,280
and no they're not so it's not a fully

1486
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,400
connected

1487
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:16,720
it's like it's it's sparse somehow yes

1488
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,280
you get island sometimes you get

1489
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,199
a molecule can only jump from one set of

1490
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,000
states to another and it's trapped now

1491
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:24,399
in this network

1492
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,000
it can never go to another network that

1493
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:28,400
could have been available to

1494
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,920
other siblings is there some insights to

1495
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,280
be drawn from these networks

1496
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,800
like something cool that you can

1497
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,839
understand about a particular molecule

1498
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,079
because of it

1499
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,599
yes some molecules have what we call

1500
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,880
forbidden transitions

1501
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,480
and which aren't really forbidden

1502
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,280
because it's quantum there are no rules

1503
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,760
no

1504
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,760
there are rules it's just the rules are

1505
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:47,599
very often broken in the quantum world

1506
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:49,040
and so forbidden transitions doesn't

1507
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:51,440
actually mean they're forbidden

1508
00:51:49,039 --> 00:51:52,558
low probability exactly they just become

1509
00:51:51,440 --> 00:51:54,639
deeply unlikely

1510
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:56,079
yeah cool and so you could do all the

1511
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:57,679
same like i'm

1512
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,760
coming from a computer science world you

1513
00:51:57,679 --> 00:52:02,078
know i love graph theory

1514
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,400
so you can do all the same like craft

1515
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,760
theoretic kind of analysis of like

1516
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,079
clusters or something like that

1517
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,280
or all those kinds of things and draw

1518
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,960
insights from me

1519
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:13,920
they're unique for each molecule so

1520
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:16,159
these the networks that you mentioned

1521
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,559
that's actually not too difficult a

1522
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:21,039
layer of quantum physics by then all the

1523
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,119
energies are mapped so we've had high

1524
00:52:21,039 --> 00:52:24,480
school children work on those networks

1525
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,920
and the trick is to not tell them

1526
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,440
they're doing quantum physics until like

1527
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,960
three months in when it's too late for

1528
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,000
them to back out

1529
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,159
and then you're like you're a quantum

1530
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:34,719
physicist now and it's really nice

1531
00:52:32,159 --> 00:52:35,199
yeah okay but like the promise of this

1532
00:52:34,719 --> 00:52:37,439
even though

1533
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,358
16 000 even just a subset of them that's

1534
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,358
really exciting because then you can do

1535
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:43,440
as the telescope data get better and

1536
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:46,880
better especially for exoplanets

1537
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:49,440
but also for venus you can then

1538
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,960
start like getting your full like you

1539
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:52,800
know how you get like blood work done or

1540
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,559
like you get your genetic testing to see

1541
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,039
what your ancestors are

1542
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:58,559
you can get the same kind of like high

1543
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,079
resolution information about

1544
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,760
interesting things going on on a

1545
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,119
particular planet based in the

1546
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,640
atmosphere right exactly

1547
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,358
how cool would that be if we could you

1548
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:08,799
know scan an alien planet and go

1549
00:53:07,358 --> 00:53:10,400
oh this is what the clouds are made of

1550
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,400
this is what's in the surface

1551
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,800
these are the molecules that are mixing

1552
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,559
here are probably oceans because you can

1553
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:20,318
see these types of molecules above it

1554
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:23,200
and here are the hadley cells here are

1555
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:24,239
how the biosphere works we could map

1556
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:25,838
this whole thing

1557
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,679
wouldn't it be cool if the aliens like

1558
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:28,719
are aware of these techniques and like

1559
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:31,519
would spoof like

1560
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:32,480
the wrong gases just like pretend that's

1561
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,800
how they can be

1562
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,358
it's like an invisibility cloak they can

1563
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:39,920
generate gases that would throw you off

1564
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:40,558
or like or do the opposite they pretend

1565
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,240
they will

1566
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,720
artificially generate phosphate and so

1567
00:53:42,239 --> 00:53:46,879
they like the dumb

1568
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,639
the dumb apes on earth again like go out

1569
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:50,079
like flying in different places

1570
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:52,078
because it's just fun it's like some

1571
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:54,800
teenager alien

1572
00:53:52,079 --> 00:53:56,000
somewhere just pranking yeah uh but i

1573
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,000
was asked that exact question

1574
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,358
this saturday by uh by a

1575
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,789
seventy-year-old boy in

1576
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,759
canada old seven seven years yes

1577
00:54:01,789 --> 00:54:05,279
[Laughter]

1578
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:06,880
but it was the first time i'd been asked

1579
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,839
that question this is the second in a

1580
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:12,400
week

1581
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:15,679
um we're kindred spirits him and i

1582
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,639
we can um they can prank us to some

1583
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:19,279
extent

1584
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,480
but the this work of interpreting an

1585
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,559
alien atmosphere

1586
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,000
means you're reading the atmosphere as a

1587
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:26,720
message and it's very

1588
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,039
hard to hide signs of life in an

1589
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:30,959
atmosphere because

1590
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:32,159
you can try to prank us but you're still

1591
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,880
going to fart

1592
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:36,159
and breathe and somehow metabolize the

1593
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,000
environment around you

1594
00:54:36,159 --> 00:54:39,199
yeah and call that whatever you call

1595
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,519
that uh

1596
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:42,879
and release molecules and so that's

1597
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,920
really hard to hide

1598
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:48,240
you know you can go very quiet you can

1599
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,960
throw out some weird molecule to confuse

1600
00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:50,838
us further

1601
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,960
but we can still see all your other

1602
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:55,279
metabolites it's hard to fake

1603
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:56,559
uh is there so you kind of mentioned

1604
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,480
like water

1605
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:03,040
what um what other gases are there

1606
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,240
that we know about that are like high

1607
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:07,199
likelihood

1608
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:10,399
as bio signatures in terms of life i

1609
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:13,118
mean what are your other favorites

1610
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,440
inter so so we got phosphine but like

1611
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:16,720
what

1612
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:17,119
uh what else is a damn good signal to be

1613
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:18,719
uh

1614
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,160
that you think about that we should be

1615
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,439
looking for if we look at another

1616
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:23,039
atmosphere

1617
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,720
is there gases that come to mind or are

1618
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,039
there all sort of

1619
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,798
possible bio signatures that we should

1620
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:31,679
love equally

1621
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:33,199
there's many so there's water we know

1622
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:34,000
that's important for life as we know it

1623
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:36,078
there's molecular

1624
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,679
oxygen on earth that's probably the most

1625
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:40,079
robust sign of life particularly

1626
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:41,519
combined with small amounts of methane

1627
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,280
and it's true that the majority of the

1628
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:46,000
oxygen in our atmosphere is

1629
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:47,200
a product of life and so if i was an

1630
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:50,239
alien astronomer

1631
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:52,558
and i saw earth's atmosphere i'm

1632
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:53,919
i would get a nobel i think on you know

1633
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,119
what would you notice i mean this is

1634
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,519
really

1635
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,318
i would be very excited about this about

1636
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:01,519
the oxygen

1637
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:02,079
about fighting 20 21 of oxygen

1638
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:04,079
atmosphere

1639
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,000
that's very unusual so would that be the

1640
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:07,119
most exciting thing to you from an alien

1641
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,358
perspective about earth

1642
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:10,720
in terms of detect like analyzing the

1643
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:12,960
atmosphere like what are the

1644
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:13,358
biosignatures of life on earth would you

1645
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,639
say

1646
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:17,119
in terms of the contents of the

1647
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:17,920
atmosphere is oxygen high amount of

1648
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:20,240
oxygen

1649
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:22,000
pretty damn good sign i mean it's not as

1650
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:22,879
good as the tv signals we've been

1651
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,079
sending out

1652
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:29,119
those those are slightly more robust

1653
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:30,000
than oxygen oxygen on its own has false

1654
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,240
positives for life

1655
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,440
so there's still ways of making it but

1656
00:56:32,239 --> 00:56:36,000
it's it's

1657
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,599
a pretty robust sign of life in the

1658
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:40,318
context or atmosphere with the

1659
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,240
radiation that the sun produces our

1660
00:56:40,318 --> 00:56:44,480
position in relation to the sun

1661
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,558
the other components of our atmosphere

1662
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,280
the volcanic activity we have

1663
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:49,839
all of that together makes the 20 of

1664
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,680
oxygen

1665
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:55,759
extremely um robust sign of life

1666
00:56:53,679 --> 00:56:57,199
but outside that context you could still

1667
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:00,000
produce

1668
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:01,598
oxygen without life but phosphine

1669
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,519
although better in the sense of

1670
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,798
it is much harder to make it has lower

1671
00:57:03,519 --> 00:57:07,599
false positives

1672
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:08,960
still has some so i'm actually against

1673
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:11,280
looking for

1674
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,599
specific molecules unless we're looking

1675
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,559
for like cfcs if we find cfcs that's

1676
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,720
definitely aliens i feel confident

1677
00:57:15,559 --> 00:57:18,720
chlorofluorocarbons

1678
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,719
and so you know if aliens had been

1679
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:23,838
watching us they would be going oh

1680
00:57:20,719 --> 00:57:25,519
no cfcs i mean yeah

1681
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:27,358
they're not gonna last long let's you

1682
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:28,639
know everyone's writing their thesis on

1683
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:31,679
the end of

1684
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:33,199
the end of the earth and then we got

1685
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:34,480
together we stopped using them

1686
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:36,719
i like to think they're really proud of

1687
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,079
us um you know they literally saw our

1688
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:39,759
ozone hole shrinking

1689
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,440
they've been watching it and they saw it

1690
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,720
happen i think they'll be honest they're

1691
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,599
more paying attention to the whole

1692
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:45,199
nuclear thing

1693
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,960
that's just i think they care it's not

1694
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:49,039
gonna bother them oh i mean worried

1695
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:50,720
about us oh yes oh no worried about us

1696
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,719
they i mean this is why the aliens have

1697
00:57:50,719 --> 00:57:54,639
been showing up recently uh

1698
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:56,558
it's like if you if you look at i mean

1699
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,920
there is i mean it's probably

1700
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:00,559
there's a correlation with a lot of

1701
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:02,079
things but what the ufologists quote

1702
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:05,200
unquote often talk about

1703
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:07,680
is that there seems to be a much

1704
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:09,519
higher level of ufo sighting since like

1705
00:58:07,679 --> 00:58:11,279
in the nuclear age

1706
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:13,599
so like if aliens were indeed worried

1707
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,720
about us like if you were aliens you

1708
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:17,359
would start showing up

1709
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:20,159
when the the living organisms have first

1710
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:23,598
discovered a way to destroy the entire

1711
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:26,480
the uh the entire colony can um

1712
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:28,160
the uh increase in sightings not have to

1713
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,599
do with the fact that people now have

1714
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:31,440
more cameras

1715
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:33,440
it's an interesting thing about science

1716
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:36,798
like with ufo sightings

1717
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:39,280
it's it's like either 99

1718
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:40,079
of percent of them are false or 100 of

1719
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,079
them are false

1720
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:44,318
the interesting thing to me is in that

1721
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:48,000
point zero one percent

1722
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:50,480
there's a lot of things in science that

1723
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,838
are like these weird outliers they're

1724
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,440
difficult to replicate

1725
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:54,880
you have like there's even physical

1726
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,200
phenomena ball lightning

1727
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,838
there's difficult things to artificially

1728
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:02,239
create in large amounts or observe

1729
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:03,279
in nature in large amounts in such a way

1730
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:05,519
that you can do to

1731
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,720
apply the scientific method that could

1732
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:10,079
be just things that like

1733
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:10,879
what happened like a few times like or

1734
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:13,200
once

1735
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,880
and you're like what the hell is that

1736
00:59:13,199 --> 00:59:16,399
and that that's very difficult

1737
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:18,318
for science to know what to do it i'm a

1738
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:19,119
huge proponent of just being open-minded

1739
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:20,960
because

1740
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:23,200
when you're open-minded about aliens for

1741
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,440
example is

1742
00:59:23,199 --> 00:59:27,358
it allows you to think outside the box

1743
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,280
in other domains as well

1744
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:31,440
and somehow that will result like if you

1745
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,280
open mind about aliens

1746
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,480
and you don't comp you know don't laugh

1747
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,079
it off immediately

1748
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:37,838
what happens is somehow that that's

1749
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,519
going to lead to a solution to p equals

1750
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:42,318
np or p not equals np

1751
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:43,920
like in ways that you can't predict the

1752
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,400
open mindedness has

1753
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,440
tertiary effects that will result in

1754
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,599
progress i believe

1755
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:51,599
which is why i'm a huge fan of aliens

1756
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:53,760
because it's like

1757
00:59:51,599 --> 00:59:55,920
because too many scientists roll their

1758
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,640
eyes at the idea of aliens

1759
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,960
alien life and to me it's one of the

1760
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:02,318
most

1761
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:05,440
exciting possibilities uh in the

1762
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:08,400
biggest most exciting questions

1763
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:10,480
before all of human civilization so to

1764
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:12,880
roll your eyes

1765
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,318
is not the right answer to roll your

1766
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,240
eyes presumes that you know

1767
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,079
anything about this world as opposed to

1768
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:19,358
just knowing point zero zero zero one

1769
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,640
percent of this world

1770
01:00:19,358 --> 01:00:26,000
and so being humble in the face of that

1771
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:29,199
uh being open to the possibility of is

1772
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,079
uh visiting earth is a good idea not

1773
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:32,159
everything though

1774
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,519
i'm not so open-minded to the flat earth

1775
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:36,318
uh hypothesis

1776
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:37,119
is there's a growing number of people uh

1777
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:39,440
believing in

1778
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:41,200
but even then or the inner earth i've

1779
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,000
got shouted out in a public talk about

1780
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:44,558
it

1781
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,880
so like the earth is hollow yeah my

1782
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:49,839
understanding is that there's an

1783
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,798
this conspiracy theory that as far as i

1784
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:52,719
can tell has

1785
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:54,318
no grounding in reality is that there's

1786
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:56,239
a slightly smaller earth

1787
01:00:54,318 --> 01:00:57,599
inside this one which is just too cute

1788
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:59,439
as a concept

1789
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,960
um and you can access it i think from

1790
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:03,039
antarctica and

1791
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:06,318
that's where we keep and i quote the

1792
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,318
mammoths and the nazis

1793
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:10,318
yeah i mean that one is ridiculous but

1794
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,239
like i do like hey i thought you were

1795
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:12,798
keeping an open mind i am this is this

1796
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:14,639
is

1797
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:16,318
i genuinely think that's more likely

1798
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,400
than aliens visiting the earth and i say

1799
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:21,679
this as someone who has dedicated

1800
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:24,880
her life to finding like alien life and

1801
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:27,838
and so that's how improbable

1802
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,280
i think the visitations are because

1803
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:32,318
interstellar distances are

1804
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,640
so huge that it's just not really worth

1805
01:01:32,318 --> 01:01:34,159
it

1806
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:36,159
see i i have a different view on this

1807
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:39,118
whole thing i think the

1808
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:40,078
aliens that look like little green men

1809
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,960
are

1810
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:45,200
like extremely low probability event

1811
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,639
like mammoths and nazis

1812
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:52,000
yeah that's similar but

1813
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:56,480
but other kind of ideas like

1814
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:56,480
the the sad thing to me and i think

1815
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,920
in my view if there's other alien

1816
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:03,279
civilizations out there

1817
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,519
and they visited earth neither them

1818
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,720
or perhaps just us would be even able to

1819
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:08,719
detect them

1820
01:02:06,719 --> 01:02:10,159
like we we wouldn't be open-minded

1821
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:13,358
enough to see it

1822
01:02:10,159 --> 01:02:16,000
like if if

1823
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:17,440
because our understanding of what is

1824
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:20,000
life

1825
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,559
and i just talked to sarah walker who's

1826
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,519
uh

1827
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:25,920
you know sarah yeah we talked for three

1828
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:27,920
hours about the question what is life

1829
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,039
there's a good person to talk to about

1830
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:30,639
what is life

1831
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:33,039
but like the whole point is we don't

1832
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:33,519
really we have a very narrow-minded view

1833
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,920
of what

1834
01:02:33,519 --> 01:02:37,440
is life and when it shows up and it

1835
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:41,599
might be already here

1836
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,599
um trees and dolphins and so on

1837
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:46,880
and or or mountains or i don't know or

1838
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:51,119
the

1839
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:53,760
or the molecules in the atmosphere or um

1840
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,400
or like i people make fun of me but i do

1841
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:56,640
think that

1842
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,318
ideas are kind of aliens themselves or

1843
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,759
consciousness could be the aliens

1844
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:01,759
or it could be the method by which they

1845
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,359
communicate we don't know about the

1846
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:05,359
way our human mind works

1847
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:06,960
and the fact that this thing is a

1848
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:09,598
quantum process

1849
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,318
please don't i i understand this it's

1850
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,640
not woo

1851
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:14,318
i'm not i could but it very well could

1852
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,318
be there could be something at the

1853
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:18,079
at the physics level right it could be

1854
01:03:16,318 --> 01:03:19,358
at the chemical or the biological level

1855
01:03:18,079 --> 01:03:21,280
things that are happening that we're

1856
01:03:19,358 --> 01:03:23,679
just close too close-minded

1857
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:24,960
because our conception of life is at the

1858
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:28,078
level of

1859
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:31,280
like us like at the jungle level

1860
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:33,039
of mammals and on the time scale that's

1861
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:34,400
the human time scale we may not be able

1862
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,920
to perceive

1863
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:40,798
what alien life is actually like

1864
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:43,119
what on the scale at which their

1865
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,719
intelligence realizes itself we may not

1866
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,240
be able to perceive

1867
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:48,719
and the other thing that's really

1868
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:51,679
important about alien visitations

1869
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:53,919
whether it happened or not is especially

1870
01:03:51,679 --> 01:03:56,000
after covet in 2020

1871
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,838
i'm losing a little bit of faith of our

1872
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:01,039
government being able to handle that

1873
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:05,440
that well not our government but us as

1874
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:08,640
a society as a collective being able to

1875
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:11,920
deal with new things in an effective way

1876
01:04:08,639 --> 01:04:13,358
that's inspiring that's efficient that

1877
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:16,559
uh

1878
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:17,759
like whether it's if it's a dangerous

1879
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:19,920
thing to deal with it

1880
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,039
to alleviate the danger whether it's the

1881
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,599
possibility of

1882
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,920
new discoveries and something inspiring

1883
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,039
to ride that wave and make it inspiring

1884
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:29,039
all those kinds of things

1885
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,240
i honestly think if aliens showed up

1886
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:31,920
they would look around

1887
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:33,919
everybody would ignore them and the

1888
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:36,079
government might like hide it

1889
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:37,519
try to like see to keep it from the

1890
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,359
chinese and the russians if it's the

1891
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:41,199
united states

1892
01:04:39,358 --> 01:04:42,719
call it a military secret in a very

1893
01:04:41,199 --> 01:04:44,480
close-minded way

1894
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:45,919
and then the bureaucracy would drawn it

1895
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,240
away to where uh

1896
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:50,480
through paperwork the poor aliens would

1897
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,879
just like waste away in a cell somewhere

1898
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:54,960
like there's a certain that would never

1899
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:57,280
happen part of the reason that i feel so

1900
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:58,639
confident that aliens have not visited

1901
01:04:57,280 --> 01:05:00,400
because they would have had to visit

1902
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,719
just to have a look remotely

1903
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:04,240
you know from neptune or something which

1904
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,798
makes no sense because interstellar

1905
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:09,439
travel

1906
01:05:04,798 --> 01:05:10,798
is so difficult that it would be

1907
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,079
quite a ridiculous proposition but

1908
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:13,358
that's the bit that i think is

1909
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,960
technically possible

1910
01:05:13,358 --> 01:05:18,000
if they did come here and they were

1911
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:20,240
visible by anyone detectable by anyone

1912
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:22,159
the thought that any government no

1913
01:05:20,239 --> 01:05:23,919
matter or any military could just

1914
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:25,838
contain them these beings

1915
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,599
are capable of traveling interstellar

1916
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:30,719
distances when we can

1917
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:32,318
barely go to the moon like barely go to

1918
01:05:30,719 --> 01:05:35,439
the moon these things be way way way

1919
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:37,920
way and the fact that we think our puny

1920
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,200
military if any even if all the military

1921
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,358
in the world got together

1922
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:42,318
and the fact that they could somehow

1923
01:05:41,358 --> 01:05:45,679
contain this

1924
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:46,639
it's that it's trying to contain a human

1925
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:48,879
that visited them

1926
01:05:46,639 --> 01:05:50,318
exactly but and scientists you would

1927
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,559
have to bring scientists on board

1928
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:53,838
you've met a lot of scientists how good

1929
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:55,960
are they keeping secrets

1930
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:58,639
because in my experience they're

1931
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,519
absolutely appalling at keeping secrets

1932
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:01,279
yeah that's terrible

1933
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:03,199
even the phospho-non-venus thing which

1934
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,798
was a pretty well-kept secret

1935
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:06,480
this is true you had a bunch of people

1936
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:09,759
that were i told my dad

1937
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:11,440
yeah you know my dad knew and

1938
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,119
hopefully didn't tell anyone but if it

1939
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,200
had been an alien visiting he probably

1940
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:18,559
would have told them mate you know

1941
01:06:15,199 --> 01:06:18,960
and so these secrets could not be kept

1942
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,720
by

1943
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:22,400
any scientist that i know and certainly

1944
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:24,318
not collaborative scientists which would

1945
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:27,358
be needed you need all sorts of

1946
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:30,798
um scientific teams so between the

1947
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:34,000
pathetic power of any world's

1948
01:06:30,798 --> 01:06:35,119
military compared to any civilization uh

1949
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:38,239
capable of traveling

1950
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:41,599
and our absolute inability to keep

1951
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:43,439
secrets uh uh absolutely not

1952
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:45,838
i will bet everything that we have not

1953
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:46,880
been visited because we are too pathetic

1954
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:49,199
to hold that

1955
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,559
well let me hold that truth if we're

1956
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:53,679
making it like a 10

1957
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:57,039
bet there's a possibility here

1958
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:59,440
that the main say there exists one alien

1959
01:06:57,039 --> 01:07:01,680
other intelligent alien civilization in

1960
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:05,358
the galaxy

1961
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:07,199
the pa to me the if they visit earth

1962
01:07:05,358 --> 01:07:09,038
was going to visit earth is like the

1963
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,759
crappy

1964
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,559
like the really crappy short straw yeah

1965
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,599
yeah like

1966
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:17,839
like this this like really dumb

1967
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:19,280
thing that's uh i don't know like the

1968
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:20,639
early game boys or something

1969
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:23,440
and there's a cartoon about this there's

1970
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:26,318
an alien that gets sent to earth

1971
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:28,318
a commander spiff or something and it's

1972
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:29,920
kind of a punishment or something uh

1973
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:32,000
but that's not possible that's the thing

1974
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,960
because interstellar distances are so

1975
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:35,039
hard to

1976
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,400
to cross you have to do it on purpose

1977
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,880
you have to do on purpose it has to be a

1978
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:39,358
big

1979
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,880
big deal and we know this because yes

1980
01:07:39,358 --> 01:07:43,838
you're right we don't know

1981
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,119
enough about galactic biology we don't

1982
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:47,358
know what the universal

1983
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,680
rules of biology or biochemistry are

1984
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:52,400
because we only have the earth

1985
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:53,440
but we do know that the laws of physics

1986
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,838
are universal

1987
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,119
we can predict behavior in the universe

1988
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:59,599
and then see it happen

1989
01:07:57,119 --> 01:08:00,640
based on these autophysics we know the

1990
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,200
laws of chemistry

1991
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:05,038
are universal we know the periodic table

1992
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:07,199
is all they have to choose from

1993
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,160
so yes there may be some sort of

1994
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:10,879
unimaginable

1995
01:08:08,159 --> 01:08:13,199
intelligence but they still have to use

1996
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,000
the same periodic table that we have

1997
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:15,679
access to

1998
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,000
they still have a finite number of

1999
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:20,639
molecules they can do things with

2000
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,319
so they still have to use the resources

2001
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,079
around them the stars around them the

2002
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,480
universe around them and we know how

2003
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:29,600
much energy is in these places

2004
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:32,158
and so yes they may be very capable

2005
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:33,920
capable beyond our wildest dreams but

2006
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:35,358
they're still in the same universe

2007
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,520
and we know a lot of those rules we're

2008
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:40,560
not completely blind but

2009
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,799
there's a colleague here at harvard uh

2010
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,120
uh cameron vaffa he's a theoretical

2011
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:47,278
physicist i don't know if you know him

2012
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:48,880
i've only joined harvard about six

2013
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:50,960
months ago okay

2014
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,640
it's time to meet all the theoretical

2015
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:56,319
physicists uh

2016
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:59,440
so he's a string theorist but uh

2017
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,440
his idea is that uh

2018
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:02,639
aliens that are sophisticated enough to

2019
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:04,719
travel into cells

2020
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:06,480
like those kinds of distances will

2021
01:09:04,719 --> 01:09:08,960
figure out actually ways to hack

2022
01:09:06,479 --> 01:09:09,759
the the fabric of the universe enough to

2023
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,600
have fun

2024
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,158
in other ways like this universe is too

2025
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,520
boring like you would figure out ways to

2026
01:09:14,158 --> 01:09:17,920
create other universes or

2027
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:19,199
like you you go outside the physics as

2028
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,359
we know it

2029
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:22,719
so the reason we don't see aliens

2030
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,159
visiting us all over the place is

2031
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:26,399
they're having fun elsewhere

2032
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:28,318
this is like way too boring we humans

2033
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:30,960
think this is fun but it's actually

2034
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,600
mostly empty space that not no fun is

2035
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:33,838
happening

2036
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:36,000
like there's no fun in visiting earth

2037
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:36,640
for a super advanced civilization so he

2038
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:38,798
thinks like

2039
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,319
if alien civilizations are out there

2040
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:43,039
they found

2041
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,960
outside of our current standard models

2042
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:47,679
of physics ways of having fun

2043
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,079
that don't involve us but that's

2044
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,679
probably

2045
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:52,399
true but even the notion of visiting

2046
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,079
that's so literally pedestrian you know

2047
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,839
of course we want to go there because

2048
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:57,359
going there is the only thing we know we

2049
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:58,319
see a thing we want we want to go there

2050
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,439
and get it

2051
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:04,479
but that is probably something they've

2052
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:06,879
no longer got need for i

2053
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:07,759
specifically don't particularly want to

2054
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:10,159
go to space

2055
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:11,760
it sounds awful you know none of the

2056
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:14,960
things i like are going to be there

2057
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,880
and i my whole work

2058
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,719
is my whole career is finding life and

2059
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:21,920
understanding the universe so i care

2060
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:24,319
a lot but i care about knowing about it

2061
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:25,279
and i feel no need to go there to learn

2062
01:10:24,319 --> 01:10:27,439
about it

2063
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:29,119
and i think as we develop better tools

2064
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:30,399
hopefully people will feel less and less

2065
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:33,519
a need to go

2066
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:35,279
everywhere that we know about and i

2067
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:36,320
would expect any alien civilization

2068
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:39,519
worth their salt

2069
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:41,359
have developed observation tools and and

2070
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,159
tools that allow them to understand

2071
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:46,000
the universe around them and beyond

2072
01:10:44,158 --> 01:10:49,359
without having to go there this

2073
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:50,960
this going is so wasteful yeah so more

2074
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:52,719
focused on the knowledge and learning

2075
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,600
versus the colonization like the the

2076
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,439
conquering and

2077
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:57,199
all those kinds of things that's you

2078
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:59,599
know beneath them

2079
01:10:57,198 --> 01:11:01,198
that's benito that i mean that said do

2080
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,679
you think there's um

2081
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:05,359
any hopeful search for life through

2082
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:08,399
phosphate and other

2083
01:11:05,359 --> 01:11:10,719
gases do you um do you think there's

2084
01:11:08,399 --> 01:11:12,399
other alien civilizations out there

2085
01:11:10,719 --> 01:11:14,158
first do you think there's other life

2086
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:15,759
out there first

2087
01:11:14,158 --> 01:11:18,559
do you think there's life in the solar

2088
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:22,400
system second do you think there's life

2089
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,920
in the galaxy and uh

2090
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:26,238
third do you think there's intelligent

2091
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:27,760
life in the solar system or the galaxy

2092
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:30,238
outside of earth

2093
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,840
so intelligent life i have no idea it

2094
01:11:30,238 --> 01:11:34,158
seems deeply unlikely

2095
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:35,199
uh possible but i'm not even sure if

2096
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:36,719
it's plausible

2097
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:38,399
so that's the special thing to you about

2098
01:11:36,719 --> 01:11:38,880
earth is somehow intelligent life came

2099
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:41,359
yes

2100
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,079
and it's only you know very briefly

2101
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:46,158
probably

2102
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:47,439
extremely briefly uh oh you mean like

2103
01:11:46,158 --> 01:11:49,759
it's always going to be like we're going

2104
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:52,158
to destroy ourselves exactly oh boy

2105
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:54,239
and life will continue on earth happily

2106
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:55,920
uh probably more happily um

2107
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:57,919
so trees and the dolphins will be here

2108
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,640
i'm telling you and the cockroaches and

2109
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,279
the

2110
01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:02,000
incredible fungi you know they'll be

2111
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:04,880
fine

2112
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,840
uh so life on earth will be fine it was

2113
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:09,199
fine before us and will be fined after

2114
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,199
us so i'm not that worried

2115
01:12:09,198 --> 01:12:12,719
about intelligent life but i think it is

2116
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:14,879
unlikely even on earth

2117
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:16,319
is unlikely out of what is it five

2118
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,760
billion species across the history of

2119
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:19,840
the earth yes

2120
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,440
there's been one an intelligent one and

2121
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:24,800
for a blink of an eye

2122
01:12:21,439 --> 01:12:27,439
possibly not much longer than that so i

2123
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,640
i wouldn't bet on that at all though i

2124
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:32,158
would love it of course

2125
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:34,480
you know i i wanted to

2126
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:37,279
find aliens since i was a little girl

2127
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:38,879
and so of course i

2128
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:40,559
initially wanted to find ones that i

2129
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:42,239
could be friends with

2130
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:44,080
and i've had to let go of that dream

2131
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:45,759
because it's so deeply implausible

2132
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:47,359
but see the nice and sorry to interrupt

2133
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,800
but the nice thing about intelligent

2134
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:50,799
alien civilizations

2135
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:52,320
they may have more biosignatures than

2136
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:55,039
non-intelligent ones

2137
01:12:52,319 --> 01:12:56,079
so they might be easier to detect that

2138
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,519
would be the hope

2139
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:59,279
on earth that's not the case but it

2140
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:00,239
could be the case elsewhere oh it's not

2141
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:01,759
the case on earth

2142
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:05,839
most of the biosignatures we have on

2143
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,520
earth are created by quite simple life

2144
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,079
if you don't count pollution pollution

2145
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,080
is all well

2146
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:17,519
so you don't see uh polluting gases

2147
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:18,479
as a as a possible like i look for

2148
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,880
polluting gases

2149
01:13:18,479 --> 01:13:21,839
i would love to find polluting gases

2150
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:23,920
well you know

2151
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,279
i'd be worried for them of course the

2152
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:27,199
same way i

2153
01:13:25,279 --> 01:13:28,800
i think about my alien colleagues all

2154
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:30,479
the time looking at us and i'm sure they

2155
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:34,400
worry about our pollutions

2156
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:36,639
but it would be a really good robust

2157
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:37,920
unambiguous sign of life if we found

2158
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,840
complex pollutants

2159
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,520
so i look for those too i just don't

2160
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:44,560
have any hope of finding them i think

2161
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,560
intelligent life in the galaxy at the

2162
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:50,159
same time that we're looking

2163
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:53,520
is deeply implausible but life

2164
01:13:50,158 --> 01:13:54,399
i think is inevitable and if it is

2165
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,880
inevitable

2166
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:57,839
it is common so i think there will be

2167
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:00,880
life

2168
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:02,000
everywhere in the galaxy now how common

2169
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,079
that life is

2170
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,840
i think will depend a lot on whether

2171
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:06,880
there's life in the solar system beyond

2172
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:09,440
earth

2173
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,159
so i'll adjust my expectations very much

2174
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:13,039
based

2175
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:16,079
on there being life in the solar system

2176
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:19,119
if there's life in the venusian clouds

2177
01:14:16,079 --> 01:14:20,479
if there's life in the if there are by

2178
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:21,760
singers coming out of the plumes of

2179
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:23,919
enceladus

2180
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:26,000
if there's life on titan oh yeah that's

2181
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,880
right and yeah yeah plumes of enceladus

2182
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,880
that's the um

2183
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:30,640
that's the saturn one it's the moon that

2184
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,520
has the geysers that come out and so you

2185
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,159
can't see the

2186
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:34,880
under the subterranean oceans but it's

2187
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:36,559
supposed to

2188
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,159
it's so it would be in the atmosphere i

2189
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,719
was gonna ask you about that one

2190
01:14:38,158 --> 01:14:42,079
uh have you looked at that uh have you

2191
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:44,319
is is that a hope

2192
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:46,238
for you to use the tools you're using

2193
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:50,559
with rascal

2194
01:14:46,238 --> 01:14:52,879
uh and other ways for detecting the 16

2195
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:55,199
000

2196
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,640
molecules that might be biosignatures to

2197
01:14:55,198 --> 01:14:59,279
look at enceladus

2198
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:00,800
yes that's absolutely the plan is that

2199
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:02,238
what's that what's the limiting factor

2200
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,560
in currently is it the

2201
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:05,359
the quality of the telescopes is what's

2202
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:08,080
the what the the

2203
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:09,759
the quality of the data yeah the quality

2204
01:15:08,079 --> 01:15:10,000
of the data the observational data and

2205
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,480
also

2206
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,158
the quality of rascal and other

2207
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:15,759
associated things so we're missing a lot

2208
01:15:14,158 --> 01:15:16,639
of fundamental data to interpret the

2209
01:15:15,760 --> 01:15:19,199
data that we get

2210
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,640
and we don't have good enough data but

2211
01:15:19,198 --> 01:15:23,519
hopefully we will

2212
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,000
in the coming decades we'll get some

2213
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:27,280
information

2214
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:31,198
on titan we have dragonfly going over

2215
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:32,960
uh we'll get the plumes of enceladus

2216
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:34,639
we will look at the clouds of venus and

2217
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:38,158
there's other places and so

2218
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:41,840
if we find any life or any sign of life

2219
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:42,879
ever like on mars then i'll adjust my

2220
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,679
calculations

2221
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,560
and i'll say life is not just inevitable

2222
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:48,800
and common

2223
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:50,159
but extremely common because all of

2224
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:52,719
these places we've mentioned the

2225
01:15:50,158 --> 01:15:55,599
subterranean oceans on enceladus the

2226
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:57,520
methane oceans of titan the clouds of

2227
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:59,600
venus the acidic clouds of venus

2228
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:01,440
these are places that are very different

2229
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,000
from the places where we find life on

2230
01:16:01,439 --> 01:16:04,399
earth

2231
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:06,399
even the most extreme places and so if

2232
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:09,519
life can originate in all of these

2233
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:10,000
completely different habitats then life

2234
01:16:09,520 --> 01:16:12,640
is

2235
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,600
even more resourceful than we thought

2236
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,920
yeah that's really

2237
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:16,800
everywhere that's really exciting if

2238
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:19,279
it's everywhere

2239
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:20,159
if if there's life on just one one of

2240
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:22,238
the moons

2241
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:24,158
if it's on mars anywhere anywhere in the

2242
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:26,399
solar system and i will

2243
01:16:24,158 --> 01:16:29,039
bet everything i own that every solar

2244
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:31,039
system every planetary system has

2245
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:32,158
a potential for habitability you know

2246
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:34,079
because even if they don't have a

2247
01:16:32,158 --> 01:16:37,279
habitable planet they'll have moons

2248
01:16:34,079 --> 01:16:39,920
around other giant planets and

2249
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:40,399
there'll be so much life so for me

2250
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:43,279
that's

2251
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:43,920
the only thing to figure out now whether

2252
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:45,759
life is

2253
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,000
inevitable and quite common throughout

2254
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:50,400
the galaxy or

2255
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,359
everywhere but it's somewhere between

2256
01:16:50,399 --> 01:16:54,719
those two

2257
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:58,000
intelligent life i make no bets and if i

2258
01:16:54,719 --> 01:17:01,039
had to bet i would be against

2259
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,079
yeah to me like two discoveries in the

2260
01:17:01,039 --> 01:17:05,920
21st century

2261
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:09,359
would change everything one

2262
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:11,520
is and maybe i'm biased but

2263
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:12,719
one is a discovery of life in the solar

2264
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:14,880
system

2265
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:16,399
i feel like that would change our whole

2266
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:19,119
conception of

2267
01:17:16,399 --> 01:17:20,879
how unique we are in the universe i i

2268
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:22,000
think i'm much more eager than you are

2269
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,760
to jump from

2270
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:25,039
basic life to intelligent life i feel

2271
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:28,800
like if there's life

2272
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:33,039
everywhere like the odds are

2273
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:35,119
there has like we cannot like you

2274
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:36,238
oh i see you're you're saying there

2275
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:37,519
could have been many intelligent

2276
01:17:36,238 --> 01:17:39,039
civilizations out there that but they

2277
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,640
just keep dying out it's like

2278
01:17:39,039 --> 01:17:43,119
i was detecting them you know ships in

2279
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:46,079
the night ships in the night

2280
01:17:43,119 --> 01:17:46,960
now that's that's ultra sad just like is

2281
01:17:46,079 --> 01:17:48,800
it sad

2282
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,158
a graveyard the earth is not better for

2283
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,440
having us

2284
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:55,920
is it we it doesn't owe us anything

2285
01:17:53,439 --> 01:17:57,439
would you be sad to find alien giraffes

2286
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:59,440
would you be disappointed

2287
01:17:57,439 --> 01:18:01,519
if you found alien giraffes because i

2288
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:02,879
would not no well giraffes

2289
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,640
first of all they look goofy with their

2290
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:06,000
necks and everything but no we do not

2291
01:18:04,640 --> 01:18:08,079
on giraffes

2292
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:09,920
okay giraffes our wondrous animals are

2293
01:18:08,079 --> 01:18:11,439
deeply understudied we still know so

2294
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,800
little about them because no one does

2295
01:18:11,439 --> 01:18:14,879
phds and giraffes

2296
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,840
i am there's a point i made phd and

2297
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:17,119
phosphine

2298
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:18,560
when people aren't doing pgs and

2299
01:18:17,119 --> 01:18:19,279
giraffes we do not know enough about

2300
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,960
giraffes

2301
01:18:19,279 --> 01:18:23,519
i think it was like ricky gervais that

2302
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:25,198
did a whole like a long thing about

2303
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:27,920
your face to talk about giraffes that is

2304
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:29,839
not its expertise

2305
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,520
yeah but it's a stupid necks it doesn't

2306
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,520
make any sense

2307
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:35,920
i mean giraffes are very resourceful

2308
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,920
animals who do incredible things and can

2309
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:39,279
kick a lion why don't you climb the tree

2310
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,319
why don't you climb the tree you don't

2311
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:42,238
need to grow

2312
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:43,599
through the the lengthy evolutionary

2313
01:18:42,238 --> 01:18:46,718
process shooting on giraffes

2314
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,000
i do okay giraffe animals i would very

2315
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:50,960
appreciate that

2316
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:52,800
i take it back i apologize i i trust i

2317
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:55,760
trust your expertise on this

2318
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,960
uh the the the thing that makes humans

2319
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:59,760
really

2320
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,279
fascinating and i think the earth but

2321
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,640
i'm a human

2322
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:07,519
is where we create yeah

2323
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:09,199
we create things that are yes there's

2324
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:11,520
all the ugliness in the world

2325
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:12,639
there's all the on the on the biological

2326
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,600
and the chemical level there's the

2327
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:17,119
pollution

2328
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:20,000
but we create

2329
01:19:17,119 --> 01:19:22,000
beauty if you if you even from a physics

2330
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:24,158
perspective look at symmetry

2331
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:26,079
as somehow capturing beauty the breaking

2332
01:19:24,158 --> 01:19:28,079
of symmetries stuff grounded in all the

2333
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:31,359
different definitions of symmetry

2334
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:34,238
we're good at like creating things

2335
01:19:31,359 --> 01:19:34,238
so as fighters

2336
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:38,000
but not giraffes okay but yes this is a

2337
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:40,000
spider

2338
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,679
yes there are spiders that crystals

2339
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,960
bubbles of air so they can breathe

2340
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:45,199
underwater they can

2341
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,000
literally scuba dive there are spiders

2342
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:48,879
that can create

2343
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,359
parachutes so they can glide and talk

2344
01:19:48,880 --> 01:19:54,159
about symmetry look what spiders can do

2345
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:55,439
and i just thought of spiders but if i

2346
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:57,759
was an alien species

2347
01:19:55,439 --> 01:19:59,839
coming to earth there'll be plenty to

2348
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:03,679
wander and we would just be

2349
01:19:59,840 --> 01:20:06,319
one one of the things yeah clunky

2350
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:07,600
yeah naked monkey yeah the ants might be

2351
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:10,559
even more fascinating

2352
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,199
the ants ants can figure out exactly

2353
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,239
through some

2354
01:20:11,198 --> 01:20:15,759
emergent consciousness what the maximum

2355
01:20:14,238 --> 01:20:19,198
distance between their

2356
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:22,000
trash their babies and their food is

2357
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,759
just from without any of them knowing

2358
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:24,800
how to do this and collectively they've

2359
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,320
learned how to do this

2360
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:28,159
if i was an alien species i'll be

2361
01:20:26,319 --> 01:20:29,279
looking at that well so that was the

2362
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:30,158
other thing i was going to mention the

2363
01:20:29,279 --> 01:20:32,639
second thing

2364
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:33,599
is i tend to believe we can engineer

2365
01:20:32,639 --> 01:20:35,920
consciousness

2366
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,679
but at the at the basic level understand

2367
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:41,440
the source of consciousness

2368
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:42,239
because if consciousness is unique to

2369
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:44,719
humans

2370
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:45,439
and if we can engineer it that gives me

2371
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:46,960
hope that

2372
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:48,399
it could be present elsewhere in the

2373
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,679
universe that's the other thing that

2374
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:52,000
makes

2375
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:53,600
it's an open question that makes humans

2376
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,279
perhaps special

2377
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,199
is not maybe the presence of

2378
01:20:55,279 --> 01:20:59,439
consciousness but some kind

2379
01:20:57,198 --> 01:21:01,039
somehow a presence of like elevated

2380
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:02,960
consciousness it does

2381
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:04,639
again maybe human-centric but it feels

2382
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:06,800
like we're more conscious than giraffes

2383
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:09,039
for example in spiders

2384
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,480
yes i won't deny that i i there is

2385
01:21:09,039 --> 01:21:13,039
something special about humans i

2386
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:14,000
you know they're my favorite species

2387
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:17,039
they are

2388
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,319
they are you know some of my best

2389
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:21,600
friends are humans

2390
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:24,238
and i

2391
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:24,800
i i think highly of humans it's it's

2392
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:28,158
great

2393
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:29,119
i just don't have great hope for our

2394
01:21:28,158 --> 01:21:30,879
longevity

2395
01:21:29,119 --> 01:21:32,399
and specifically i don't have great hope

2396
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:34,000
given that we're the only species that

2397
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:35,599
are five billion that did this cool

2398
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:39,359
consciousness trick

2399
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:42,480
i just i don't want to bet on finding um

2400
01:21:39,359 --> 01:21:43,920
a kinship elsewhere that's quite

2401
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:45,919
interesting to think about

2402
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,600
i don't think i've even considered that

2403
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,760
possibility

2404
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:51,520
that the that there would be life in the

2405
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:54,719
solar system

2406
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,520
so that indicates that very possibly

2407
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:57,119
life is

2408
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:58,719
like literally everywhere yeah

2409
01:21:57,119 --> 01:22:00,880
everywhere it can happen it does

2410
01:21:58,719 --> 01:22:02,800
yeah you know and like especially what

2411
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:03,679
we're discovering with the exoplanets

2412
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,239
now

2413
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:07,600
uh they're how numerous they are or

2414
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:10,879
earth-like

2415
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:12,719
habitable quote-unquote planets there's

2416
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:14,000
like they're everywhere the most common

2417
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,880
type of planet is

2418
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,960
rocky it seems yeah so but i didn't

2419
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:21,359
consider the possibility that life is

2420
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:22,800
like literally everywhere and yet

2421
01:22:21,359 --> 01:22:26,000
intelligent life

2422
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:28,079
is nowhere long enough

2423
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,840
to uh to communicate with each other to

2424
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:32,158
form little clusters

2425
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:35,440
of um civilizations that expand beyond

2426
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:35,439
the solar system and so on

2427
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,079
man maybe becoming a multi-planetary

2428
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,119
species is uh

2429
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:44,719
is a less likely pursuit than um than we

2430
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:46,719
imagined

2431
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,880
but one of the things that makes humans

2432
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:52,639
beautiful is we hope

2433
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:54,800
but i i hope for humanity

2434
01:22:52,639 --> 01:22:56,560
and one of the things i hope for is that

2435
01:22:54,800 --> 01:22:58,960
we become less obsessed

2436
01:22:56,560 --> 01:22:59,840
with conquering and we become less

2437
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:03,439
obsessed

2438
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:06,560
with spreading ourselves

2439
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:08,238
i hope that we transcend that

2440
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,120
that we're happy with the universe

2441
01:23:08,238 --> 01:23:13,839
without having to go and take it

2442
01:23:11,119 --> 01:23:15,920
so you can hope for the species without

2443
01:23:13,840 --> 01:23:19,360
hoping for a multi-planetary

2444
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:22,800
existence that is only

2445
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:24,158
i think the drive of our most primitive

2446
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,760
instincts

2447
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:28,799
to go and take to go and plant a flag

2448
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,520
somewhere we love

2449
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:32,639
planting a flag somewhere and maybe we

2450
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:36,320
could overcome

2451
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:39,679
that minor drive and once we do

2452
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:41,759
the ai systems we build will destroy us

2453
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:43,440
because we're too peaceful and they will

2454
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:45,119
go and conquer and plant the flags

2455
01:23:43,439 --> 01:23:47,678
best of luck to them the cockroaches

2456
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:50,319
will be happy to

2457
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:50,800
keep their keep to the business they

2458
01:23:50,319 --> 01:23:52,559
always have

2459
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,239
i tend to believe that robots can have

2460
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:57,920
the same

2461
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:59,759
uh elegance and consciousness and

2462
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,119
all the qualities of kindness and love

2463
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,679
and hope and fear

2464
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:05,119
that humans have in principle they could

2465
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,520
yes

2466
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:09,679
i don't really trust the people who make

2467
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:09,679
them

2468
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:13,759
this is about the giraffe comment isn't

2469
01:24:12,079 --> 01:24:15,439
it okay

2470
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:17,360
i haven't forgiven you on

2471
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:19,919
giraffes what have they done to you

2472
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:22,158
you um just as a small tangent your

2473
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:23,920
master's thesis is also fascinating

2474
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:25,920
maybe we could talk about it for just a

2475
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:27,920
little bit it's uh titled

2476
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:30,560
influence of a star's evolution on this

2477
01:24:27,920 --> 01:24:32,719
planetary system so

2478
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,800
this interplay between a star and a

2479
01:24:32,719 --> 01:24:36,319
planet is there something interesting

2480
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:37,360
you could say about what you've learned

2481
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:40,559
about this

2482
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:43,439
this journey that star takes

2483
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:45,120
and the planets around it well when i

2484
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:45,839
was younger and i was told what would

2485
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:49,198
happen

2486
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:52,400
ultimately to the earth as the sun

2487
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:54,399
expands towards a red giant and you know

2488
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:57,439
mercury would just like

2489
01:24:54,399 --> 01:25:00,399
fall in and then you know venus

2490
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:02,559
fall in and the sun doesn't care and it

2491
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:05,679
just seemed

2492
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:08,080
so i felt so small

2493
01:25:05,679 --> 01:25:09,199
i felt like the earth and everything on

2494
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:11,198
it it's just

2495
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:13,279
the universe doesn't care even our son

2496
01:25:11,198 --> 01:25:14,319
doesn't care and i think i felt like our

2497
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,319
son should feel some sort of

2498
01:25:14,319 --> 01:25:18,559
responsibility for his parents

2499
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:19,759
you know yeah and it just felt like such

2500
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,320
a violent

2501
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,920
and neglectful parent it's like a parent

2502
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:24,559
eating its own children it's horrible

2503
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,158
it's just a

2504
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:30,159
horrible notion but it made me think

2505
01:25:28,158 --> 01:25:31,359
what if this there's some sort of

2506
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:33,839
generation and so

2507
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:35,359
at the time when i was doing my masters

2508
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:37,520
there was a notion of the white dwarf

2509
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:39,279
cemetery which is this idea that

2510
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:41,120
when stars become white dwarfs that

2511
01:25:39,279 --> 01:25:43,198
death is so horrible

2512
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:44,800
that planets potentially habitable

2513
01:25:43,198 --> 01:25:45,519
planets that could have been habitable

2514
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,600
before

2515
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:49,199
they're now gone there's no there's no

2516
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:51,840
chance for life

2517
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:53,519
but then i thought what if life returns

2518
01:25:51,840 --> 01:25:54,719
you know now it's a white dwarf it's

2519
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:57,600
calmed down it's not going to go

2520
01:25:54,719 --> 01:26:00,000
anywhere white dwarfs are very stable

2521
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,960
across like universal time scales and so

2522
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,198
could you

2523
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,158
have planets around a white dwarf that

2524
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:06,719
could themselves

2525
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:07,759
get life again you know life doesn't

2526
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:12,239
care

2527
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:14,480
and so my work was basically killing

2528
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:16,158
dozens of planets thousands of times i

2529
01:26:14,479 --> 01:26:17,759
just ran

2530
01:26:16,158 --> 01:26:19,839
thousands and thousands of n-body

2531
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:20,159
simulations well you simulated this yeah

2532
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:22,960
so i

2533
01:26:20,158 --> 01:26:23,439
simulated the star wow growing and just

2534
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:25,600
eating

2535
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:26,799
all these planets up and just absolute

2536
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:28,639
chaos and

2537
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,480
the orbits of the planets would change

2538
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:31,520
as the star loses mass so you would have

2539
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:33,599
like

2540
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:34,960
jupiter plant like planets just crashing

2541
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:35,840
into the other planets throwing them

2542
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:39,679
into the sun

2543
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:42,319
early it was terrifying to watch these

2544
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:45,600
simulations it was

2545
01:26:42,319 --> 01:26:47,439
absolute carnage but if you run

2546
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,920
thousands of these simulations

2547
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:50,638
some systems find new balance ways of

2548
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:53,760
staying

2549
01:26:50,639 --> 01:26:57,920
alive some systems

2550
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:59,679
post star death find stable orbits again

2551
01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:01,679
for billions of years more than enough

2552
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:04,880
for life to originate again

2553
01:27:01,679 --> 01:27:08,399
and so that was my idea during that time

2554
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,400
that thesis was trying to explore

2555
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:15,520
this notion of life coming back

2556
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:17,199
and this idea of the universe doesn't

2557
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:18,800
care if you're here or not

2558
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:22,158
and it will go about its business you

2559
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:24,320
know andromeda will crash into us and

2560
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:26,879
doesn't care no one cares if you're

2561
01:27:24,319 --> 01:27:29,519
alive in the universe and so

2562
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:31,199
letting go of that preciousness of life

2563
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:31,760
i found very useful at that stage in my

2564
01:27:31,198 --> 01:27:34,719
career

2565
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:36,159
and instead i just thought what if if

2566
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:38,239
life is inevitable

2567
01:27:36,158 --> 01:27:39,679
it doesn't matter that it came by four

2568
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:41,359
billion years ago it can start again

2569
01:27:39,679 --> 01:27:44,399
four billion years later

2570
01:27:41,359 --> 01:27:46,238
and maybe that is nice maybe that's

2571
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:49,359
where hope lies the

2572
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:50,238
phoenix rising everywhere planets being

2573
01:27:49,359 --> 01:27:53,279
destroyed and

2574
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:56,238
created and we're here now

2575
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:57,439
and others will be more or less here-ish

2576
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:59,678
billions of years later

2577
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:01,439
so accepting the cycle of death and life

2578
01:27:59,679 --> 01:28:03,679
and

2579
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:05,198
uh yeah i'm not taking it personally i'm

2580
01:28:03,679 --> 01:28:06,560
not taking her personally the son

2581
01:28:05,198 --> 01:28:08,799
doesn't owe us anything

2582
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,159
he's not a bad parent it's not a parent

2583
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:13,039
at all

2584
01:28:10,158 --> 01:28:14,879
yeah i was looking at the work of

2585
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:17,920
freeman dyson and

2586
01:28:14,880 --> 01:28:19,359
seeing how it how this universe

2587
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:21,520
eventually will just be a bunch of

2588
01:28:19,359 --> 01:28:23,599
supermassive black holes

2589
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,800
before they also evaporate tiny black

2590
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,360
holes too

2591
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,800
yeah absolutely quiet everyone all the

2592
01:28:27,359 --> 01:28:30,960
black holes a little too far away from

2593
01:28:28,800 --> 01:28:34,400
one another to even interact

2594
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:37,920
until it's just silence forever

2595
01:28:34,399 --> 01:28:38,960
but until then many many cycles of death

2596
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:42,239
and destruction

2597
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:44,000
and rebirth and rebirth

2598
01:28:42,238 --> 01:28:45,919
you kept bringing up sort of coding

2599
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,399
stuff up i just i wanted to ask

2600
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:50,399
uh two things first of all like what

2601
01:28:48,399 --> 01:28:54,000
what programming

2602
01:28:50,399 --> 01:28:57,039
uh language do you like and also

2603
01:28:54,000 --> 01:29:00,479
what um because you're

2604
01:28:57,039 --> 01:29:02,719
as a computational quantum

2605
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:03,519
astrochemist no yes no that's correct

2606
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:07,198
that's right

2607
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:09,679
uh you're kind of um

2608
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:10,960
you could say you're you're actually

2609
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:12,639
understanding some exceptionally

2610
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,158
complicated things

2611
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,920
with one of the things you're using is

2612
01:29:14,158 --> 01:29:18,319
the tools of uh

2613
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:20,319
computation of programming is there a

2614
01:29:18,319 --> 01:29:23,439
device you can give to people

2615
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:25,359
because i i know quite a few that have

2616
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:26,479
not practiced that tool

2617
01:29:25,359 --> 01:29:27,759
and have fallen in love with a

2618
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:29,519
particular science or whatever it's

2619
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,400
biology and chemistry and physics and so

2620
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:33,520
on

2621
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:34,719
and if they were interested in learning

2622
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:37,120
to program

2623
01:29:34,719 --> 01:29:37,760
and learning to use computation is a

2624
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:40,079
tool in there

2625
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:41,920
particular science is there advice you

2626
01:29:40,079 --> 01:29:42,399
can give on programming and also just

2627
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:44,480
maybe

2628
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:46,000
a comment on your own journey and the

2629
01:29:44,479 --> 01:29:49,439
use of

2630
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:50,880
programming in your own life well i'm a

2631
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:52,559
terrible programmer

2632
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,079
a lot of scientists their programming is

2633
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,199
bad because we never learned formal

2634
01:29:54,079 --> 01:29:58,000
programming

2635
01:29:55,198 --> 01:29:58,638
we learned science physics chemistry and

2636
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,880
then

2637
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,159
we were told oh you can you have to get

2638
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,239
these equations modeled

2639
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:05,198
and run through a simulation and you're

2640
01:30:04,238 --> 01:30:07,279
like okay so

2641
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:08,479
i'm gonna learn how to code to do this

2642
01:30:07,279 --> 01:30:10,479
and you learn

2643
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:11,839
just as much as you need to run these

2644
01:30:10,479 --> 01:30:14,319
simulations and no more

2645
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:15,920
so they're rarely optimized and they're

2646
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:17,119
really clunky six months later you can't

2647
01:30:15,920 --> 01:30:18,880
read your own code

2648
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:20,399
my variable names are extremely

2649
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,679
embarrassing i still have

2650
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:26,638
error error messages for different

2651
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:29,520
compilation errors i say things like

2652
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:29,840
at least your dad loves you clara you

2653
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:31,040
know

2654
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:33,600
it doesn't help me at all it's like

2655
01:30:31,039 --> 01:30:34,079
humor yeah yeah just like you suck at

2656
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:36,639
coding

2657
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:37,679
but there's other things in your life so

2658
01:30:36,639 --> 01:30:39,359
i'm a bad programmer

2659
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:40,960
and so you know if that will give hope

2660
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:43,759
to anyone else who's about programmer

2661
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:44,158
i can still do pretty impressive science

2662
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:46,079
yes

2663
01:30:44,158 --> 01:30:48,638
but i learned i think i started learning

2664
01:30:46,079 --> 01:30:51,359
matlab and java when i was in college

2665
01:30:48,639 --> 01:30:52,480
it did me no good at all like it has not

2666
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:54,479
been particularly useful

2667
01:30:52,479 --> 01:30:56,879
i learned some fortran that was very

2668
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:58,799
useful even though it's

2669
01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,079
really not a fun language because so

2670
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:03,679
much of legacy code

2671
01:31:00,079 --> 01:31:06,399
is in fortran and so if you want to use

2672
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:07,440
other people's code who have now retired

2673
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:10,000
fortran will

2674
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:10,960
be nice and then i used idl to visualize

2675
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:12,719
so that

2676
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,639
uh simulation and body simulation those

2677
01:31:12,719 --> 01:31:16,960
all fortran and idl

2678
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:18,560
but thankfully since i've left college

2679
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:20,239
i've just learned python like a

2680
01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,880
normal person and that has been much

2681
01:31:20,238 --> 01:31:25,919
nicer so most of my code now

2682
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:27,840
is in python i should also make a few

2683
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,440
quick comments as well so one is uh

2684
01:31:27,840 --> 01:31:32,400
you say you're sort of bad at

2685
01:31:29,439 --> 01:31:34,158
programming i've

2686
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:35,839
worked with a lot of excellent

2687
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:36,638
scientists that are quote-unquote bad at

2688
01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:39,440
programming

2689
01:31:36,639 --> 01:31:40,560
they're not it gets the job done in fact

2690
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:43,599
there's a

2691
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:44,719
there's a downside to sort of

2692
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:46,880
especially getting a software

2693
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:47,760
engineering education if i were to give

2694
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:49,359
advice

2695
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,960
especially if you're doing a computer

2696
01:31:49,359 --> 01:31:52,238
science degree and you're doing software

2697
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:55,279
engineering

2698
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:58,000
is not to get lost in the

2699
01:31:55,279 --> 01:31:59,519
in the like optimization of the correct

2700
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,880
there's an obsession you can see it in

2701
01:31:59,520 --> 01:32:04,159
like stack overflow

2702
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:07,359
of the correct way to do things and

2703
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:10,479
i think you can too easily get lost

2704
01:32:07,359 --> 01:32:12,000
in uh constantly trying to optimize and

2705
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:13,839
do things the correct way when you

2706
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,479
actually never get done the same thing

2707
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,159
happens you have like

2708
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:19,919
communities of people obsessed with

2709
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:22,238
productivity and they

2710
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:24,158
keep researching productivity hacks and

2711
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:25,759
then they spend like 90 percent

2712
01:32:24,158 --> 01:32:27,759
plus of their time figuring out how to

2713
01:32:25,760 --> 01:32:29,360
do things productively and then never

2714
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,679
actually do anything

2715
01:32:29,359 --> 01:32:33,920
so there's a certain sense if you focus

2716
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:36,079
on the task that needs to be done

2717
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:37,760
that's what programming is for so not

2718
01:32:36,079 --> 01:32:40,000
over optimizing not

2719
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,960
not focus not thinking about variable

2720
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:43,279
names

2721
01:32:40,960 --> 01:32:44,639
uh in this in the following sense

2722
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:46,319
sometimes you think okay i'm going to

2723
01:32:44,639 --> 01:32:49,440
write code that's going to last for

2724
01:32:46,319 --> 01:32:51,039
decades in reality your code

2725
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:53,198
if it's well written or poorly written

2726
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:55,679
will be very likely obsolete

2727
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:56,319
very quickly the point is to get the job

2728
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:58,399
done

2729
01:32:56,319 --> 01:32:59,439
uh really well so there's a trade-off

2730
01:32:58,399 --> 01:33:01,759
there that you

2731
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:03,678
you have to you have to make sure to

2732
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:06,079
strike i should also comment

2733
01:33:03,679 --> 01:33:06,960
as a public service announcement or a

2734
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:09,840
request

2735
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:10,800
if there's any world-class 4chan or

2736
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:12,480
cobalt

2737
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,560
programmers out there i'm looking for

2738
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:16,479
them i want to talk to you

2739
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:18,159
because that will not be me i'm a

2740
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:19,919
terrible foreign programmer

2741
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:21,279
but it's fascinating because so much of

2742
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:24,158
the world in the past

2743
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:26,158
and still runs programming languages and

2744
01:33:24,158 --> 01:33:29,198
there's like no experts on it so

2745
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:29,920
they're all retiring yeah i i disagree

2746
01:33:29,198 --> 01:33:31,519
slightly

2747
01:33:29,920 --> 01:33:33,520
in that i think because i can get the

2748
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:35,040
job done i'm a programmer

2749
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,800
but because no one else can look at my

2750
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,960
code and know how i got my job done

2751
01:33:36,800 --> 01:33:40,159
i'm a bad programmer that's how i'm

2752
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,840
defining it

2753
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:43,519
including yourself including myself six

2754
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:44,480
months later i'm working with a new

2755
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,320
student right now and

2756
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:47,599
she sent me some messages on slack being

2757
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:50,799
like what is this

2758
01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:53,360
um what is this file that you've got um

2759
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,840
with some um functions that run and i

2760
01:33:53,359 --> 01:33:57,519
was like

2761
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:58,719
i i this was from 2018 it wasn't that

2762
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,159
long ago and

2763
01:33:58,719 --> 01:34:02,480
i can no longer remember what that code

2764
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:04,719
does i'm going to spend now two days

2765
01:34:02,479 --> 01:34:06,079
reading through my own code and trying

2766
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:08,480
to improve it

2767
01:34:06,079 --> 01:34:10,000
and i i do think that's frustrating and

2768
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:12,879
so i think my advice to

2769
01:34:10,000 --> 01:34:14,158
any young people who want to get into

2770
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:17,279
astronomy

2771
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:18,158
or astrobiology or quantum chemistry is

2772
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:21,039
that

2773
01:34:18,158 --> 01:34:23,519
i certainly find it much easier to teach

2774
01:34:21,039 --> 01:34:25,840
the science concepts to a programmer

2775
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,520
than the programming to a scientist and

2776
01:34:25,840 --> 01:34:30,079
so i would much

2777
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:30,880
much faster hire someone who knows

2778
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:34,880
programming but

2779
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:37,679
barely knows where space is

2780
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:38,880
than teach programming to an astronomer

2781
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:40,800
oh that's fascinating

2782
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,319
yeah okay this is true i mean yeah

2783
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,560
there's some basics

2784
01:34:42,319 --> 01:34:45,679
i'm uh i'm focusing too much on the

2785
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:47,760
silver lining because i've

2786
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:49,279
the people that write like matlab code

2787
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:50,960
yeah single variable

2788
01:34:49,279 --> 01:34:53,279
single letter variable names so those

2789
01:34:50,960 --> 01:34:53,760
kinds of things it is accessibility

2790
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:56,960
right

2791
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:58,719
it's i want my my code to be open source

2792
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,639
but and it is it's on github anyone can

2793
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,719
download it but is it really open source

2794
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,639
if it's written so cryptically

2795
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:06,079
so poorly that no one can really use it

2796
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:09,279
to his full functionality

2797
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:12,719
have i really published my work

2798
01:35:09,279 --> 01:35:16,719
and that weighs on on me i feel guilty

2799
01:35:12,719 --> 01:35:18,158
for my own inadequacies as a programmer

2800
01:35:16,719 --> 01:35:19,439
you can only do so much it's i've

2801
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:20,238
already learned quantum chemistry and

2802
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:23,439
astrophysics

2803
01:35:20,238 --> 01:35:26,238
so you know uh yeah

2804
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:27,759
i mean there is there's uh there's all

2805
01:35:26,238 --> 01:35:29,599
kinds of ways to contribute to the world

2806
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,239
one of them is publication

2807
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,760
but publishing code is a fascinating way

2808
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:34,959
to contribute to the world even if it's

2809
01:35:33,760 --> 01:35:38,880
very small

2810
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:41,118
very basic element great code

2811
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:42,000
i guess i was also kind of criticizing

2812
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:45,118
the software

2813
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,158
engineering process versus like which is

2814
01:35:45,118 --> 01:35:48,719
a good thing to do

2815
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:50,079
is code that's readable almost like

2816
01:35:48,719 --> 01:35:52,800
without documentation

2817
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:54,719
it's readable it's understandable the

2818
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,600
variable names the structure all those

2819
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:58,560
kinds of things and

2820
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,840
that's the dream that's the dream this

2821
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:02,560
is a dumb question

2822
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:04,639
what do you uh no tell me a dumb

2823
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:07,440
question i want to hear it

2824
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:08,960
okay uh i mean okay this is the question

2825
01:36:07,439 --> 01:36:09,839
about beauty it's way too general it's

2826
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,359
very impossible

2827
01:36:09,840 --> 01:36:13,199
it's like asking what's your favorite

2828
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:14,719
band uh what's your favorite music

2829
01:36:13,198 --> 01:36:15,839
band oh i thought you meant wavelength

2830
01:36:14,719 --> 01:36:16,319
band i was like i definitely have

2831
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:18,960
favorite

2832
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:20,079
my fans absolutely well it's hard to

2833
01:36:18,960 --> 01:36:23,279
narrow down huh

2834
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:24,719
okay uh what uh what to use the most

2835
01:36:23,279 --> 01:36:27,759
beautiful idea

2836
01:36:24,719 --> 01:36:28,880
in science that's not a dumb question

2837
01:36:27,760 --> 01:36:31,760
do you want to try the question again

2838
01:36:28,880 --> 01:36:31,760
proudly okay

2839
01:36:32,399 --> 01:36:35,519
i i have a really good question to ask

2840
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,960
you

2841
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:40,560
okay don't oversell it i've got an okay

2842
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:43,679
question to ask you

2843
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:46,159
ever yeah what

2844
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:46,800
uh what do you is the most beautiful

2845
01:36:46,158 --> 01:36:49,118
idea

2846
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,320
in uh in science something you just find

2847
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:52,719
inspiring or

2848
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:53,920
just maybe the reason you got into

2849
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:59,039
science

2850
01:36:53,920 --> 01:36:59,039
or the reason you think science is cool

2851
01:36:59,840 --> 01:37:05,360
my favorite thing about science is kind

2852
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,920
of the connection between the scales

2853
01:37:05,359 --> 01:37:09,039
so when i was little and i wanted to

2854
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,600
know about space i

2855
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:12,719
really felt that it would make me feel

2856
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:14,719
powerful

2857
01:37:12,719 --> 01:37:17,520
to be able to predict the heavens

2858
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:19,920
something so much larger than myself

2859
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:21,920
that felt really powerful it was almost

2860
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,840
a selfish desire

2861
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:26,719
and that's what i wanted there was some

2862
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:30,319
control to being able to know exactly

2863
01:37:26,719 --> 01:37:33,039
what the sky would do and then as i got

2864
01:37:30,319 --> 01:37:34,559
older and i got more into astronomy and

2865
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:36,079
i didn't just want to know how the stars

2866
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:37,840
moved i wanted to know how the planets

2867
01:37:36,079 --> 01:37:39,760
around them moved and

2868
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,520
and then as i got deeper into that field

2869
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:42,560
i really didn't care that much about the

2870
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,400
planets i want to know about the

2871
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:46,159
atmospheres around the planets and then

2872
01:37:44,399 --> 01:37:48,319
the molecules within those atmospheres

2873
01:37:46,158 --> 01:37:51,519
and what that might mean

2874
01:37:48,319 --> 01:37:52,559
so i ended up shrinking my scale until

2875
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:55,119
it was literally

2876
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:57,039
the quantum scale and now all my work

2877
01:37:55,118 --> 01:38:00,559
the majority of my work is on this

2878
01:37:57,039 --> 01:38:03,679
insane quantum scale and yet

2879
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:07,119
i'm using these literal

2880
01:38:03,679 --> 01:38:10,158
tiny tiny tools to try and answer

2881
01:38:07,118 --> 01:38:12,880
the greatest questions

2882
01:38:10,158 --> 01:38:13,759
that we've ever been able to ask and

2883
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,760
this

2884
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:19,199
crossing of scales from the quantum to

2885
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:22,079
the astronomical

2886
01:38:19,198 --> 01:38:22,879
that's so cool isn't it yeah it spans

2887
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:25,039
the entirety

2888
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,920
the tiny and the huge that's that's the

2889
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:29,118
cool thing about

2890
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:30,719
i guess being a quantum astrochemist

2891
01:38:29,118 --> 01:38:32,238
because you're using the tools of the

2892
01:38:30,719 --> 01:38:34,239
tiny to

2893
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:36,079
look at the heavenly bodies the the

2894
01:38:34,238 --> 01:38:38,399
giant stuff and

2895
01:38:36,079 --> 01:38:40,479
the potential life out there that this

2896
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:42,319
is the thing that connects us

2897
01:38:40,479 --> 01:38:44,000
that you can't escape the rules of the

2898
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:45,920
quantum world and how universal they

2899
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,520
themselves are despite being

2900
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:51,760
probabilistic

2901
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:54,080
and that makes me feel

2902
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:55,920
really pleased to be in science but in a

2903
01:38:54,079 --> 01:38:58,960
really humbling way

2904
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:03,199
it's no longer this thirst for power

2905
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:03,679
and i i feel less special the more work

2906
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:05,599
i do

2907
01:39:03,679 --> 01:39:07,679
less exceptional the more work i do i

2908
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:09,440
feel like humans and the earth

2909
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:10,960
and our place in the universe is less

2910
01:39:09,439 --> 01:39:14,638
and less exceptional

2911
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:16,399
and yet i feel so much less lonely

2912
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:18,319
and so it's been a really good trade-off

2913
01:39:16,399 --> 01:39:20,319
that i've lost power but i've gained

2914
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:21,759
company

2915
01:39:20,319 --> 01:39:23,118
wow that's a beautiful answer i don't

2916
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:24,079
think there's a better way to actually

2917
01:39:23,118 --> 01:39:26,559
end it you're right

2918
01:39:24,079 --> 01:39:27,359
i asked a mediocre question and you came

2919
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:29,840
through uh

2920
01:39:27,359 --> 01:39:32,559
you made the question good by a

2921
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,560
brilliant answer

2922
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,840
um you're the michael jordan and i'm the

2923
01:39:36,238 --> 01:39:39,839
who's the uh dennis rod i'll be the

2924
01:39:37,840 --> 01:39:41,600
dennis rodman hey this is i don't know

2925
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,279
enough about basketball i mean literally

2926
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,760
you've reached the peak of my basketball

2927
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:45,118
knowledge

2928
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:46,880
because i know those people are

2929
01:39:45,118 --> 01:39:48,719
basketball but that's it

2930
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:49,920
pros i believe but only because i watch

2931
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:53,520
space jam i think

2932
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:55,760
are there books or movies in your life

2933
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,119
long ago or recently do you have any

2934
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:00,159
time for books or movies

2935
01:39:57,118 --> 01:40:02,960
had an impact on you uh what ideas

2936
01:40:00,158 --> 01:40:03,279
did you take away i absolutely have time

2937
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:06,639
for

2938
01:40:03,279 --> 01:40:09,759
books and movies i try as best i can

2939
01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:12,719
to not work very hard i mostly fail

2940
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:14,239
i should point out but i think i'm a

2941
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:17,840
better scientist when

2942
01:40:14,238 --> 01:40:20,399
i don't work evenings and weekends i'm

2943
01:40:17,840 --> 01:40:22,159
if i get four good hours in a day i

2944
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:22,719
often don't i often get eight crappy

2945
01:40:22,158 --> 01:40:26,638
hours

2946
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:28,560
you know emails meetings bad code

2947
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:31,199
yes data processing but if i can get

2948
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:33,280
four high quality scientific hours i

2949
01:40:31,198 --> 01:40:35,039
just stopped working for the day

2950
01:40:33,279 --> 01:40:37,279
because i know it's diminishing returns

2951
01:40:35,039 --> 01:40:40,238
after that so i have a lot of time

2952
01:40:37,279 --> 01:40:43,279
i try to make as much time as i can can

2953
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:46,879
you kind of dig into

2954
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:50,000
the what it takes to be one productive

2955
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:52,639
two to be happy in as

2956
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,600
a researcher because i think it's too

2957
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:57,039
easy

2958
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:58,480
in that world to to basic because

2959
01:40:57,039 --> 01:41:00,238
you have so many hats you have to wear

2960
01:40:58,479 --> 01:41:03,439
so many jobs you have to be

2961
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:06,158
a mentor a teacher a head of a

2962
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:06,719
research group do research yourself you

2963
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:08,399
have to do

2964
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:10,800
service all the kinds of stuff you're

2965
01:41:08,399 --> 01:41:14,158
doing now with education and

2966
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:18,560
um interviews

2967
01:41:14,158 --> 01:41:21,279
yeah yeah so as a a public science like

2968
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:22,080
being a public communicator that's a job

2969
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:25,679
yeah

2970
01:41:22,079 --> 01:41:25,679
the the whole thing very poorly

2971
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:34,319
i'll pay you in bitcoin okay i'll take

2972
01:41:31,039 --> 01:41:36,800
uh so uh

2973
01:41:34,319 --> 01:41:37,679
is that is there some advice you can

2974
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:40,320
give to

2975
01:41:37,679 --> 01:41:41,118
to the process of being productive and

2976
01:41:40,319 --> 01:41:44,079
happy

2977
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:45,839
as a researcher i think sadly it's very

2978
01:41:44,079 --> 01:41:47,279
hard to feel happy as a scientist if

2979
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:50,400
you're not productive

2980
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:52,158
it's a bit of a trap um but it's i

2981
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:54,559
certainly find it very difficult to feel

2982
01:41:52,158 --> 01:41:57,039
happy when i'm not being productive

2983
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,639
it's become slightly better if i know my

2984
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:00,960
students are being productive

2985
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:03,039
i can be happy but i think a lot of

2986
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:05,039
senior scientists

2987
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:06,399
once they get into that mindset they

2988
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:07,679
start thinking that their student

2989
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:09,279
science is theirs

2990
01:42:07,679 --> 01:42:10,719
i think this happens a lot of senior

2991
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:13,198
scientists

2992
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:14,560
they have so many hats as you mentioned

2993
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:15,759
they have to do so much service and so

2994
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:17,119
much admin

2995
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:19,440
that they have very little time for

2996
01:42:17,118 --> 01:42:20,158
their own science and so they end up

2997
01:42:19,439 --> 01:42:22,238
feeling

2998
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:24,638
ownership over the junior people in

2999
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:26,238
their labs and their groups and

3000
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:28,719
that's really heartbreaking i see it all

3001
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:31,839
the time and

3002
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:34,719
and that i think i've escaped that trap

3003
01:42:31,840 --> 01:42:35,440
i feel so happy even when i'm not

3004
01:42:34,719 --> 01:42:38,560
productive

3005
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:40,839
when my students are productive i think

3006
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:42,000
that sensation i was describing earlier

3007
01:42:40,840 --> 01:42:44,159
of

3008
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:46,479
they only need to be half as productive

3009
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:50,479
as me for me to feel like

3010
01:42:46,479 --> 01:42:53,759
i've done my job for humanity

3011
01:42:50,479 --> 01:42:54,959
so that has been the dynamic i've had to

3012
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,280
worry about

3013
01:42:54,960 --> 01:42:58,239
but to be productive is not clear to me

3014
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:00,158
what you have to do

3015
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:02,319
you have to not be miserable otherwise i

3016
01:43:00,158 --> 01:43:05,118
find it extremely hard when i'm having

3017
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:06,079
conflicts with um collaborators for

3018
01:43:05,118 --> 01:43:07,759
example

3019
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:09,760
kind of very hard to enjoy the work we

3020
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,880
do even if the work is this you know

3021
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:14,719
fantastical

3022
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:17,840
phosphine or things that i know i love

3023
01:43:14,719 --> 01:43:19,920
still very difficult so i think choosing

3024
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:22,159
your collaborators based on

3025
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,359
how well you get along with them is a

3026
01:43:22,158 --> 01:43:26,799
really sound

3027
01:43:23,359 --> 01:43:27,679
scientific choice having a miserable

3028
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:30,400
collaborator

3029
01:43:27,679 --> 01:43:31,118
ruins your whole life it's horrible it

3030
01:43:30,399 --> 01:43:32,719
makes you not

3031
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:34,799
want to do the science it probably makes

3032
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:35,600
you do clumsy science because you don't

3033
01:43:34,800 --> 01:43:37,440
focus on it

3034
01:43:35,600 --> 01:43:39,360
you don't go over it several times you

3035
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:43,039
just want it to be over

3036
01:43:39,359 --> 01:43:46,319
and so i think in general just

3037
01:43:43,039 --> 01:43:47,600
not being a douche bag can get so much

3038
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:49,599
good science done

3039
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:51,280
just find the good people in your

3040
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:52,639
community and collaborate with them

3041
01:43:51,279 --> 01:43:55,519
even if they're not as good scientists

3042
01:43:52,639 --> 01:43:57,118
as others you'll get better science out

3043
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:59,199
yeah don't be a douchebag yourself and

3044
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:01,920
surround yourself by other cool people

3045
01:43:59,198 --> 01:44:03,039
exactly and then you'll get better

3046
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:05,199
science than if you would

3047
01:44:03,039 --> 01:44:06,158
try to work with three geniuses who are

3048
01:44:05,198 --> 01:44:09,599
just hell

3049
01:44:06,158 --> 01:44:11,279
to be around yeah i mean there's

3050
01:44:09,600 --> 01:44:14,639
parallel things

3051
01:44:11,279 --> 01:44:16,880
like that i'm very fortunate now um

3052
01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:18,159
i was very fortunate at mit to have

3053
01:44:16,880 --> 01:44:20,319
friends and colleagues there

3054
01:44:18,158 --> 01:44:23,198
that were incredible to work with but

3055
01:44:20,319 --> 01:44:26,559
i'm i'm currently sort of

3056
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:31,198
i'm doing a lot of fun stuff on the side

3057
01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:33,360
uh like this little podcast thing and

3058
01:44:31,198 --> 01:44:34,719
i mentioned to you i think robotics

3059
01:44:33,359 --> 01:44:37,279
related stuff

3060
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:38,000
um i was at just the boston dynamics

3061
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:41,039
yesterday

3062
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:44,000
checking out their robots um

3063
01:44:41,039 --> 01:44:45,840
and i'm currently i guess hiring people

3064
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:49,279
to help me with a very fun little

3065
01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:51,600
project around those robots

3066
01:44:49,279 --> 01:44:53,599
i have more applications i can possibly

3067
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:56,639
deal with there's thousands

3068
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:58,000
so uh it's not

3069
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:59,840
it's the opposite it's like we need to

3070
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,520
put an ad out for someone to help you go

3071
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,920
through the application well that too

3072
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:04,960
is already there that over ten thousand

3073
01:45:03,920 --> 01:45:07,279
people apply for that an

3074
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:08,000
infinite matriarchal dollar of uh

3075
01:45:07,279 --> 01:45:10,238
application

3076
01:45:08,000 --> 01:45:11,198
yeah exactly punishment but the point is

3077
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:14,559
it's not

3078
01:45:11,198 --> 01:45:16,799
it's not exactly the point is

3079
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:19,119
like what i'm very distinctly aware of

3080
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:23,520
is life is short

3081
01:45:19,118 --> 01:45:23,519
and productivity

3082
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:27,440
is not the right goal to optimize for at

3083
01:45:25,439 --> 01:45:30,399
least for me the right goal to optimize

3084
01:45:27,439 --> 01:45:32,559
for is how happy you are

3085
01:45:30,399 --> 01:45:33,839
to wake up in the day and to work with

3086
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:35,360
the people that you do

3087
01:45:33,840 --> 01:45:37,039
because the productivity will take care

3088
01:45:35,359 --> 01:45:40,238
of itself great

3089
01:45:37,039 --> 01:45:43,359
and so like it's so important to select

3090
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:45,279
the people well and i think one of the

3091
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:47,839
challenges with academia as opposed to

3092
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:50,639
sort of the thing i'm currently doing is

3093
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:51,520
like saying goodbye sometimes a little

3094
01:45:50,639 --> 01:45:53,039
bit tougher

3095
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,960
because it's really tough your

3096
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:58,158
colleagues are there

3097
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:59,920
oh i mean they're goodbye hurts

3098
01:45:58,158 --> 01:46:01,439
and then if you have to spend the rest

3099
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,719
you know for many years to come

3100
01:46:01,439 --> 01:46:05,039
still surrounded by them in the

3101
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:08,158
community it's tougher it kind of

3102
01:46:05,039 --> 01:46:09,359
adds puts extra pressure to stay in that

3103
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:11,359
relationship

3104
01:46:09,359 --> 01:46:13,039
uh in that collaborative you know in

3105
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:15,519
that collaboration

3106
01:46:13,039 --> 01:46:16,960
and in some sense that makes it much

3107
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,719
more difficult but it's still worth it

3108
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:22,399
it's still worth it to break

3109
01:46:18,719 --> 01:46:24,639
uh ties if if you don't

3110
01:46:22,399 --> 01:46:26,000
if you're not happy if there's not that

3111
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:29,760
magic that dance

3112
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:32,079
i talked to um this guy

3113
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:34,480
named daniel kahneman oh i know danny

3114
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:37,439
kahneman danny yeah

3115
01:46:34,479 --> 01:46:40,559
boy did that guy make me realize like

3116
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:43,519
what a great collaborator is well he had

3117
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:44,080
tversky right yeah but so they had

3118
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,679
obviously

3119
01:46:44,079 --> 01:46:47,118
they had a really deep collaboration

3120
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:49,199
there but like

3121
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:50,479
i collaborated with him on a

3122
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:52,319
conversation

3123
01:46:50,479 --> 01:46:53,599
like just like talking about i don't

3124
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:55,960
know what we were talking about

3125
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:58,000
i think cars autonomous vehicles but the

3126
01:46:55,960 --> 01:47:00,158
brainstorming session

3127
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:02,158
i'm like a nobody and the fact that he

3128
01:47:00,158 --> 01:47:04,399
would with that childlike curiosity

3129
01:47:02,158 --> 01:47:05,519
and that dance of thoughts and ideas and

3130
01:47:04,399 --> 01:47:08,479
the push and pull

3131
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:08,800
and the like and the lack of ego but

3132
01:47:08,479 --> 01:47:10,158
then

3133
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:11,920
enough ego to have a little bit of a

3134
01:47:10,158 --> 01:47:12,799
stubbornness over an idea and a little

3135
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,440
bit of humor

3136
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,400
and all those things it's like holy

3137
01:47:15,439 --> 01:47:18,399
that person

3138
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:19,519
also the ability to truly listen to

3139
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:21,759
another human

3140
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,280
it's like okay that's what it takes to

3141
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,440
be a good collaborator

3142
01:47:23,279 --> 01:47:27,279
if that makes me realize that i haven't

3143
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:28,319
been i've been very fortunate to have

3144
01:47:27,279 --> 01:47:31,519
cool people in my life

3145
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:32,799
but there's like levels even to the cool

3146
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,880
yeah i don't think you can compete with

3147
01:47:32,800 --> 01:47:38,239
danny kahneman on cole he's

3148
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:40,000
just incredible but he was like okay

3149
01:47:38,238 --> 01:47:41,439
i guess i what i'm trying to say is that

3150
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,359
collaboration is an

3151
01:47:41,439 --> 01:47:45,678
art form but perhaps it's actually a

3152
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:48,000
skill it's allowing yourself

3153
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:49,760
uh to develop that skill because that's

3154
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:52,158
one of the fruitful skills

3155
01:47:49,760 --> 01:47:54,320
and and praise it in students you know

3156
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:57,679
and i think it is something you can

3157
01:47:54,319 --> 01:47:58,479
really improve on i've become a better

3158
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:00,079
collaborator

3159
01:47:58,479 --> 01:48:02,718
as the years have gone on i don't have

3160
01:48:00,079 --> 01:48:04,158
some innate collaborative

3161
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:06,399
skills i think their skills i've

3162
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:08,559
developed and i think in science there's

3163
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:11,118
this

3164
01:48:08,560 --> 01:48:11,840
really destructive notion of the lone

3165
01:48:11,118 --> 01:48:13,679
wolf

3166
01:48:11,840 --> 01:48:15,520
the scientists who sees things where

3167
01:48:13,679 --> 01:48:17,600
others don't you know then that's

3168
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:19,280
really appealing and people really like

3169
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,960
either fulfilling that or pretending to

3170
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:25,279
be fulfilling that

3171
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:26,880
and first of all is mostly a lie

3172
01:48:25,279 --> 01:48:28,960
any modern scientist particularly in

3173
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:30,800
astronomy which is so interdisciplinary

3174
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:32,719
any modern sciences do scientist says

3175
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:33,520
doing it on their own is doing a crappy

3176
01:48:32,719 --> 01:48:36,319
job

3177
01:48:33,520 --> 01:48:38,400
most likely because you need an

3178
01:48:36,319 --> 01:48:40,238
independent set of eyes to help you

3179
01:48:38,399 --> 01:48:41,439
do things you need experts in the sub

3180
01:48:40,238 --> 01:48:44,399
fields that you're working on

3181
01:48:41,439 --> 01:48:45,039
to to check your work but most

3182
01:48:44,399 --> 01:48:49,759
importantly

3183
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:52,399
it's just a bad idea it's not um

3184
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:54,079
it doesn't lead to good science and it

3185
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:56,879
leaves you miserable

3186
01:48:54,079 --> 01:48:58,079
i was recently had some work that i was

3187
01:48:56,880 --> 01:48:59,600
avoiding and i thought

3188
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:01,439
maybe i should pursue the scientific

3189
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:02,960
project because i don't

3190
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:04,638
care enough about the outcome and it's

3191
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:06,158
going to be a lot of hard work and i was

3192
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:08,159
trying to balance these two things

3193
01:49:06,158 --> 01:49:09,839
to be really difficult and the outcome

3194
01:49:08,158 --> 01:49:12,158
is that maybe 10 people will cite me in

3195
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:13,840
the next decade because it's not

3196
01:49:12,158 --> 01:49:15,920
no one's asking for this question to be

3197
01:49:13,840 --> 01:49:18,719
answered

3198
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,279
and then i found myself working with

3199
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:21,520
this

3200
01:49:19,279 --> 01:49:22,559
collaborator jason dipman and i spent a

3201
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:25,040
whole afternoon

3202
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:27,199
hours with him working on this and time

3203
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:30,719
flew by and

3204
01:49:27,198 --> 01:49:31,919
and i just felt taller and like i could

3205
01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:34,158
breathe better

3206
01:49:31,920 --> 01:49:35,039
i was happier i was a better person when

3207
01:49:34,158 --> 01:49:37,519
it was done

3208
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:38,560
and that's because he's a great

3209
01:49:37,520 --> 01:49:41,280
collaborator

3210
01:49:38,560 --> 01:49:41,679
he's just a wonderful person that brings

3211
01:49:41,279 --> 01:49:43,439
out

3212
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:45,199
joy out of science that you're doing

3213
01:49:43,439 --> 01:49:47,279
with them

3214
01:49:45,198 --> 01:49:49,039
and that's really the trick you find the

3215
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:51,840
people that make you feel that way about

3216
01:49:49,039 --> 01:49:54,399
the science you're doing and

3217
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,440
and you stop worrying about being the

3218
01:49:54,399 --> 01:49:57,359
lone wolf

3219
01:49:55,439 --> 01:49:58,479
that's just a terrible dream that will

3220
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:02,238
leave you miserable and

3221
01:49:58,479 --> 01:50:04,319
your signs will be and uh

3222
01:50:02,238 --> 01:50:05,839
since i'm russian just murder anybody

3223
01:50:04,319 --> 01:50:08,840
who who doesn't

3224
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:10,159
fall into that beautiful collaborative

3225
01:50:08,840 --> 01:50:13,279
relationship

3226
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:15,279
we were talking about books books yes

3227
01:50:13,279 --> 01:50:16,319
is there books why was i talking about

3228
01:50:15,279 --> 01:50:18,079
my productivity

3229
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,759
oh you said i you maybe don't have time

3230
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:20,639
for books and movies and you said you

3231
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:23,199
must

3232
01:50:20,639 --> 01:50:24,400
make time for books and movies make time

3233
01:50:23,198 --> 01:50:25,839
to not work

3234
01:50:24,399 --> 01:50:27,519
make time to not work whatever that

3235
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:31,119
looks like to you

3236
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:34,080
um but there's plenty i

3237
01:50:31,118 --> 01:50:36,000
when i was younger i found a lot of kind

3238
01:50:34,079 --> 01:50:36,800
of my scientific fulfillment in books

3239
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:39,439
and movies

3240
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:40,320
now as i got older i have plenty of that

3241
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:43,759
in my work

3242
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:47,359
and i try to read outside my field i

3243
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:50,000
read about danny kahneman's work instead

3244
01:50:47,359 --> 01:50:50,399
but when i was little it was contact the

3245
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:53,439
book

3246
01:50:50,399 --> 01:50:57,439
the carl sagan book i

3247
01:50:53,439 --> 01:51:00,479
really thought i was just like ellie

3248
01:50:57,439 --> 01:51:02,638
um and i was going to become ali i

3249
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:03,678
really resonated with me that character

3250
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:05,679
and

3251
01:51:03,679 --> 01:51:06,880
the notions of life and space in the

3252
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:11,199
universe

3253
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:13,599
even the idea of then the the movie

3254
01:51:11,198 --> 01:51:14,719
came out and i got to put you know jodie

3255
01:51:13,599 --> 01:51:17,920
foster in that

3256
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:20,319
um which helped but

3257
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,039
you know even the notion of if it is

3258
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:23,279
just us

3259
01:51:21,039 --> 01:51:25,760
what an awful waste of space i find

3260
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:28,319
extremely useful as a concept to think

3261
01:51:25,760 --> 01:51:29,440
you know maybe we are special but that

3262
01:51:28,319 --> 01:51:31,198
would suck

3263
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:32,559
is a really nice way of thinking of the

3264
01:51:31,198 --> 01:51:35,198
search for life

3265
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:36,800
that it's much better to not be special

3266
01:51:35,198 --> 01:51:40,000
and have company

3267
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:41,920
i got that from carl sagan so that's

3268
01:51:40,000 --> 01:51:45,760
what i always recommend

3269
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:48,960
let me ask one other ridiculous question

3270
01:51:45,760 --> 01:51:52,000
we talked about the death

3271
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:53,520
and life cycle that is ever present in

3272
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,359
the universe until it's not

3273
01:51:53,520 --> 01:51:56,960
until it's super massive and little

3274
01:51:55,359 --> 01:51:58,559
black holes too at the end of the

3275
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:01,840
universe

3276
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:03,760
what do you think is the why the

3277
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,880
meaning of it all what do you think is

3278
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,320
the meaning

3279
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:09,118
of life here on earth and the meaning of

3280
01:52:08,319 --> 01:52:11,439
that

3281
01:52:09,118 --> 01:52:12,559
life that you look for whether it's on

3282
01:52:11,439 --> 01:52:16,319
venus or other

3283
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:17,520
exoplanets i think there's none i find

3284
01:52:16,319 --> 01:52:19,920
enormous relief

3285
01:52:17,520 --> 01:52:22,320
in the absence of meaning i think

3286
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:25,440
chasing for meaning is

3287
01:52:22,319 --> 01:52:28,238
a human desire the universe doesn't give

3288
01:52:25,439 --> 01:52:28,238
two shits about

3289
01:52:29,039 --> 01:52:33,279
but you still enjoy i enjoy finding

3290
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:36,400
meaning in my life

3291
01:52:33,279 --> 01:52:39,439
i enjoy finding

3292
01:52:36,399 --> 01:52:40,399
where the morality lies i enjoy the

3293
01:52:39,439 --> 01:52:43,598
complication

3294
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:46,719
of that desire

3295
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:49,599
and i feel that is deeply human

3296
01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:52,000
but i don't feel that it's universal

3297
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:55,599
it's somehow absolute like we conjure it

3298
01:52:52,000 --> 01:52:56,960
up we we bring it to life through our

3299
01:52:55,599 --> 01:53:00,800
own minds but it's not

3300
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:03,599
any kind of fundamental way real no

3301
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:05,679
and the same way the sun is not to be

3302
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:09,520
blamed for destroying

3303
01:53:05,679 --> 01:53:12,399
its own planets the universe

3304
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:14,080
doesn't care because it has no meaning

3305
01:53:12,399 --> 01:53:16,000
it always is nothing

3306
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:17,920
and looking for meaning in the universe

3307
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,238
is demanding answers

3308
01:53:17,920 --> 01:53:21,440
who are we we're nothing we don't get to

3309
01:53:20,238 --> 01:53:23,759
demand anything

3310
01:53:21,439 --> 01:53:25,198
and that includes meaning and i find it

3311
01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,840
very reassuring

3312
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:28,969
because once there is no meaning i don't

3313
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:31,039
have to find it

3314
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:34,079
[Laughter]

3315
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:36,399
uh yeah

3316
01:53:34,079 --> 01:53:38,079
once there's no meaning it's a kind of

3317
01:53:36,399 --> 01:53:39,409
freedom in a way

3318
01:53:38,079 --> 01:53:41,198
you sound a bit like um

3319
01:53:39,409 --> 01:53:42,319
[Music]

3320
01:53:41,198 --> 01:53:43,598
i'm happy about it this isn't a

3321
01:53:42,319 --> 01:53:46,158
depressing outlook as far as i'm

3322
01:53:43,599 --> 01:53:47,599
concerned it's happiness yeah yeah so

3323
01:53:46,158 --> 01:53:49,759
i mean there's a i don't know if you

3324
01:53:47,599 --> 01:53:52,880
know who sam harris is but he

3325
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:55,199
uh despite the pushbacks from

3326
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:56,079
the entirety of the world really argues

3327
01:53:55,198 --> 01:53:59,359
hard that there's

3328
01:53:56,079 --> 01:54:00,880
that free will is an illusion that um

3329
01:53:59,359 --> 01:54:02,639
you know the the

3330
01:54:00,880 --> 01:54:05,118
the deterministic universe and it's

3331
01:54:02,639 --> 01:54:07,599
already been predetermined and

3332
01:54:05,118 --> 01:54:09,439
and he's okay with it and he's happy

3333
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:11,840
with it that that

3334
01:54:09,439 --> 01:54:13,519
he's distinctly aware of it and that's

3335
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:16,159
one of the moral will disagree with him

3336
01:54:13,520 --> 01:54:18,960
on the deterministic nature of

3337
01:54:16,158 --> 01:54:20,638
nature well he's uh it's not the he's

3338
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:21,359
not saying it's deterministic but he's

3339
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:24,319
saying that the

3340
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:25,839
randomness doesn't help either like

3341
01:54:24,319 --> 01:54:29,840
randomness does not

3342
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:31,520
help in in the experience of feeling

3343
01:54:29,840 --> 01:54:32,800
like you're the decider of your own

3344
01:54:31,520 --> 01:54:35,679
actions

3345
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:36,079
that he kind of is okay with being a

3346
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:39,118
leaf

3347
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:40,158
flowing on the river like or being the

3348
01:54:39,118 --> 01:54:42,079
river

3349
01:54:40,158 --> 01:54:44,399
right as opposed to having or being like

3350
01:54:42,079 --> 01:54:47,359
a fish or something that can decide it's

3351
01:54:44,399 --> 01:54:48,879
swimming direction he's okay just

3352
01:54:47,359 --> 01:54:50,158
embracing the flow of life i mean in

3353
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:52,400
that same way

3354
01:54:50,158 --> 01:54:53,439
it kind of sounds like your conception

3355
01:54:52,399 --> 01:54:56,719
of

3356
01:54:53,439 --> 01:54:59,359
meaning i mean it just is it doesn't

3357
01:54:56,719 --> 01:55:01,118
the universe doesn't care it just is

3358
01:54:59,359 --> 01:55:01,839
what it is and we experience certain

3359
01:55:01,118 --> 01:55:07,039
things

3360
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:07,039
and some feel good and some don't and uh

3361
01:55:07,118 --> 01:55:11,039
that's life but i don't feel like that

3362
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:11,519
about life i think life does have

3363
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:14,000
meaning

3364
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:16,159
and there's and it's laudable to look

3365
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,880
for that meaning in life

3366
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:20,000
i just don't think you can apply that

3367
01:55:18,880 --> 01:55:23,279
beyond life

3368
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:25,359
and certainly not be on earth that this

3369
01:55:23,279 --> 01:55:26,479
notion of meaning is a human construct

3370
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:30,238
and so

3371
01:55:26,479 --> 01:55:34,079
it only applies within us and

3372
01:55:30,238 --> 01:55:37,439
the other life forms and planet

3373
01:55:34,079 --> 01:55:41,519
types that suffer from our intrusions or

3374
01:55:37,439 --> 01:55:43,919
rejoice from our interactions but

3375
01:55:41,520 --> 01:55:44,639
it's this this meaning is ours to do as

3376
01:55:43,920 --> 01:55:46,800
we please

3377
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:47,840
we created it we've created a need for

3378
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:49,760
it and so

3379
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:51,119
that's our problem to solve i don't

3380
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:52,560
apply it beyond us

3381
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:54,079
i think we as humans have a lot of

3382
01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:55,440
responsibilities but they're moral

3383
01:55:54,079 --> 01:55:56,880
responsibilities

3384
01:55:55,439 --> 01:55:58,719
and a lot of the responsibilities are

3385
01:55:56,880 --> 01:56:01,039
much more easily fulfilled

3386
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:02,560
if you find meaning in them so i think

3387
01:56:01,039 --> 01:56:05,920
there's value to meaning

3388
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:06,239
whether it's real or not i just think we

3389
01:56:05,920 --> 01:56:09,118
gain

3390
01:56:06,238 --> 01:56:10,799
nothing from trying to anthropomorphize

3391
01:56:09,118 --> 01:56:13,519
the entire universe

3392
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:15,440
and also that's the height of hubris

3393
01:56:13,520 --> 01:56:18,400
that's not for us to do

3394
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:19,519
yeah it also could be just like duality

3395
01:56:18,399 --> 01:56:22,799
and quantum mechanics

3396
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:23,679
it could uh it could be both that there

3397
01:56:22,800 --> 01:56:26,560
is meaning

3398
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:27,679
and then there isn't and we're somehow

3399
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:31,039
depending on

3400
01:56:27,679 --> 01:56:33,279
the observer depending on the

3401
01:56:31,039 --> 01:56:34,399
the perspective you take on the thing i

3402
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:37,359
mean even on

3403
01:56:34,399 --> 01:56:38,719
earth that's true but the whether things

3404
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:41,279
are meaning or not depends a lot on

3405
01:56:38,719 --> 01:56:43,679
who's looking

3406
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:46,079
whether it's us humans the aliens or the

3407
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:49,840
giraffes

3408
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:52,800
clara this was a incredible conversation

3409
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:55,679

am just inspired by the passion you have

3411
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:59,359
in um not finding meaning in the

3412
01:56:57,599 --> 01:57:01,520
universe yeah right

3413
01:56:59,359 --> 01:57:04,000
for someone i'm very passionate about

3414
01:57:01,520 --> 01:57:06,080
not finding meaning in the universe

you're the most inspiring nihilist i've

3416
01:57:06,079 --> 01:57:10,559
ever met i'm just kidding

3417
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:13,360

01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:19,439
everything from phosphine to

3420
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:21,199
life to quantum astro chemistry i can't

3421
01:57:19,439 --> 01:57:21,839
wait to see what other cool things you

3422
01:57:21,198 --> 01:57:23,678

the earth is the cradle of humanity but

3441
01:57:56,800 --> 01:58:00,079
mankind cannot stay in the cradle
