00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,480
matt walker sleep scientist professor of

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,559
neuroscience and psychology at berkeley

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,960
author of why we sleep and the host of a

5
00:00:10,558 --> 00:00:14,160
new podcast called the matt walker

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,000
podcast

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,800
it's 10 minute episodes a couple of

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,640
times a month covering sleep and other

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,719
health and science topics

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,359
i love it and recommend it highly it's

11
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,278
up there with the greats like the

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,599
hubermann lab podcast with andrew

13
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:32,320
huberman and i think david sinclair is

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,238
putting out an audio series soon too i

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,880
can't wait to listen to it i'm really

16
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:38,479
excited by the future of science in the

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
podcasting world

18

their links are in the description

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,799
as a side note let me say that to me a

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,558
healthy life is one in which you fall in

24
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,479
love with the world around you with

25
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,718
ideas with people

26
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:03,599
with small goals and big goals no matter

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,680
how difficult with dreams you hold on to

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,840
and chase for years

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,560
life should be lived fully

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,280
that to me is the priority that to me is

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,600
a healthy life second to that is the

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,478
understanding and the utilization of the

33
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,599
best available science on diet exercise

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:23,280
supplements

35
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:25,679
sleep and other lifestyle choices to me

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,478
science in the realm of health is a

37
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,799
guide for we should try not the absolute

38
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,319
truth of how to live life

39
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,560
the goal is to learn to listen to your

40
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:35,679
body and figure out what works best for

41
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,320
you

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,560
all that said a good night's sleep can

43
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:42,959
be a great tool in making life awesome

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,799
and productive and matt is a great

45
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:48,879
advocate of the how and the why of sleep

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,360
we agree on some things and disagree on

47
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,679
others but he's a great human being a

48
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:54,399
great scientist and as of recently a

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,479
friend

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,560
with whom i enjoy having these wide

51
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,879
ranging conversations

52
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,960
this is the lex friedman podcast and

53
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:06,640
here is my conversation with matt walker

54
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:09,840
you should try these shades on and see

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,840
what you look like

56
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,878
so they are now your shades

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,040
and that's not the question it's the

58
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:18,599
same thing as uh putin took the super

59
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:20,799
bowl ring and it's now his ring

60
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,560
[Laughter]

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,040
yeah one wonders if he was offered it

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,318
but um they are yours

63
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,000
[Laughter]

64
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,039
when did you first

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,840
fall in love with the

66
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:35,759
dream of understanding sleep like

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,080
where did the fascination with sleep

68
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,079
begin

69
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,439
so

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,080
back in the united kingdom you can sort

71
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,359
of start doing medicine at age 18 and

72
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,480
it's a five-year program and i was at

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,440
the queen's medical center in the uk

74
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,359
and i remember just being fascinated by

75
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,959
states of consciousness and particularly

76
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,319
anesthesia

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,800
i was thinking

78
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:03,199
isn't that within seconds i can take a

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,560
perfectly conscious human being

80
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,759
and i can remove

81
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,640
all existence of the mentality and their

82
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:13,359
awareness within seconds

83
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,518
and that stunned me so i started to get

84
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,959
really interested in conscious states i

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,599
even started to read a lot about

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,239
hypnosis

87
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,399
and all of these things hypnosis

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,319
even sleep and dreams at the time they

89
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,680
were very esoteric it was sort of

90
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:33,119
charlatan science at that stage

91
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,920
and i think almost all of my colleagues

92
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,400
and i are accidental sleep researchers

93
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:40,000
you know no one as i recall in the

94
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,840
classroom when you're sort of five years

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,080
old and the teacher says what would you

96
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
like to be when you grow up you know no

97
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,400
one's putting their hand up and saying i

98
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:51,280
would love to be a sleep researcher

99
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,799
and so when i was doing my phd

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,959
i was trying to

101
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,360
identify different forms of dementia

102
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,199
very early on in the course

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
and i was using electrical brainwave

104
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:05,039
recordings to do that and i was failing

105
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,039
miserably it was a disaster just no

106
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,639
result after no result

107
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,400
and i used to go home to the doctor's

108
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,238
residence with this sort of little igloo

109
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,920
of journals that at the weekend i would

110
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,600
sort of sit in and uh and read and which

111
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,879
i'm now thinking do i really want to

112
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,720
admit this because it sounds like i had

113
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:22,719
no social life which i didn't i'm a

114
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,199
social leper but

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,040
and i started to realize that some parts

116
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,680
of the brain were

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,720
um sleep-related areas and

118
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,240
some dementias were eating away those

119
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,000
sleep-related areas other dementias

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,879
would leave them untouched and i thought

121
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,560
well

122
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:41,120
i'm doing this all wrong i'm measuring

123
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,800
my patients while they're awake

124
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,120
instead i should be measuring them while

125
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,439
they're asleep started doing that got

126
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,840
some amazing results

127
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,600
and then i wanted to ask the question is

128
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,279
that sleep

129
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,520
disruption that my patients are

130
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,758
experiencing as they go into dementia

131
00:04:55,519 --> 00:05:00,159
maybe it's not a symptom of the dementia

132
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,840
i wonder if it's a cause of

133
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,479
the dementia

134
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:07,758
and at that point which was

135
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:09,599
kafka 20 years ago um

136
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,199
no one could answer a very simple

137
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,879
fundamental question why do we sleep

138
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,199
and

139
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:18,719
i at the time didn't realize that some

140
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,720
of the most brilliant minds in

141
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
scientific history had tried to answer

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
that question and failed

143
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,159
and at that point i just thought well

144
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:29,120
i'm going to go and do a couple of years

145
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,960
of sleep research and i'll figure out

146
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,519
why we sleep and then i'll come back to

147
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,359
my patients in this question of dementia

148
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:38,478
and as i said that was 20 years ago and

149
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:41,360
what i realized is that hard questions

150
00:05:38,478 --> 00:05:43,279
occur very little about who asks them

151
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,759
they will meter out their lessons of

152
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,038
difficulty all the same and i was

153
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,120
schooled

154
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,560
in the difficulty of the question why do

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,439
we sleep

156
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,199
but in truth 20 years later we've had to

157
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:57,199
upend the question

158
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,240
rather than saying why do we sleep and

159
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,439
by the way the answer then was that we

160
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,199
sleep to cure sleepiness

161
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,279
which is like saying all right you know

162
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,800
we eat to cure hunger yeah that tells

163
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,519
you nothing about the physiological

164
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,520
benefits of food same with sleep

165
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,918
now we've actually have to ask the

166
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,918
question is there any physiological

167
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:20,079
system in the body or any major

168
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,159
operation of the mind that isn't

169
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:24,079
wonderfully enhanced when we get sleep

170
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,439
or demonstrably impaired when we don't

171
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,758
get enough

172
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,918
and so far for the most part the answer

173
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,879
seems to be now

174
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:35,439
so far the answer seems to be no

175
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,159
so why

176
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:41,199
why does the body and the mind

177
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,639
crave sleep then why do we sleep

178
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,560
how you know

179
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,759
can we begin to answer that question

180
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,600
then

181
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,960
so i think one of the ways that i think

182
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,840
about this or

183
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,839
one of the answers that came to me

184
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,719
is the following the reason that we

185
00:06:53,839 --> 00:06:59,439
implode so quickly and so thoroughly

186
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,680
with insufficient sleep is because human

187
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,038
beings seem to be one of the few species

188
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,120
that will deliberately deprive

189
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,598
themselves of sleep for no apparent good

190
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,639
reason biological

191
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:12,159
and what that led me then to was the

192
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,120
following

193
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,759
mother nature as a consequence so no

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,079
other species does what we do in that

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,800
context there are a few species that do

196
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,758
undergo sleep deprivation but for very

197
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,199
obvious clear biological reasons one is

198
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,000
when they're in a condition of severe

199
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,080
starvation the second is when they're

200
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,918
caring for their newborn so for example

201
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:36,399
killer whales will often deprive

202
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:37,439
themselves the female will go away from

203
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,239
the pod

204
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,319
give birth and then bring the calf back

205
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,400
and during that time the mother will

206
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,240
undergo sleep deprivation

207
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:48,918
and then the the third one is during

208
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,079
migration when birds are flying trans

209
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:54,079
oceanographic to 3 000 miles but for the

210
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,359
most part it's never seen in the animal

211
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,598
kingdom

212
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,840
which brings me back to the point

213
00:07:57,598 --> 00:08:02,240
therefore mother nature

214
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,918
in the course of evolution has never had

215
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,319
to face the challenge of this thing

216
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:09,279
called sleep deprivation

217
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,680
and therefore she has never created a

218
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:12,679
safety net in place

219
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,759
to

220
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,879
circumnavigate this common influence

221
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,879
and

222
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,599
there's a good example where we have

223
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,800
which is called the adipose cell the fat

224
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,120
cell

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,680
because during our evolutionary past we

226
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,598
had famine and we had feast and mother

227
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,800
nature came up with a very clever recipe

228
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:33,439
which is

229
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,000
how can i store caloric

230
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,399
credit so that i can spend it when i go

231
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,719
into debt and the fat cell was born

232
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,000
brilliant idea where is the fat cell for

233
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,919
sleep

234
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,080
where is that sort of banking chip for

235
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:48,319
sleeping unfortunately we don't seem to

236
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,800
have one because she's never had to face

237
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,560
that challenge so even if there's not

238
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,278
some kind of physics

239
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:57,278
fundamental need for sleep

240
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,000
that uh physiologically or

241
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:03,039
psychologically the the fact is most

242
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,519
organisms are built such that they need

243
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,480
it and then mother nature

244
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,278
never built an extra mechanism for sleep

245
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,800
deprivation so it's interesting that

246
00:09:11,278 --> 00:09:17,759
why we sleep by not have a good answer

247
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,159
but we need to sleep to be healthy

248
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,399
is nevertheless true yeah and we have

249
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,559
many answers right now in some ways the

250
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,839
question of why we sleep was the wrong

251
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,958
question too

252
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,640
it's you know what are the pluripotent

253
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,399
many reasons we sleep we don't just

254
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,439
sleep for one reason

255
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,720
because

256
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,640
from an evolutionary perspective it is

257
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,240
the most idiotic thing that you could

258
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:42,159
imagine yeah you know when you're

259
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,759
sleeping you're not

260
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:45,519
finding a mate you're not reproducing

261
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,240
you're not caring for your young you're

262
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,480
not foraging for food and worse still

263
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,639
you're vulnerable to predation

264
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,639
so on any one of those grounds

265
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,559
especially as a collective

266
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,679
sleep should have been strongly selected

267
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:02,399
against in the course of evolution

268
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,599
but in every species that we've studied

269
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,000
carefully to date sleep is present

270
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,759
yeah so it is important so like

271
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,600
you're right i think i've heard

272
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:13,838
arguments from an evolutionary biology

273
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,278
perspective that sleep is actually

274
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,720
advantageous

275
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:18,240
you know maybe like some kind of

276
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,480
predator predator-prey relationships

277
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,399
yeah but you're saying it actually makes

278
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,959
way more sense what you're saying

279
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,200
is it should have been selected against

280
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,599
like why close your eyes

281
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,000
yeah why because and you know there was

282
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
an energy conservation hypothesis for a

283
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,839
while which is that we need to

284
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,680
essentially go into low battery mode you

285
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,399
know power down because it's

286
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:42,319
unsustainable but in fact that actually

287
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:45,600
has been blasted out the water because

288
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:47,360
sleep is an incredibly active process in

289
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,759
fact the difference between you just

290
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,680
lying on the couch but remaining

291
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:53,838
conscious versus you lying on the couch

292
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:57,278
and falling asleep it's only a savings

293
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,959
of about 140 150 calories in other words

294
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,120
you know you just go out and club

295
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:02,799
another baby seal or whatever it was and

296
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
you wouldn't worry you know so it has to

297
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:06,240
be much more to it than energy

298
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,959
conservation much more to it than

299
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,278
sharing you know ecosystem space and

300
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:13,518
time much more to it than simply

301
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:15,759
predator prey relationships

302
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:18,159
if sleep really did and

303
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,639
you know looking back even very old

304
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:23,838
evolutionary organisms like earthworms

305
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:25,199
millions of years old they have periods

306
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,720
where they're active in periods where

307
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,560
they're passively asleep it's called

308
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,600
lethargics

309
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:30,639
and so

310
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,879
what that

311
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:35,439
in some way suggested to me was

312
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,919
sleep evolved with life itself on it

313
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,560
this planet and then it has fought its

314
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:42,479
way through heroically every step along

315
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:44,399
the evolutionary pathway

316
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,639
which then leads to the

317
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:48,720
sort of famous um sleep statement from a

318
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,958
researcher that if sleep doesn't serve

319
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,959
an absolutely vital function or

320
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:55,199
functions then it's the biggest mistake

321
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,638
the evolutionary process has ever ever

322
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,720
made and we've now realized mother

323
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,000
nature didn't make a spectacular blender

324
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,440
with sleep

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,039
you've mentioned the idea of conscious

326
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,000
states

327
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,240
do you think of sleep as a fundamentally

328
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,958
different conscious state than

329
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,120
awake awakenness

330
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:16,000
and how many conscious states are there

331
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:18,320
so when you're intuit your understanding

332
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,958
of what the mind can do do you think

333
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,639
awake state sleep state or is there some

334
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,879
kind of continuum

335
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,120
there's a complicated state transition

336
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,399
diagram like how do you think about this

337
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,879
whole space

338
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:33,039
i think about it as a state space

339
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:35,679
diagram and i think it's probably more

340
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,519
of a continuum than we have

341
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,039
believed it to be or suggested it to be

342
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,679
so we used to think

343
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,519
absent of anesthesia that there were

344
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,919
really three main main states of

345
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,879
consciousness there was being awake

346
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:51,360
being in non-rapid eye movement sleep or

347
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,360
non-dream sleep and then being in rapid

348
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,680
eye movement sleep or dream sleep and

349
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,200
those were the three states within which

350
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,319
your brain could

351
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:03,920
percolate and be conscious i you know

352
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:06,000
conscious during non-rem sleep is maybe

353
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,319
a stretch to say but i still believe

354
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,360
there is plenty of consciousness there

355
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,920
i don't believe that though anymore

356
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,839
and the reason is because we can have

357
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:19,120
daydreams

358
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,519
and we are in a very different wakeful

359
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,839
state in those day dreams than we are

360
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,240
when we are as we are now together

361
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,839
present and

362
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,799
extraceptively focused rather than

363
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,880
intraceptively focused

364
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:36,399
and then we also know that as you are

365
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,879
sort of progressing into those different

366
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,799
stages of sleep during non-rem sleep you

367
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:43,278
can also still dream depends on your

368
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,359
definition of dreaming but we seem to

369
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:48,480
have some degree of dreaming in almost

370
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,320
all stages of sleep

371
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,839
we've also then found that when you are

372
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,560
sleep deprived

373
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,160
there even individual brain cells will

374
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,559
fall asleep

375
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,879
despite the animal being

376
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,399
you know behaviorally from best we can

377
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,159
tell awake

378
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,039
individual brain cells and clusters of

379
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:09,759
brain cells will go into a sleep-like

380
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:12,000
state and humans do this too when we are

381
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,958
sleep deprived we have what are called

382
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,120
micro sleeps where the eyelid will

383
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:20,479
partially close

384
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:23,919
and the brain essentially falls lapses

385
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,800
into a state of sleep but behaviorally

386
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:28,719
you seem to be awake and the danger here

387
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:29,599
is road traffic accidents

388
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,920
so

389
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,959
these are the what we call these sort of

390
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,559
micro sleep events at the wheel now if

391
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:40,239
you're traveling at

392
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:42,239
65 miles an hour in a two ton vehicle

393
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,839
you know it takes probably around one

394
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,240
second to drift from one lane to the

395
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,000
next and it takes two seconds to go

396
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,759
completely off the road

397
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,759
so if you have one of these micro sleeps

398
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,480
at the wheel you know it could be the

399
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:57,439
last microsleep that you ever have

400
00:14:54,480 --> 00:15:00,879
but i don't now see it as a set of you

401
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,320
know very binary distinct you know step

402
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:07,360
function state it's not a one or a zero

403
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,680
i see it more of a as a continuum yeah

404
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,120
so i've for

405
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:13,519
for uh

406
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,360
five six years at mit

407
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:18,000
really focused on this

408
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,480
human side of driving question and one

409
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,159
of the big concerns is

410
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,560
the

411
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,958
micro sleeps drowsiness these kinds of

412
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:29,198
ideas and one of the open questions was

413
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:32,239
is it possible through computer vision

414
00:15:29,198 --> 00:15:33,919
to detect or any kind of sensors

415
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
the nice thing about computer vision is

416
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,719
you don't have to have direct contact to

417
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,440
the person

418
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,839
is it possible to detect

419
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,600
increases in uh drowsiness is it

420
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:46,320
possible to detect these kind of micro

421
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,120
sleeps or actually just sleep in general

422
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,360
um

423
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,519
among other things like distraction

424
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,440
these are all words that have so many

425
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,759
meanings and so many debates like

426
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,120
like attention is a whole nother one

427
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,159
just because you're looking something

428
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,240
doesn't mean

429
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,639
you're loading in the information just

430
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,320
because you're looking away doesn't mean

431
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:06,159
your peripheral vision can't pick up the

432
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,399
important information there's so many

433
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:10,719
complicated vision science things there

434
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,480
um so i i wonder if you could say

435
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,000
something to

436
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,440
uh you know they say the eyes or the

437
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,120
windows to the soul do you think um

438
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,880
the eyes can reveal

439
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,759
something about uh

440
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,600
sleepiness uh through uh through

441
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,440
computer vision through

442
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,079
just looking at the video of the face

443
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,759
and andrew huberman and i your friend

444
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:33,758
have talked about this so we'd love to

445
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,600
work on this uh together so you should

446
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,519
do it it's a fascinating problem but

447
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,278
drowsiness is a tricky one so there's

448
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,360
what kind of information

449
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,559
there's uh blinking and there's eye

450
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,560
movement

451
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,958
and those are the ones that can be

452
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,559
picked uh up with computer vision do you

453
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:50,479
think those are signals that could be

454
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,359
used to say something about

455
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,639
where we are in this continuum yeah i do

456
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,039
and i think there are a number of other

457
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:00,399
features too i think um you know

458
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:03,039
aperture of i so in other words partial

459
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,279
closures foreclosures

460
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:08,399
duration of those closures duration of

461
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,279
those partial closures of the eyelid

462
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,280
um i think there may be some information

463
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:15,119
in the pupil as well

464
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,279
because as we're transitioning between

465
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,879
those states change there are changes in

466
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:20,720
what's called the automatic nervous

467
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,360
system or technically it's called the

468
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,880
autonomic nervous system part of which

469
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,038
will control your

470
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
pupillary size

471
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,319
so i actually think that there is

472
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,960
probably a wealth of information when

473
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:38,079
you combine that probably with

474
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:39,679
aspects of steering angle steering

475
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,000
maneuver

476
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,400
and if you can sense the pressure

477
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,759
on the pedals as well

478
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,919
my guess is that there is some

479
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,720
combinatorial feature

480
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,000
that creates a phenotype

481
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,038
of

482
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,160
you are starting to fall asleep and

483
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:59,038
as the autonomous controls develop

484
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,120
the

485
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,038
it's time for them to kick in some

486
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,399
manufacturers auto manufacturers sort of

487
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:07,359
have something

488
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,280
beta version maybe an alpha version of

489
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,199
of this already starting to come online

490
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:13,759
where they have a little camera in the

491
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,319
wheel that i think tries to look at some

492
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:19,359
features almost everybody doing this and

493
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,359
it's very alpha

494
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,798
so

495
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,319
uh you know the thing that you currently

496
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:25,839
have some people have that in their car

497
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,159
there's a coffee cup or something that

498
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,079
comes up that you might be sleepy the

499
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,480
the primary signal that they're

500
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:35,759
comfortable using is the steering wheel

501
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,599
reversals so so basically using your

502
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:39,839
interaction with the steering wheel and

503
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,359
how much you're interacting with it as a

504
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:43,918
sign of sleepiness so if you have to

505
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:46,319
constantly correct the car yeah that's a

506
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,640
sign of like you starting to drift into

507
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,399
micro sleep i think that's a very very

508
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,480
crude signal it's probably a powerful

509
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,679
one there's a whole other component to

510
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,440
this which is

511
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,320
it seems like it's so driver and

512
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,200
subject-dependent

513
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,639
the

514
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,679
how our behavior changes as we

515
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,759
get sleepy and drowsy seems to be

516
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,679
different in complicated fascinating

517
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:10,960
ways where you can't just use one signal

518
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,038
it's kind of like what you're saying

519
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,400
there has to be a lot of different

520
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,119
signals that you should then be able to

521
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,840
combine the hope is there's uh the

522
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,759
searches for like universal signals that

523
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,439
are pretty damn good for like ninety

524
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,440
percent of people

525
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:28,080
but i don't think we need to take

526
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:31,038
necessarily quite that approach i think

527
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,079
what we could do in some clever fashion

528
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:34,319
is

529
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,079
using the individual so what you and i

530
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,038
are perhaps suggesting here is that

531
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,359
there is

532
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,079
an array of features that we know

533
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,678
provide information that is sensitive to

534
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:44,639
whether or not you're falling asleep at

535
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,559
the wheel

536
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,280
some of those let's say that there are

537
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:52,480
ten of them you know for me seven of

538
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:55,038
them are the cardinal features for you

539
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:58,160
however you know six of them and they're

540
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,759
not all the same sort of overlapping are

541
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,000
those for you

542
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,919
i think what we need is algorithms that

543
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,679
can firstly understand when you are well

544
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,360
slept so let's say that people have

545
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,360
sleep trackers at night and then your

546
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,439
car integrates that information that'd

547
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:14,079
be amazing understands when you are well

548
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,279
slept yeah and then you've got the data

549
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:20,720
of the individual behavior unique to

550
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:24,399
that individual snowflake like when they

551
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:26,480
are well slept this is the signature of

552
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,798
well-rested driving

553
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,599
then you can look at deviations from

554
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:34,639
that and patent match it with the sleep

555
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,240
history of that individual and then i

556
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,038
don't need to find

557
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,558
the sort of you know the

558
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:43,519
one-size-fits-all approach for 99 of the

559
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:45,918
people i can create a very bespoke

560
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:49,679
tailor-like set of features the savile

561
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,679
row suit of sleepiness features you know

562
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,600
that would be my if you want to ask me

563
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,480
about moonshots and crazy ideas that's

564
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,399
where i go but to start with i think

565
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,200
your approaches is a great one let's

566
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,280
find something that covers 99 of the

567
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,919
people because the worrying thing about

568
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:08,319
microsleeps of course unlike you know

569
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,480
drugs or alcohol which you know

570
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,839
certainly is a terrible thing to be

571
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,120
behind the wheel

572
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:17,439
with those often you

573
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:19,038
you react too late

574
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,080
and that's the reason you get into an

575
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,720
accident

576
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,960
when you fall asleep behind the wheel

577
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,400
you don't react at all

578
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,480
the you know at that point there is a

579
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,120
two-ton missile driving down the street

580
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,240
and no one's in control that's why those

581
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,519
accidents can often be more dangerous

582
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,759
yeah and

583
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,839
the fascinating thing is in the case of

584
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,000
semi-autonomous vehicles like tesla

585
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:45,359
autopilot this is where

586
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,119
i've had disagreements with mr elon musk

587
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:49,839
is uh

588
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,759
and uh the human factors community

589
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:53,599
which is this community that one of the

590
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,558
big things they study

591
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,639
is uh human supervision over automation

592
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,720
so you have like pilots

593
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,200
you know supervising an airplane that's

594
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,400
mostly flying autonomously the question

595
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,679
is

596
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,480
when we're actually doing the driving

597
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,480
how do micro sleeps or general how does

598
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,960
drowsiness progress and how does it

599
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,360
affect our driving that question becomes

600
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,759
more fascinating more complicated

601
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:22,240
when your task is not driving but

602
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,798
supervising the driving so your task is

603
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,679
to take over when stuff goes wrong and

604
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:27,759
that

605
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,159
is complicated but

606
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:32,798
the basic conclusions from many decades

607
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,159
is that humans are really crappy at

608
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:35,519
supervising

609
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,080
because they get

610
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,359
they get drowsy and lose vigilance much

611
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,359
much faster

612
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:44,399
the really surprising thing with tesla

613
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:46,479
autopilot it was surprising to me it's

614
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,159
surprising to uh the human factors

615
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,798
community and in fact they still argue

616
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,159
with me about it is uh it seems that

617
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:55,119
humans

618
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,880
in tesla's with autopilot

619
00:22:55,119 --> 00:22:58,639
and other similar systems are not

620
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,600
becoming less vigilant

621
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,080
at least

622
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,319
the with with the studies we've done so

623
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,359
there's something about the urgency of

624
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,439
driving

625
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,439
i can't i'm not sure the why but there's

626
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,759
something about the risk i think the

627
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,600
fact that you might die

628
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,400
is still keeping people

629
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:18,158
awake the question is as tesla autopilot

630
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
or similar systems get better and better

631
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,799
and better

632
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,798
how does that affect increasing

633
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,558
drowsiness and that's when you need to

634
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:27,200
have that's what the big disagreement

635
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:30,158
was you need to have driver sensing

636
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,279
meaning driver facing camera

637
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,120
that

638
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,798
tracks some kind of information about

639
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:37,599
the face that can tell you

640
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,839
uh drowsiness so you can tell the car if

641
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:41,359
you're drowsy so that the car can be

642
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,839
like you should be

643
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:46,558
probably driving or pull to the side

644
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:48,558
right or i need to do some of the heavy

645
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,278
lifting here yeah um so there needs to

646
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:53,599
be that dance of inter interaction

647
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:56,000
of a human and machine

648
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:58,000
but currently it's mostly uh steering

649
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,839
wheel based so

650
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,319
you know this this idea that your hands

651
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:03,119
should be on the on the steering wheel

652
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:05,759
that's

653
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,719
uh a sign that you're paying attention

654
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,558
is um isn't outdated and a very crude

655
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,240
metric i agree

656
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:14,000
yeah i think there are far more

657
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,038
sophisticated ways that we can solve

658
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,079
that problem

659
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:18,079
uh if we invest

660
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:24,558
big philosophical question

661
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:28,159
before we get into fun details um

662
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,158
on the topic of conscious states

663
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,278
how fundamental do you think is

664
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,439
consciousness to the human mind

665
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:38,880
i ask this from almost like a robotics

666
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:40,159
perspective so in your study of sleep

667
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,000
do you think

668
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,080
the the hard question of consciousness

669
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,200
that it feels like something

670
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:46,960
to be us

671
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,319
is that like a nice little feature like

672
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:52,960
a like a like a quark of our mind or is

673
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:55,759
it somehow fundamental because sleep

674
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,759
feels like we take we take a step out of

675
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,400
that consciousness a little bit

676
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,319
so from all your study of sleep

677
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,720
do you think consciousness is like

678
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:06,798
deeply part of who we are or is it just

679
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,600
a nice trick

680
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:11,918
i think it's a deeply embedded feature

681
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:15,918
that i can imagine has

682
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:18,159
a whole panoply of biological benefits

683
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:20,320
but to your point about sleep what is

684
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:23,278
interesting if you do a lot of dream

685
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:26,480
research and we've done some

686
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:29,519
it's very very rare

687
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,480
at all in fact for you to end up

688
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,158
becoming someone other than who you are

689
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,000
in your dreams now you can have

690
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,960
third-person perspective dreams where

691
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,079
you can see yourself in the dream as if

692
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:43,120
you're sort of

693
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:44,798
you know you've risen above your

694
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:47,119
your physical being

695
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:51,278
but for the most part it's very rare

696
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:53,278
that we lose our sense of conscious self

697
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:54,960
and maybe i'm sort of doing a sleight of

698
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,880
hand because it's really what i'm saying

699
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,240
it's very rare that we lose our sense of

700
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,480
who we are in dreams we never do now

701
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,599
that's not to suggest that dreams aren't

702
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,278
utterly

703
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,439
bizarre and

704
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,319
i mean you know when you slept last

705
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,240
night which i know um may have been

706
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:14,879
perhaps a little less than than me but

707
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:18,079
when you went into dreaming you know you

708
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,919
became flagrantly psychotic

709
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,918
and there are five essentially good

710
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,840
reasons firstly you started to see

711
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,200
things which were not there so you were

712
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:27,038
hallucinating

713
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,240
second you believe things that couldn't

714
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:33,440
possibly be true so you were delusional

715
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,839
third you became confused about time and

716
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,558
place and person so you're suffering

717
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,798
from what we would call disorientation

718
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,519
fourth you have wildly fluctuating

719
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:46,400
emotions something that um psychiatrists

720
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:48,158
will call being affectively labile

721
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,919
and then how wonderful you woke up this

722
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,200
morning and you forgot most if not all

723
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,278
of that dream experience so you're

724
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,759
suffering from amnesia if you had to

725
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,599
experience any one of those five things

726
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:00,558
while you're awake you would probably be

727
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:03,839
seeking psychological help

728
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:06,480
but what so i placed that as a backdrop

729
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:08,959
against your astute question because

730
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,880
despite all of that

731
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,880
psychosis

732
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,240
there is still a present

733
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,159
self

734
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,480
nested at the heart of it

735
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,679
meaning that i think it's very difficult

736
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,399
for us

737
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,159
to

738
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:26,479
abandon our conscious sense of self and

739
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,320
if it's that hard you know the old adage

740
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,240
in some ways that you can't outrun your

741
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,079
shadow but here it's more of a

742
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,558
philosophical question which is about

743
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:36,639
the conscious mind and what the state of

744
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:38,000
consciousness actually means in a human

745
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,200
being

746
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,398
so i think that that to me you can

747
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,880
you become

748
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:47,678
so dislocated from so many other

749
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,760
rational ways of waking consciousness

750
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,798
but one thing that won't go away that

751
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:51,919
won't get

752
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,519
perturbed

753
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,640
or sort of

754
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:57,519
you know

755
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,360
manicled is this your sense of conscious

756
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,359
self yeah that's a strong sign that

757
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,798
consciousness is fundamental to the

758
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,719
human mind

759
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:05,679
um or we're just creatures of habit

760
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,919
we've gotten used to having

761
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,360
consciousness maybe it just takes a lot

762
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,080
of uh

763
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,359
either chemical substances or a lot of

764
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:16,398
like

765
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:18,079
mental work to escape that i mean it's

766
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:19,199
like trying to launch

767
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,678
a rocket

768
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,480
you know the energy that has to be put

769
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,320
in to create escape velocity

770
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,480
from the gravitational pull of this

771
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:31,038
thing called planet earth is immense

772
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,480
yeah well the same thing is true

773
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:36,079
for

774
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,399
for us to abandon our sense of conscious

775
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,720
self the amount of biological the amount

776
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:43,278
of substances the amount of wacky stuff

777
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:46,240
that you have to do to truly get escaped

778
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:48,398
velocity from your conscious self

779
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,679
what does that tell us about then the

780
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,079
fundamental

781
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,559
state of our conscious self

782
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,558
yeah it also probably says that that

783
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,599
it's quite useful to have consciousness

784
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:02,000
for uh for survival and for just

785
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:04,079
operation in this world and perhaps for

786
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,558
intelligence i'm one of the on the ai

787
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,000
side people that think

788
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,319
that uh

789
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,798
intelligence requires consciousness so

790
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:14,398
like high levels of general intelligence

791
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,879
requires consciousness

792
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:18,479
most people in the ai field think like

793
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:20,080
consciousness and intelligence are

794
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,079
fundamentally different you can build a

795
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:23,759
computer that's super intelligent it

796
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,038
doesn't have to be conscious

797
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:26,798
i think that

798
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,879
if you define super intelligence by

799
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,359
being good at chess yes but if you

800
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,840
define super intelligence as being able

801
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:34,879
to operate in this living world of

802
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,639
humans

803
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,039
and be able to perform all kinds of

804
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,759
different tasks consciousness

805
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,558
it seems to be somehow fundamental

806
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:47,119
to uh like to to to richly integrate

807
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:49,200
yourself into the human experience into

808
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,879
society it feels like you have to be a

809
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,319
conscious being

810
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,240
but then we don't even know what

811
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,639
consciousness is and we certainly don't

812
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,440
know how to engineer it in our machines

813
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,080
i love the fact that there are still

814
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,399
questions that are so embryonic

815
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:05,599
because you know i suspect it's the same

816
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:08,558
with you

817
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:10,639
answers to me are simply ways to get to

818
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,759
more questions you know it's questions

819
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,759
where

820
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:14,879
you know questions turn me on answers

821
00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:18,000
less so

822
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,880
and i love the fact that we are still

823
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,240
embryonic in our sense of arguing about

824
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,039
even what the definition of

825
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,120
consciousness is but i also find it

826
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:28,720
fascinating i i think it's thoroughly

827
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,079
delightful to absorb yourself in the

828
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:33,200
thought

829
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:35,918
think about the brain and we can move

830
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,880
back across the complexity of phylogeny

831
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:42,000
from you know humans to mammals to sort

832
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,440
of birds to reptiles amphibians fish and

833
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,200
you can

834
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,038
bacteria whatever you want and you can

835
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:49,038
go through this and say okay where is

836
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,119
the hard line of you know what we would

837
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,798
define as consciousness and

838
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:55,199
and i'm sure it's got something to do

839
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,440
with the complexity of the neural system

840
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,640
of that i'm fairly certain

841
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:01,360
but

842
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:03,278
to me it's always been fascinating

843
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,000
so what is it then you know is it that i

844
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,440
just keep adding neurons to a petri dish

845
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,960
and i just keep adding them and adding

846
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,880
them and adding them at some point when

847
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,840
i hit a critical mass of interconnected

848
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,519
neurons that is the mass of the you know

849
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:17,519
the interconnected human brain then

850
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,919
bingo

851
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,159
all of a sudden it kicks into gear and

852
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,080
we have consciousness like a phase shift

853
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,679
phase transition of some kind correct

854
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:27,599
yeah but there is something about the

855
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,200
complexity of the nervous system that i

856
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:30,480
think is fundamental to consciousness

857
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,360
and the reason i bring that up is

858
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,720
because

859
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:35,359
when we're trying to then think about

860
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,759
creating it in an artificial way does

861
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:39,678
that inform us as to the complexity that

862
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,440
we should be looking at in terms of

863
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,600
development

864
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,399
i also think that it's a missed

865
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:49,119
opportunity in the

866
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:52,158
sort of digital space for us to try to

867
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:54,798
recreate human consciousness

868
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,480
we've already got human consciousness

869
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,200
what if we were to think about

870
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,558
creating some other form of why do we

871
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,519
have to think that

872
00:32:00,558 --> 00:32:06,000
the ultimate in the creation of you know

873
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,440
an artificial intelligence is the

874
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,480
replication

875
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,240
you know

876
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,720
of a human

877
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,359
state of consciousness can we not think

878
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,440
outside of our own

879
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,000
consciousness and believe that there is

880
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,210
something even more incredible or

881
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,079
more complementary more orthogonal

882
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,079
[Music]

883
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,960
so i'm sometimes

884
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:30,960
perplexed that people are trying to

885
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,120
mimic human consciousness rather than

886
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,200
think about creating

887
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,199
something that's different yeah i think

888
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,440
of human consciousness or consciousness

889
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,038
in general is this magic

890
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,600
um

891
00:32:41,038 --> 00:32:45,359
superpower that allows us to deeply

892
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,278
experience the world and just as you're

893
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,678
saying i don't think that superpower has

894
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:51,759
to take the exact flavor as humans have

895
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,159
that's my love for robots

896
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:57,119
i would love to

897
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,240
add the ability to robots that can

898
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:03,038
experience the world and other humans

899
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:05,120
uh deeply i'm humbled by the fact that

900
00:33:03,038 --> 00:33:06,879
that idea does not necessarily need to

901
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,359
look anything like

902
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,120
how humans experience the world

903
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:15,519
but there's a dance of um

904
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:18,479
human to robot connection the same way

905
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,240
human to dog a human to cat connection

906
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,159
that there's a there's a there's a magic

907
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,839
there to that interaction and i'm not

908
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,559
sure how to create that magic but it's a

909
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,918
worthy effort i also love just exactly

910
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:29,519
as you said

911
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,000
on the question of consciousness or

912
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,880
engineering consciousness

913
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:37,038
the fun thing about this problem

914
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,720
is it seems obvious to me that a hundred

915
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:40,798
years from now

916
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,278
no matter what we do today

917
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,079
uh people if we're still here

918
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:44,880
will

919
00:33:44,079 --> 00:33:47,519
laugh

920
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,760
at how silly our notions were so like

921
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,558
it's almost impossible for me to imagine

922
00:33:49,759 --> 00:33:53,839
that we will truly solve this problem

923
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:55,839
fully

924
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:59,038
in my lifetime

925
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:59,918
and and more than that everything we'll

926
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,720
do

927
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,519
will be silly 100 years from now but

928
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,360
it's still a war that makes it fun to me

929
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:10,239
because it's like you have the full

930
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:13,519
freedom to not even be right

931
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:14,398
just to try just to try as freedom and

932
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,398
uh

933
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:17,679
and i that's how i see that t-shirt

934
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:20,559
please

935
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,240
i love that so i and you know the human

936
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,078
robot interaction is fascinating because

937
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:26,559
it's like it's like watching dancing

938
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:29,039
i've been uh

939
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:31,519
dancing tango recently and just it's

940
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,759
like there is no goal the goal is to

941
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:35,280
create something magical

942
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,760
and uh

943
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,639
whether consciousness or emotion or

944
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,440
elegance of movement all of those things

945
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,000
uh aid in the creation of the magic and

946
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,639
it's a free it's an art form to explore

947
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,320
how how to make that um

948
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,639
how to create that in a way that's

949
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,480
compelling yeah i love that the line in

950
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,079
sense of a woman with al pacino where

951
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,480
he's speaking about the tango and he

952
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:00,160
said really it's just freedom that

953
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,679
if you get tangled up you just keep

954
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,078
tangoing on

955
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:06,399
i still to this day

956
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,720
i think uh well first the second time i

957
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,358
talked to joe rogan on his podcast

958
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,039
i said we got into this heated argument

959
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,719
about whether a

960
00:35:13,039 --> 00:35:16,639
sensible woman is a better movie than

961
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:19,199
john wick

962
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:21,279
because it's one of my favorite movies

963
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:24,239
for many reasons one is for sensible

964
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,640
women some scent of a woman uh partially

965
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,919
know that by the way it's just you just

966
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:30,319
yeah i don't know if you would actually

967
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,320
know of awesome awesome yeah yeah i said

968
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,559
i love the tango scene i love al

969
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,720
pacino's performance

970
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,960
it's a wonderful movie

971
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:40,959
then joe joe was saying john wick is

972
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,880
better so we to this day argue about

973
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,199
this i think it depends in on what

974
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,838
conscious state you're in yes that you

975
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,838
would be ready and receptive to but um

976
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:52,880
sense of woman i think it has one of the

977
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:55,759
best monologues at the end of the movie

978
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,960
that has ever been written or at least

979
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,480
performed

980
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,240
when al pacino

981
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,920
defends the

982
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,039
the younger

983
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,480
yeah i

984
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,159
uh

985
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,159
i often think about that there's been

986
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:09,838
times in my life

987
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,598
i don't know about you

988
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:12,480
where i wish i had an al pacino in my

989
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,440
life

990
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,760
where

991
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,760
um

992
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,519
integrity is really important in this

993
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:22,559
life it is and sometimes you find

994
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:24,400
yourself in places where

995
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:28,159
there's pressure to sacrifice that

996
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:30,800
integrity and you want uh what is it

997
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:31,920
lieutenant colonel or whatever he was

998
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,800
coming

999
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,680
yeah

1000
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,039
come in uh on your side and scream at

1001
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,480
everyone and say what the hell are we

1002
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,639
doing here

1003
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,880
being you know unfortunately

1004
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,838
british and sort of having that slightly

1005
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,519
um

1006
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:47,279
awkward sort of huge grand gene it's

1007
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,880
it's very very

1008
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,839
at the opposite end of the spectrum of

1009
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,720
the remarkable feat of uh al pacino at

1010
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:57,039
the end of that scene but um and yeah

1011
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:58,719
integrity is um it's a

1012
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,440
challenging

1013
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,399
thing and i value it much and i think

1014
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,159
um

1015
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,960
it can take 20 years to build a

1016
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:09,519
reputation in two minutes to lose it and

1017
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,119
there is nothing more that i value than

1018
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,960
but integrity and

1019
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,440
you know if i'm ever wrong about

1020
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,400
anything i truly don't want to be

1021
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:19,280
wrong for any longer than i have to be

1022
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,680
um

1023
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,839
you know that's what being in some ways

1024
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:25,598
a scientist is you're

1025
00:37:23,838 --> 00:37:27,759
you're just driven by truth and the

1026
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,880
irony relative to something like

1027
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,000
mathematics is that in science you never

1028
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,240
find truth what all you do in science is

1029
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:38,079
you discount the things that are likely

1030
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,719
to be untrue

1031
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,519
leaving only the possibility of what

1032
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,358
could be true yeah but in math

1033
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:49,119
you know when you create

1034
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:50,559
you know a proof it's a proof for

1035
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,960
you know

1036
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:54,960
from that point forward there is truth

1037
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,800
in mathematics and there's i think

1038
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,358
there's a beauty in that

1039
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,359
but i kind of like the messiness of of

1040
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:03,759
science because again

1041
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,078
to me it's less about the truth of the

1042
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,880
answer and it is more about the pursuit

1043
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,560
of questions but their integrity becomes

1044
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,400
more and more important and it becomes

1045
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,679
more difficult there's a lot of

1046
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,960
pressures just like in the rest of the

1047
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,159
world but

1048
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,119
there's a lot of pressures on a

1049
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:21,279
scientist one is like funding sources

1050
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,400
yeah i've noticed this that um you know

1051
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:27,040
money affects everyone's mind i think

1052
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,599
i've been always somebody that

1053
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,159
i believe money can't you can't buy

1054
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:34,320
my opinion uh i don't care how much

1055
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,679
money billions or trillions

1056
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,119
the

1057
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,279
but that pressure is there and you have

1058
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,079
to be very cognizant of it and make sure

1059
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,760
that

1060
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:43,280
your opinion is not defined by the

1061
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,280
funding sources

1062
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,880
and then the other is just your own

1063
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:49,359
success

1064
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,440
of uh you know for a couple of decades

1065
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:53,759
publishing an idea

1066
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,440
um

1067
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,079
and then realizing at some point that

1068
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,000
that idea was wrong all along right and

1069
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,640
that that's a tough thing for people to

1070
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,280
do but that's also integrity is to walk

1071
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,159
away is to say that you were wrong

1072
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,680
um

1073
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:09,838
that doesn't have to be in some big

1074
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,719
dramatic way it could be in a bunch of

1075
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:15,759
tiny ways along the way right

1076
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:17,279
like uh reconfigure your intuition about

1077
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,720
a particular

1078
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,560
uh problem

1079
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:22,319
that's and all of that is integrity when

1080
00:39:20,559 --> 00:39:24,320
everybody in the room

1081
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,838
uh you know believes a certain thing

1082
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,359
everybody in the community believes a

1083
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:29,440
certain thing

1084
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:30,880
to uh to be able to still be open-minded

1085
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,358
in the face of that

1086
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,960
yeah and i think it comes down in some

1087
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:39,199
ways to the issue of ego that you bond

1088
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,639
your you know correctness or your

1089
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:44,719
rightness your scientific theory with

1090
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,679
your sense of

1091
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,199
ego

1092
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,598
you know i've never found it that

1093
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,719
difficult to let go of

1094
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,039
theories in the face of counter evidence

1095
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,919
in part because i have such low

1096
00:39:55,039 --> 00:39:59,279
self-esteem well i i kind of like that i

1097
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,440
always like that combination i have the

1098
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,760
same i'm like very self-critical

1099
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,760
imposter syndrome all those things

1100
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,240
uh putting yourself below the podium but

1101
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,880
at the same time having the ego that

1102
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,598
drives the ambition to work your ass off

1103
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,800
like some kind of weird drive

1104
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:17,359
maybe

1105
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,359
like to drive to be better like thinking

1106
00:40:17,358 --> 00:40:21,598
yourself is not that great and always

1107
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:22,880
driving to be better and at the same

1108
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,880
time because that's that can be

1109
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,880
paralyzing and exhausting

1110
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,519
and so on at the same time just being

1111
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,358
grateful to be alive but in the sciences

1112
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,039
in the actual effort

1113
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:34,639
never be satisfied never think of

1114
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:37,920
yourself highly that seems to be a nice

1115
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:41,199
combination i very much hope that that

1116
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,318
is part of who i am and i

1117
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:46,480
remain very quietly motivated and driven

1118
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:48,480
and i like you

1119
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:50,318
love the idea of perfection and i know i

1120
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,920
will never achieve it but i will never

1121
00:40:50,318 --> 00:40:55,440
stop trying to so

1122
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,079
similar to you which sounds weird

1123
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:00,960
because there's all these videos of uh

1124
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,599
of me on the internet

1125
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:05,519
so i think i think i just naturally lean

1126
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:07,680
into the things i'm afraid of and i'm

1127
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,239
uncomfortable doing yeah like i'm very

1128
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:11,279
afraid of talking to people and you know

1129
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,279
just even

1130
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:15,280
before talking to you today just a lot

1131
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:17,839
of anxiety anxiety and all those kinds

1132
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,640
of things about talking to me yeah yeah

1133
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:20,480
oh

1134
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:23,118
nervousness

1135
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,639
uh fear in some cases uh self-doubt and

1136
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,960
all those kinds of things

1137
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:29,118
but i do it anyway so the reason i bring

1138
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,920
that up is um

1139
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,400
you've uh launched a podcast

1140
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,920
i have

1141
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,639
allow me to say i think you're a great

1142
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,559
science communicator so this

1143
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:42,879
challenge of

1144
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,880
being

1145
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,079
afraid or

1146
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,960
cautious of being in the public eye and

1147
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,519
yet

1148
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,440
having a longing to communicate some of

1149
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:55,838
the things you're excited about

1150
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:59,039
in the space of sleep and beyond

1151
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:02,719
what's your vision with this project

1152
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:06,159
i think firstly to your to that question

1153
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:07,838
like you i am always more afraid of not

1154
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:08,719
trying than trying

1155
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:11,920
yeah

1156
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:15,519
that to me frightens me more

1157
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:18,480
but with the podcast i think

1158
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:21,280
really i have two very simple goals

1159
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,800
i want to try and democratize the

1160
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,880
science of sleep

1161
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:27,039
and in doing so my goal would be to try

1162
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,400
and reunite humanity with the sleep that

1163
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:32,800
it is so desperately bereft of

1164
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,160
and if i can do that through a number of

1165
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,280
different means

1166
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:36,960
um

1167
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,079
the podcast is a little bit different

1168
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,199
than this format it's are going to be

1169
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,680
short form monologues

1170
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:48,078
from yours truly uh that will last

1171
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,799
usually less than just 10 minutes and i

1172
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,200
see it as simply a little slice of sleep

1173
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,000
goodness that can accompany your waking

1174
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:59,199
day it's hard to know what is the right

1175
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:02,400
way to do science communication like uh

1176
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,799
your friend mine andrew huberman

1177
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:08,318
is does he he's an incredible human

1178
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,640
being okay so he does like two hours

1179
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:11,920
of i wonder how many takes he does i

1180
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:13,679
don't know but it looks like he doesn't

1181
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:16,159
do anything

1182
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:18,799
he's that magnificent of a human being

1183
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:21,598
when i talk to him in like in person

1184
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,519
he always generates intelligent words

1185
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,079
well cited non-stop for hours so i don't

1186
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:30,079
he's a gatling gun of information and

1187
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,680
it's pristine and passion and all those

1188
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,800
kinds of things so that's an interesting

1189
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:35,118
medium i

1190
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,560
i wouldn't have um

1191
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,240
it's funny because i wouldn't have done

1192
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:39,679
it the way he's doing it i wouldn't

1193
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,279
advise him to do it the way he's doing

1194
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:43,679
it because i thought there's no way you

1195
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,160
could do what you're doing

1196
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:46,960
because it's a lot of work uh but he is

1197
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:48,639
like

1198
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,440
doing an incredible job of it i just

1199
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:51,039
think

1200
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:53,519
it's the same with like dan carlin in

1201
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:56,559
hardcore history i thought

1202
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:58,960
i thought that the way andrew's doing it

1203
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:02,400
would crush him the way

1204
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,960
he crushes dan carlin so dan has so much

1205
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,800
pressure on him to do a good job that he

1206
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,000
ends up publishing like two episodes a

1207
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,079
year

1208
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,838
so that pressure can be paralyzing the

1209
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:13,599
pressure of like

1210
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:16,480
putting out like

1211
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,119
strong scientific statements that that

1212
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,519
can be overwhelming now andrew seems to

1213
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:23,760
be just plowing through anyway if

1214
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:25,679
there's mistakes he'll he'll say there's

1215
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,040
corrections and so on yeah i just i

1216
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:28,879
wonder i actually haven't talked to him

1217
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,639
too much about it like psychologically

1218
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,800
how difficult is it

1219
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:34,559
to put yourself out there for an hour

1220
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,839
two a week

1221
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,679
of just non-stop dropping knowledge

1222
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:42,239
any one sentence of which could be

1223
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,559
totally wrong it could be a mistake and

1224
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,959
there will be yeah mistakes you know and

1225
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:49,440
i you know in the first edition of my

1226
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,400
book there were errors that you know we

1227
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,119
corrected in the second edition too

1228
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,760
but

1229
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,400
there will be probabilistically you know

1230
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,119
if you've got you know 10 facts per page

1231
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,318
of a book and you've got

1232
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:05,119
350 pages

1233
00:45:02,318 --> 00:45:07,679
odds are it's probably not going to be

1234
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:11,680
utter perfection out the gate and it

1235
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:13,519
will be the same way for andrew too

1236
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,159
but having the

1237
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:16,960
the reverence of

1238
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,279
um

1239
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,599
a humble mind

1240
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,200
and simply accepting the things that are

1241
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,200
wrong and correcting them and doing the

1242
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:26,559
right thing i know that that's his

1243
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:27,279
mentality

1244
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:28,719
i

1245
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,319
do want to say that i'm just kind of

1246
00:45:28,719 --> 00:45:33,039
honored to be

1247
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:36,159
it's like it's a cool group of like

1248
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:38,000
scientific people that uh i'm fortunate

1249
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:41,039
enough to not be interacting with this

1250
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,480
is you and andrew and um david sinclair

1251
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,159
has been thinking about throwing his hat

1252
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,559
in the ring oh i hope so david is

1253
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,559
another one of those very special people

1254
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,480
in the world so it's cool because

1255
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,239
podcasts are

1256
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:55,119
it's cool it's a it's such a powerful

1257
00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:57,279
medium of communication it's much freer

1258
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,160
than more constrained like publications

1259
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:02,160
and so on or it's much more accessible

1260
00:46:00,159 --> 00:46:04,559
and inspiring than like i don't know

1261
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,719
conference presentations or lectures and

1262
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:08,000
it's it's a really exciting medium to me

1263
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,000
and it's cool that there's this like

1264
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,159
group of people that uh

1265
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,639
are becoming friends and putting stuff

1266
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,639
out there and supporting each other so

1267
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:18,719
it's fun to also watch

1268
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:22,400
how that's going to evolve in your case

1269
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,399
because it wonder it'd be too much

1270
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:27,598
is the answer to that like

1271
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:29,519
well i mean some of it is persistence

1272
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,440
through the challenges that we've been

1273
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,280
talking about which is like i think i've

1274
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:35,200
got a lot to learn yeah but i will

1275
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,280
persist

1276
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:39,439
look can i ask you some detailed stuff

1277
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,400
you mentioned that goodness go anywhere

1278
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:45,200
you wish with sleep uh so

1279
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,559
i'm a big fan of coffee and caffeine

1280
00:46:45,199 --> 00:46:48,318
and i've been

1281
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,000
especially the last few days consuming a

1282
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:54,079
very large amount

1283
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,079
and i'm cognizant of the fact that

1284
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,279
my body is affected by caffeine

1285
00:46:56,159 --> 00:46:59,199
different than

1286
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,560
the anecdotal information that other

1287
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:03,759
people tell me

1288
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,799
i seem to be not at all affected by it

1289
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,400
it's almost

1290
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:09,519
um

1291
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,000
it feels like more like a ritual then it

1292
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:14,559
is a chemical boost to my performance

1293
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,639
like i can drink several cups of coffee

1294
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:17,599
right before bed and just knock out

1295
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:19,598
anyway

1296
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,119
i'm not sure if it's a biological

1297
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,880
chemical or it has to do with just the

1298
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,838
fact that i'm just consuming huge

1299
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:28,160
amounts of caffeine all that to say

1300
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,440
uh

1301
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:32,239
what do you think is the relationship

1302
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:33,440
between coffee and sleep caffeine and

1303
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,598
sleep if there's an interesting

1304
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,679
distinction there there is a distinction

1305
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,079
so i think the first thing to say which

1306
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:42,960
is going to sound strange coming from me

1307
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,519
is drink coffee

1308
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:47,199
um the health benefits associated with

1309
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:50,318
drinking coffee are

1310
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:51,118
really quite well established now

1311
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:53,679
um

1312
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:55,920
but i think that the counterpoint to

1313
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:58,719
that well firstly the dose and the

1314
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,119
timing make the poison and i'll perhaps

1315
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,639
come back to that in just a second

1316
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:03,920
but for

1317
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:07,118
coffee

1318
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,159
it's actually not the caffeine

1319
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:10,480
so

1320
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:12,719
you know a lot of people have asked me

1321
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:14,480
about this rightful paradox between the

1322
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,480
fact that sleep provides all of these

1323
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,480
incredible health benefits

1324
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:19,760
and then coffee which can have a

1325
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,079
deleterious

1326
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,000
impact on your sleep has

1327
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,240
a whole collection of health benefits

1328
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,719
many of them venn diagram overlapping

1329
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:31,118
with those that sleep provides how on

1330
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:33,199
earth can you reconcile those two

1331
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,880
and the answer is that

1332
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:35,838
well the answer is very simple it's

1333
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,599
called

1334
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:40,078
antioxidants

1335
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:42,960
but it turns out that for most people in

1336
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,760
western civilization because of diet not

1337
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,240
being quite what it should be

1338
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,200
the major source through which they

1339
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:53,919
obtain antioxidants is the coffee bean

1340
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:56,239
so the the humble coffee bean has now

1341
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,119
been asked to carry the astronomical

1342
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:00,479
weight

1343
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,720
of serving up the large majority of

1344
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,519
people's antioxidant needs

1345
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:05,759
and

1346
00:49:03,519 --> 00:49:08,400
you can see this if for example you look

1347
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,960
at the health benefits of decaffeinated

1348
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,960
coffee it has a whole constellation of

1349
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:14,960
really great health benefits too so it's

1350
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:17,440
not like caffeine and that's why i liked

1351
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,760
what you said this sort of separation of

1352
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,159
church and state between coffee and

1353
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,800
caffeine it's not the caffeine it's the

1354
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:26,799
coffee bean itself that provides those

1355
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,400
health benefits but

1356
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:32,720
coming back to how it impacts sleep it

1357
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,000
impacts sleep in probably at least three

1358
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:37,519
different ways

1359
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:39,519
the first is that for most people

1360
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:41,599
caffeine can make it obviously a little

1361
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:43,599
harder to fall asleep

1362
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:44,400
caffeine can make it harder to stay

1363
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,920
asleep

1364
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,760
but let's say that you are one of those

1365
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,358
individuals and i think you are

1366
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,680
and you can say look i can have three or

1367
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:53,759
four espressos with dinner and i fall

1368
00:49:51,679 --> 00:49:55,519
asleep just fine and i stay asleep

1369
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:56,880
soundly across the light so there's no

1370
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:59,280
problem

1371
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,760
the downside there is that even if that

1372
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:04,160
is true the amount of deep sleep that

1373
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,319
you get will not be as deep and so you

1374
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:08,639
will actually lose somewhere between 10

1375
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:11,199
to 30 percent of your deep sleep if you

1376
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,920
drink caffeine in the evening

1377
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:16,480
so to give you some context to to drop

1378
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:19,200
your deep sleep by let's say 20 i'd

1379
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:20,960
probably have to age you by 15 years or

1380
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:22,318
you could do it every night with a cup

1381
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,800
of coffee

1382
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,480
i think the fourth component that is

1383
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:29,200
perhaps less well understood about

1384
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,639
coffee is its timing and that's why i

1385
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,118
was saying the timing and the dose make

1386
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,039
the poison the dose by the way once you

1387
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,519
get past about three cups of coffee a

1388
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:40,079
day the health benefits actually start

1389
00:50:37,519 --> 00:50:42,159
to turn down in the opposite direction

1390
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,400
so there is a u-shape function it's sort

1391
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:46,558
of you know the goldilocks syndrome not

1392
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,920
too little not too much just the right

1393
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,400
amount

1394
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,760
the second component is the timing

1395
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,200
though caffeine has a half-life of about

1396
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:57,680
five to six hours

1397
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,000
meaning that after five to six hours

1398
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:02,318
fifty percent of that on average for the

1399
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,400
average adult is still in the system

1400
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:06,558
which means that it has a quarter life

1401
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,720
of 10 to 12 hours so in other words if

1402
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,559
you have a coffee at noon a quarter of

1403
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,558
that caffeine is still circulating in

1404
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:14,960
your brain at midnight

1405
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,480
so having a cup of coffee at noon one

1406
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,318
could argue is the equivalent of tucking

1407
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,159
yourself into bed at midnight and before

1408
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:22,639
you turn the light out you swig a

1409
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,558
quarter of a cup of coffee but that

1410
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:27,039
doesn't still answer your question as to

1411
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,880
why are you so immune so i'm someone who

1412
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:31,599
is actually unfortunately very sensitive

1413
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,880
to caffeine and if i have you know even

1414
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:38,160
two cups of coffee in the morning

1415
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:39,760
i i don't sleep as well that night and i

1416
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:41,920
find it miserable because i love the

1417
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:44,480
smell of coffee i love the routine i

1418
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,200
love the ritual i think i would love to

1419
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,440
be invested in it it's just terrible for

1420
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:51,199
my sleep so i switched to decaf

1421
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,880
there is a difference from one

1422
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:56,639
individual to the next and it's

1423
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,599
controlled by a set of liver enzymes

1424
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:01,118
called

1425
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,960
cytochrome p450 enzymes and there is a

1426
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:05,358
particular gene

1427
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:09,358
that if you have a different sort of

1428
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:11,598
version of this gene it's called cyp

1429
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:14,880
1 a 2

1430
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:17,039
that gene will determine the speed of

1431
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,519
the clearance of caffeine from your

1432
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,838
system some people will have a version

1433
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,719
of that gene that is very effective and

1434
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:27,358
efficient at clearing that caffeine and

1435
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:30,799
so their half-life could be as short as

1436
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:34,078
two hours rather than five to six hours

1437
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,720
other people hands up matt walker um

1438
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,280
have a version of that gene that is not

1439
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:42,480
very effective at clearing out the uh

1440
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,720
the caffeine and therefore the half-life

1441
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:48,079
sort of sensitivity could be somewhere

1442
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:49,519
between you know eight to nine hours

1443
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,359
so we understand that there are

1444
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:52,639
individual differences but overall i

1445
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:54,480
guess the

1446
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:57,679
top line here is

1447
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,119
drink coffee um and understand that it's

1448
00:52:57,679 --> 00:53:00,719
not the caffeine it's the coffee that's

1449
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:03,200
the benefit and the dose makes the

1450
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,719
poison is there some aspect to it that's

1451
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:06,159
it's like a muscle

1452
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:07,759
in terms of the

1453
00:53:06,159 --> 00:53:09,519
all the combination of letters and

1454
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,839
numbers that you just said is there some

1455
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:13,759
aspect that if um

1456
00:53:11,838 --> 00:53:15,838
i can improve

1457
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,079
the quarter life the half-life

1458
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:19,838
can decrease that number if i just

1459
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,839
practice

1460
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,838
like i drink a lot of coffee so like

1461
00:53:21,838 --> 00:53:25,838
habit

1462
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:28,480
alters how your body is able to get rid

1463
00:53:25,838 --> 00:53:31,039
of the caffeine not how the body is able

1464
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,039
to get rid of the caffeine but it does

1465
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:34,960
alter how sensitive

1466
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:37,838
the body is to the caffeine and it's not

1467
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,000
at the level of the enzyme degrading the

1468
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:44,000
caffeine it's at the level of the

1469
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:45,838
receptors that caffeine will act upon

1470
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,440
now it turns out that those are called

1471
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,679
adenosine receptors and maybe we can

1472
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:52,159
speak about what adenosine is and sleep

1473
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:54,558
pressure and all of that good stuff but

1474
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:56,318
as you start to drink more and more

1475
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,200
coffee

1476
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:00,800
the body tries to fight back and it

1477
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:03,039
happens with many different drugs by the

1478
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,440
way and it's called tolerance

1479
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:08,000
and so one of the ways that your body

1480
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,000
becomes tolerant to a drug is that the

1481
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,679
receptors that the drug is binding to

1482
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,239
these sort of welcome sites these sort

1483
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:16,239
of you know picture myths as it were

1484
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,318
that receive the drug

1485
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:21,519
those start to get

1486
00:54:18,318 --> 00:54:23,119
taken away from the surface of the cell

1487
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,039
and it's what we call receptor

1488
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:27,440
internalization

1489
00:54:25,039 --> 00:54:28,880
so the cell starts to think gee where's

1490
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,519
you know this there's a lot of

1491
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:32,880
stimulation going on this is too much so

1492
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:35,119
i'm just going to

1493
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,760
when normally i would you know coat my

1494
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:40,559
cell with let's just say five of these

1495
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,160
receptors for argument's sake

1496
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:44,000
things are going a little bit too

1497
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:46,159
ballistic right now i'm going to take

1498
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,079
away at least two of those receptors and

1499
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:49,039
downscale it to just having three of

1500
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,519
those

1501
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:53,599
and now you need two cups of coffee to

1502
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:55,440
get the same effect that one cup of

1503
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:58,400
coffee got you before

1504
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:02,240
and that's why then when you go

1505
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:05,519
cold turkey on coffee all of a sudden

1506
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:08,558
the system has equilibriated itself to

1507
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:10,239
expecting x amount of stimulation and

1508
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,119
now all of that stimulation is gone so

1509
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:15,598
it's now got too few receptors and you

1510
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,599
have a caffeine withdrawal syndrome

1511
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,000
and that's why for example with you know

1512
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:23,359
drugs of abuse things like heroin when

1513
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,199
people go into abstinence

1514
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:26,798
you know as they're sort of moving into

1515
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,118
their addiction

1516
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:31,280
they will build up a progressive

1517
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,160
tolerance to that drug so they need to

1518
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,400
take more of it to get the same high but

1519
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:38,879
then if they go cold turkey

1520
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,720
for some period of time the system goes

1521
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,798
back to being more sensitive again it

1522
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:45,519
starts to repopulate the surface of the

1523
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:47,599
cell with these receptors but now when

1524
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:49,440
they reuse and they fall off the wagon

1525
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:51,440
if they go back to the same dose that

1526
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,760
they were using before

1527
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,639
you know 10 weeks ago or three months

1528
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,680
ago

1529
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:58,078
that dose

1530
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:59,598
can kill them they can have an overdose

1531
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,480
even though they were using the same

1532
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:05,039
amount at those two different times the

1533
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,358
difference is that it's not the dose of

1534
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:09,759
the drug it's the sensitivity of the

1535
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:11,920
system and that's the same thing that we

1536
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:14,400
see with caffeine in terms of training

1537
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:17,599
the muscle as it were is the system

1538
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,240
becomes less sensitive can calibrate

1539
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:22,798
is there a time

1540
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:24,879
the number of hours before bed

1541
00:56:22,798 --> 00:56:27,440
that's a safe bet

1542
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,160
to most people to recommend

1543
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,039
you shouldn't drink caffeine this many

1544
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:33,519
hours

1545
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,960
like is there an average half-life that

1546
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,199
you should be aiming at

1547
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,720
yeah or is this advice kind of

1548
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,199
impossible because there's so much

1549
00:56:38,719 --> 00:56:43,519
variability there is a huge variability

1550
00:56:41,199 --> 00:56:46,798
and i think everyone themselves you know

1551
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:48,639
to a degree knows it although i'll put a

1552
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:50,400
caveat on that too because it's slightly

1553
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,639
dangerous point

1554
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:55,039
so the recommendation for the average

1555
00:56:52,639 --> 00:56:56,798
adult and who where is the average adult

1556
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,400
in society there is no such thing but

1557
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:00,000
for the average adult

1558
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,280
it would be probably cutting yourself

1559
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,159
off maybe 10 hours you know before so

1560
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,079
assuming a normative bedtime in society

1561
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:09,598
i would say try to stop drinking

1562
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:11,680
caffeine you know

1563
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,200
before 2 pm and

1564
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,879
just keep an eye out you know and if

1565
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:16,078
you're struggling with sleep dial down

1566
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,920
the caffeine and see if it makes a

1567
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,839
difference

1568
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,039
can i ask you about sleep

1569
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:22,480
and

1570
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:23,279
learning

1571
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,440
so

1572
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,359
how does sleep affect learning

1573
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:30,240
sleep

1574
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:31,679
before learning sleep after learning

1575
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:33,039
which are both fascinating kind of

1576
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:35,039
dynamics

1577
00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:37,838
of the mind's interaction with this

1578
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:39,440
extra conscious state

1579
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:40,719
yeah sleep is

1580
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:42,639
profoundly

1581
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,959
and very intimately related to your

1582
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:46,480
memory systems and your informational

1583
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:48,720
systems

1584
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:51,440
the first as you just mentioned is that

1585
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:53,358
sleep before learning will essentially

1586
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:56,000
prepare your brain

1587
00:57:53,358 --> 00:57:56,880
almost like a dry sponge ready to sort

1588
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,199
of

1589
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,720
initially soak up new information in

1590
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:03,439
other words you need sleep before

1591
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:05,679
learning to effectively imprint

1592
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:09,440
information into the brain to lay down

1593
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:11,279
fresh memory traces and without sleep

1594
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,838
the memory circuits of the brain and we

1595
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,960
know we've studied these memory circuits

1596
00:58:13,838 --> 00:58:16,960
it will

1597
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,559
you know essentially become waterlogged

1598
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,318
as it were for the sponge analogy and

1599
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:23,920
you can't absorb

1600
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:26,400
the information as effectively

1601
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,559
so you need sleep before learning but

1602
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,079
you also need sleep unfortunately after

1603
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,480
learning too

1604
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,200
to then take those freshly minted

1605
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,039
memories and effectively hit the save

1606
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:39,759
button on them but it's nowhere near as

1607
00:58:37,039 --> 00:58:41,679
quick as a digital system it takes hours

1608
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:43,760
because it's a physical biological

1609
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:46,798
change that happens at the level of

1610
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:51,040
brain cells but sleep after learning

1611
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:52,719
will cement and solidify that new memory

1612
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,279
into the neural architecture of the

1613
00:58:52,719 --> 00:58:56,959
brain therefore making it less likely to

1614
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,000
be forgotten

1615
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,838
so

1616
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:01,199
you know i often think of sleep in that

1617
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:03,599
way as

1618
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:05,519
it's almost sort of future proofing

1619
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,798
information

1620
00:59:05,519 --> 00:59:13,039
in in what way well it means that it

1621
00:59:08,798 --> 00:59:15,440
gives it a higher degree of assurance

1622
00:59:13,039 --> 00:59:16,960
to be remembered in the future rather

1623
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:20,079
than go through

1624
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:22,159
the sort of degradation that we think of

1625
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,960
as forgetting

1626
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:24,558
so

1627
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,119
the brain has

1628
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,720
in some ways by default you know

1629
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:29,680
there is forget and actually i would

1630
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:31,439
love to

1631
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,358
i was going to say sleep is relevant for

1632
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,440
memory in three different ways but i'm

1633
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:36,798
going to amend that and say this four

1634
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,079
different ways

1635
00:59:36,798 --> 00:59:40,079
which is learning

1636
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,838
maintaining memorizing

1637
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:48,400
abstraction assimilation

1638
00:59:44,838 --> 00:59:50,719
association and then forgetting which

1639
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:52,400
the last one sounds oxymoronic based on

1640
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:53,439
the form of three but i'll see if i can

1641
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,680
explain

1642
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,519
so sleep after learning then sort of you

1643
00:59:55,679 --> 01:00:01,118
know

1644
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:03,920
sets the that information like amber

1645
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:07,440
in you know in solidification

1646
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,599
the third benefit however is that sleep

1647
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,358
we've learned more recently is much more

1648
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,318
intelligent than we ever gave it credit

1649
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,838
for

1650
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:15,920
sleep doesn't simply just take

1651
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:17,599
individual memories

1652
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:19,200
and strengthen them

1653
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,838
sleep will then

1654
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:25,759
intelligently integrate and cross link

1655
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:27,599
and associate that information together

1656
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:28,880
and it's almost like informational

1657
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,720
alchemy

1658
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:33,680
so that you wake up the next morning

1659
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:36,239
with a revised mind wide web of

1660
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:38,159
associations

1661
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:39,838
and that's probably the reason that you

1662
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:40,838
know you've never been told to stay

1663
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:43,039
awake on a

1664
01:00:40,838 --> 01:00:43,838
problem you know

1665
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:45,440
and

1666
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:47,519
in every language that i've been quiet

1667
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:50,480
about that phrase or very something very

1668
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:51,599
similar seems to exist which means to me

1669
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:54,318
that

1670
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:56,798
this creative associative benefit of

1671
01:00:54,318 --> 01:01:01,519
sleep transcends cultural boundaries it

1672
01:00:56,798 --> 01:01:01,519
is a common experience across humanity

1673
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:06,000
now i should note that i think the

1674
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,079
french translation of that is much

1675
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,559
closer to you um i think you sleep with

1676
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,559
a problem whereas the british you sleep

1677
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:13,839
on a problem the french you sleep with a

1678
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,839
problem i think it says so much about

1679
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:17,838
the romantic difference between the

1680
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:20,960
british and the french but let's let's

1681
01:01:17,838 --> 01:01:22,880
not go there um that's brilliant so such

1682
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,720
a subtle but such a fundamental

1683
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:27,200
difference yeah

1684
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:29,679
yeah goodness me sleep with the problem

1685
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:31,358
yes exactly right

1686
01:01:29,679 --> 01:01:32,239
um

1687
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,000
so

1688
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:37,358
and we can sort of double click on any

1689
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:42,159
one of these and go in into detail but

1690
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:43,199
the fourth i became really enchanted by

1691
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:44,960
about

1692
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:48,239
eight years ago in our research which

1693
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:50,559
was this idea of forgetting

1694
01:01:48,239 --> 01:01:52,798
and i started to

1695
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:56,319
think that forgetting may be the price

1696
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:58,798
that we pay for remembering

1697
01:01:56,318 --> 01:02:02,000
and in that sense

1698
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:03,199
there is an enormous

1699
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:04,838
benefit

1700
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:07,439
to letting

1701
01:02:04,838 --> 01:02:09,838
go you may be thinking that sounds

1702
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:11,358
ridiculous i don't want to forget in

1703
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:13,199
fact my biggest problem is i keep

1704
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,239
forgetting things

1705
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:15,439
but

1706
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:18,719
the brain

1707
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:21,200
it has a fight well we believe has a

1708
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:22,879
finite storage capacity we can't prove

1709
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:23,919
it yet but my suspicion is that that's

1710
01:02:22,880 --> 01:02:25,838
probably true it doesn't have an

1711
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,680
infinite storage capacity it has

1712
01:02:25,838 --> 01:02:30,639
constraints

1713
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:33,038
if that's the case we can't simply go

1714
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:37,679
through life being you know

1715
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:39,760
constantly informational aggregators

1716
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:42,159
unless you know we are programmed to say

1717
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:44,319
we've got a hard drive space of about 85

1718
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:46,239
to 90 years and we're good and we can do

1719
01:02:44,318 --> 01:02:48,079
that maybe that's true i don't think

1720
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:50,959
that's true i think forgetting is an

1721
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,000
incredibly good and useful thing so for

1722
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:52,880
example

1723
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:54,960
you know

1724
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,358
it's not beneficial from an evolutionary

1725
01:02:54,960 --> 01:03:00,720
perspective for me to remember where i

1726
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:02,880
parked my car three years ago

1727
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:05,598
so it's important that i can remember

1728
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:06,960
today's parking spot but i don't want to

1729
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:10,079
have the junk

1730
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:12,639
kind of dna from a memory perspective of

1731
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,880
you know where my i parked my car you

1732
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:16,719
know two years ago um

1733
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,960
now i actually have a in some ways a

1734
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:20,480
problem with forgetting i'm and again

1735
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,280
i'm not trying to sort of be laudatory

1736
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:24,079
but

1737
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:26,000
you know i i tend not to forget too many

1738
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:27,039
things and i don't think that that's a

1739
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:30,000
good thing

1740
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:32,480
and um the there's a wonderful

1741
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,358
neurologist laurea who wrote a book

1742
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:37,920
called the mind of the mnemonicist and

1743
01:03:35,358 --> 01:03:40,558
it was a brilliant book

1744
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,318
both because it was written exquisitely

1745
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,798
but he was studying

1746
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:47,759
these sort of memory savants

1747
01:03:44,798 --> 01:03:49,358
who basically could remember everything

1748
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,520
that he gave them

1749
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:53,519
and he tried to find

1750
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:54,719
a [ __ ] in their armor

1751
01:03:53,519 --> 01:03:57,038
and the first half of the book is

1752
01:03:54,719 --> 01:04:00,000
essentially about him

1753
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,599
seeing how far he can push them before

1754
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:03,760
they fail

1755
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,480
and he never found that place

1756
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,920
he could never find a place where they

1757
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:10,798
stopped

1758
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:13,200
remembering and then in his brilliance

1759
01:04:10,798 --> 01:04:15,599
he turned the question on its head he

1760
01:04:13,199 --> 01:04:17,598
said not what is the benefit of

1761
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:20,160
constantly remembering

1762
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:22,079
but instead what is the detriment

1763
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:24,000
to never forgetting

1764
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:26,240
and when you start to realize his

1765
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:29,519
descriptions of those individuals it's

1766
01:04:26,239 --> 01:04:31,358
probably a life that you would not want

1767
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:33,440
but it's fascinating both from a human

1768
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:34,558
perspective but also ai perspective

1769
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,440
there's a

1770
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:38,880
there's a big challenge in the machine

1771
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,720
learning community of how to build

1772
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,720
systems that are able to remember for

1773
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:45,279
prolonged periods of time

1774
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:47,038
lifelong continuous learning so where

1775
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,519
you build up

1776
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:52,640
information over time so memory is one

1777
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:54,480
of the biggest open problems in uh

1778
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:56,639
in ai and machine learning

1779
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,240
but at the same time the right way to

1780
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:00,159
formulate memory

1781
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:01,519
is actually forgetting

1782
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,358
because

1783
01:05:01,519 --> 01:05:05,519
you have to be exceptionally selective

1784
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,558
at which kind of stuff you remember

1785
01:05:05,519 --> 01:05:08,239
and that's where the step of a

1786
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,079
simulation integration that you're

1787
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:13,199
referring to is really important i mean

1788
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:15,359
we forget most of the things and and the

1789
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:16,639
question is exactly the cost of

1790
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:18,400
forgetting

1791
01:05:16,639 --> 01:05:20,480
at the very edge

1792
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,680
of stuff that could be important or

1793
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:24,240
could not be

1794
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:26,239
how do we remember not those things like

1795
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:28,558
for example

1796
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:29,519
i've uh you know doing a podcast i've

1797
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:31,599
become

1798
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:34,079
cognizant of one feature of my

1799
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:37,519
forgetting that's been problematic

1800
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:40,880
which is i forget names and titles of

1801
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:43,440
books and so on so when i read

1802
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,599
i remember ideas

1803
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,159
i remember quotes

1804
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:50,400
i remember statements and like that's

1805
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:52,960
the space in which i'm thinking

1806
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,680
but when you communicate to others

1807
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,639
you have to say this person in this book

1808
01:05:55,679 --> 01:05:58,480
said that

1809
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:00,960
it's the same thing with uh with like

1810
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,960
andrew huberman is masterful with this

1811
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:05,039
this is important academia remembering

1812
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,720
the authors of a paper and the title of

1813
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:08,960
the paper

1814
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:12,239
as part of remembering the idea

1815
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:14,400
and i've been feeling the cost of not

1816
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:16,078
not being able to naturally remember

1817
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:18,000
those things and so that that's

1818
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:20,079
something i need to sort of work on but

1819
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:22,719
that's an exact with faces

1820
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:24,720
yes very good at faces but not good with

1821
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,239
names so i am exactly like

1822
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:28,798
you and there is you know an

1823
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:30,959
understanding of that in the brain too

1824
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,798
we understand that there is partitioning

1825
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:34,960
of those in terms of the territory of

1826
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:37,119
the brain that takes care of faces and

1827
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:39,838
facts and places and they can be

1828
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:42,160
separate so i will never forget

1829
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:44,880
a face but you know and as i said i

1830
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:47,038
usually forget very little but for some

1831
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:48,640
reason names are

1832
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:50,480
a struggle i think in some ways because

1833
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:52,078
i'm probably just a slightly anxious

1834
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,000
person so when you first meet someone

1835
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,079
which is usually the time when a name is

1836
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:58,239
introduced you know you were saying you

1837
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,960
were sort of anxious maybe about sort of

1838
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:03,199
sitting down with me um but

1839
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:05,440
i find that a little bit

1840
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:06,558
you know activating and so

1841
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:08,079
it's not as though there's anything

1842
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:09,599
wrong with my memory it's just

1843
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,599
the emotional state i'm in when i'm

1844
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,200
first meeting someone yeah you know it's

1845
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:15,760
a little bit perturbing but i will never

1846
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:17,279
forget the face but um i completely

1847
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:19,599
relate to that because i almost don't

1848
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,798
hear uh people's names when they tell me

1849
01:07:19,599 --> 01:07:25,359
because i'm so anxious yeah yeah

1850
01:07:22,798 --> 01:07:27,199
but i i think there's certain quirks of

1851
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:29,440
social interaction

1852
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:31,759
that uh show that you care about the

1853
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:34,159
person that you remember that person

1854
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,400
that they mattered to you they had an

1855
01:07:34,159 --> 01:07:38,558
impact on you and one of the ways to

1856
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,240
show that is you remember their name

1857
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,680
and but that's a quirk to me because

1858
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:44,639
there's

1859
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:46,000
a lot of people i meet have a deep

1860
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:47,199
impact on me

1861
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:49,519
but

1862
01:07:47,199 --> 01:07:51,519
they i can't communicate that unless i

1863
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:52,400
know their name unless i know some of

1864
01:07:51,519 --> 01:07:54,159
the

1865
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,838
um

1866
01:07:54,159 --> 01:07:59,440
details that that we humans seem to use

1867
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:02,239
to communicate that will remember each

1868
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,880
other what i i remember well

1869
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:07,358
is the feeling we shared

1870
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,880
is the experience we shared

1871
01:08:07,358 --> 01:08:11,920
what i don't remember well is the

1872
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,318
detailed labels of of those experiences

1873
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:17,039
and i need to certainly work on that i i

1874
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:20,000
don't know i think it's you know just

1875
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:22,560
allowing yourself to be innate and who

1876
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:24,560
you are is also a beautiful thing too

1877
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:26,798
i'm not suggesting it's not important to

1878
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,199
try and better oneself and

1879
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:31,759
but i also sometimes worry about the

1880
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:34,719
misery that that puts us in but

1881
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:36,560
like you i will

1882
01:08:34,719 --> 01:08:38,960
i do struggle with him but

1883
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,080
i know for the first time when we met in

1884
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:42,640
the lobby

1885
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:44,158
um i know exactly

1886
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,920
what you look like i know that you were

1887
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:47,838
wearing headphones i know the shape and

1888
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,600
the size of those headphones you didn't

1889
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:51,519
have your black jacket on i know exactly

1890
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,520
what the weave of your shirt looked like

1891
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,839
and you know what your shoes look like

1892
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:58,159
and i knew exactly the height of your

1893
01:08:55,838 --> 01:09:01,039
the end of your pants from the top of

1894
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:02,960
your shoes yeah and so those things i

1895
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:04,960
don't forget you know and i can that's

1896
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,640
fascinating remember when people i met

1897
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,279
people you know two years ago and i'll

1898
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,279
say oh yes we met there and um i

1899
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,600
remember you had those fantastic you

1900
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,040
know boots on i thought they were pretty

1901
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,960
great pair of boots you know and they're

1902
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:18,640
like how do you i didn't even remember

1903
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,798
what i was wearing that day yeah it's

1904
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:22,400
fascinating yeah i'm the exact the same

1905
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:23,759
way but you can't

1906
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:25,439
until we have neurolink or something

1907
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:26,880
like that we can't communicate that you

1908
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:28,879
remember all those things i know that's

1909
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:30,798
what i wanted so you have to be able to

1910
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,079
use uh tricks of human communication for

1911
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:36,000
that but so that i mean that's the it

1912
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,158
ultimately is a trick of like which to

1913
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:40,560
remember which to forget right and the

1914
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:43,039
forgetting is so it's so fascinating to

1915
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:45,600
say this i mean it seems to be

1916
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:49,439
deeply connected to that assimilation

1917
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:51,759
process so forgetting you try to fit

1918
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:54,879
all the new stuff into

1919
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:57,198
this big web of the old stuff

1920
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:58,079
and the things that don't fit you throw

1921
01:09:57,198 --> 01:10:00,238
out

1922
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:02,079
i think the assimilation the way i've

1923
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:03,599
been thinking about it with sleep and

1924
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:05,198
it's particularly sort of dream sleep

1925
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,280
that we think can help with this

1926
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:08,238
assimilation

1927
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:11,840
is that

1928
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:14,079
during wake we have one version of

1929
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:15,679
associative processing what i mean by

1930
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:17,039
that is we see the most obvious

1931
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:19,920
connections

1932
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:24,640
so i think of wakefulness

1933
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:27,119
as a google search gone right

1934
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:30,000
whereas i see dream sleep as doing

1935
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:32,238
something very different i think dream

1936
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:33,520
sleep is a little bit like group therapy

1937
01:10:32,238 --> 01:10:36,079
for memories

1938
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:38,640
that everyone gets a name badge and

1939
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:41,519
sleep gathers in all of the individual

1940
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:43,840
pieces of the day and it sort of starts

1941
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,280
to get you to forces you in fact to

1942
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,239
speak to the people not at the front of

1943
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:48,399
the room that you think you've got the

1944
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:49,839
most obvious connection with but to

1945
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:51,359
speak with the people all the way at the

1946
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:53,600
back of the room that at first you think

1947
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:55,759
i've got no obvious connection with them

1948
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:56,480
at all but once you get chatting with

1949
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,159
them

1950
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,158
you learn that you do have a very

1951
01:10:58,158 --> 01:11:02,559
distant non-obvious connection but it's

1952
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:04,319
still a connection not the same

1953
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,199
and it's almost as though you're doing a

1954
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:09,519
google search where you know i input you

1955
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:11,279
know lex friedman and

1956
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,040
it doesn't take me to the first page of

1957
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:15,519
your home site page 20. it takes me to

1958
01:11:13,039 --> 01:11:17,519
page 20 which is about some like field

1959
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,440
hockey game in utah yeah exactly it

1960
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,880
turns out that there actually is a link

1961
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:22,238
if i look at it it's a distant

1962
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,319
non-obvious one

1963
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:26,000
and to me i find that exciting because

1964
01:11:24,319 --> 01:11:27,920
when you fuse things together that

1965
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,079
shouldn't normally go together but when

1966
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:32,319
they do they cause marked advances in

1967
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:34,800
evolutionary fitness it sounds like the

1968
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:37,039
biological basis of creativity

1969
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:38,880
and that's exactly what i think dream

1970
01:11:37,039 --> 01:11:41,039
sleep and the algorithm of dream sleep

1971
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,319
is designed to do you know it's not a

1972
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:47,600
boolean like system where you have

1973
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:50,238
you know the sort of assumptions of true

1974
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:53,920
and false you know maybe it's more fuzzy

1975
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:56,479
logic system and i think rem sleep is a

1976
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,719
perfect environment within which we do

1977
01:11:56,479 --> 01:12:00,238
you know it's almost like memory pinball

1978
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:02,158
you know you get the information that

1979
01:12:00,238 --> 01:12:04,238
you've learned during the day and then

1980
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:06,879
you pull the lever back and you shoot it

1981
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:08,959
up into the attic of your brain

1982
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:11,440
you know this cortex filled with all of

1983
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:13,198
your past historical knowledge and you

1984
01:12:11,439 --> 01:12:14,639
start to bounce it around and see where

1985
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:15,839
one of those things lights up and you

1986
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:17,600
build a new connection there and you

1987
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:19,600
build another one there too you're

1988
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:21,520
developing schemas

1989
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,039
and so in that way i think you could

1990
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,960
argue

1991
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:29,198
you know we dream therefore we are

1992
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,840
yeah so in terms of

1993
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:33,919
this line between learning and thinking

1994
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:36,480
through a new thing

1995
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:38,800
that seems to be deeply connected

1996
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:41,039
there's this

1997
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:43,279
legendary engineer named jim keller who

1998
01:12:41,039 --> 01:12:44,800
keeps yelling at me about this he says

1999
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:46,319
it's very effective

2000
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:48,159
he likes to

2001
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:50,399
for difficult problems

2002
01:12:48,158 --> 01:12:51,759
before bed think about that difficult

2003
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:53,839
problem we're not talking about like

2004
01:12:51,760 --> 01:12:56,640
drama at work or all that kind of stuff

2005
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,760
no like a scientific for him engineering

2006
01:12:56,640 --> 01:13:00,239
problem

2007
01:12:57,760 --> 01:13:00,960
he likes to like intensely think about

2008
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:04,158
it

2009
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:07,039
and to prime his mind yes before sleep

2010
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:08,479
and then go to sleep and then uh he

2011
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:11,039
finds that uh

2012
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:12,959
the next day he's he's able to think

2013
01:13:11,039 --> 01:13:15,519
much clearer and there's new ideas that

2014
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,840
come but also just i guess it's more

2015
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:21,040
well integrated

2016
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:23,679
and sometimes during the process of

2017
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:24,880
like he's able to like wake up

2018
01:13:23,679 --> 01:13:25,679
and

2019
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,840
like

2020
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:29,359
see new insights that's right if he's

2021
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,960
deeply sort of aggressively thinking

2022
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:33,279
through a problem

2023
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:36,158
there's many scientific you know

2024
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:38,079
demonstrations of this you know the

2025
01:13:36,158 --> 01:13:40,719
mendeleev with a periodic table of

2026
01:13:38,079 --> 01:13:43,439
elements you know he was trying for

2027
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:44,198
months to understand i mean talk about

2028
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:47,839
an

2029
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:49,839
ecumenical problem of epic proportions

2030
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:51,920
here's your question today

2031
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,760
you have to understand how all of the

2032
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:56,960
known elements in the universe fit

2033
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:58,960
together in a logical way good luck take

2034
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:01,119
it was non-trivial at the time and he

2035
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:04,000
would try and try he was so obsessed

2036
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:06,559
with it he created playing cards with

2037
01:14:04,000 --> 01:14:08,719
all of the different elements on and

2038
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:11,360
then he would go on these long train

2039
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:13,039
journeys around europe and he would just

2040
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:15,119
sort of deal these cards in front of

2041
01:14:13,039 --> 01:14:16,479
them and he would shuffle them

2042
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:18,960
shuffling and shuffling and he would

2043
01:14:16,479 --> 01:14:21,439
just try to see if he could find what

2044
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:24,158
the answer was and then so the story

2045
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:26,960
goes you know he fell asleep and he had

2046
01:14:24,158 --> 01:14:29,439
a dream and in that dream you know all

2047
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:31,439
of these elements started to dance and

2048
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:34,319
play around and they snapped into a

2049
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:35,519
logical grid you know atomic weights etc

2050
01:14:34,319 --> 01:14:38,880
etc

2051
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,920
and it wasn't his waking brain

2052
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:42,159
that

2053
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,079
solved the problem it was his sleeping

2054
01:14:42,158 --> 01:14:46,799
brain that solved the impenetrable

2055
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:49,119
problem that his waking brain could not

2056
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:51,039
and there's been count you know even in

2057
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:52,640
the arts and in music

2058
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:55,359
some wonderful dreams you know

2059
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:57,760
frankenstein mary shelley's epic gothic

2060
01:14:55,359 --> 01:15:00,319
novel came to her in a dream at lord

2061
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:02,079
byron's home

2062
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:03,359
and then we've got

2063
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:05,920
you know

2064
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:08,158
paul mccartney

2065
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,960
yesterday the song came to him in a

2066
01:15:08,158 --> 01:15:13,039
dream he was uh filming um

2067
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,560
gosh what was the movie um i don't

2068
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:16,238
recall it i should be shocked because

2069
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,679
i'm from liverpool myself

2070
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:20,079
um and

2071
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:23,840
but he was on wimpole street in london

2072
01:15:20,079 --> 01:15:27,039
um and filming and they he came up with

2073
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,880
that song the melody um in his sleep not

2074
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:33,198
to be outdone by the beatles and by the

2075
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:35,199
way let it be um also came from a dream

2076
01:15:33,198 --> 01:15:38,479
that mccartney had people usually give

2077
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:40,559
it you know religious overtones you know

2078
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:42,718
mother mary comes to me speaking words

2079
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:45,280
of wisdom let it be

2080
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:48,319
if you've ever asked who mother mary is

2081
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:50,479
it's not the you know the biblical

2082
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:53,519
content it's his

2083
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:56,079
his mother it's it's it's mary mccartney

2084
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,920
yeah and she came to him in a dream and

2085
01:15:56,079 --> 01:16:01,279
gifted him the song

2086
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:04,960
but the best story i've heard is um not

2087
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:08,639
to be outdone by the beatles the stones

2088
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:10,158
um keith richards uh who i think once

2089
01:16:08,640 --> 01:16:12,560
was suggested that

2090
01:16:10,158 --> 01:16:13,679
who was it was a comedian who was saying

2091
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,080
that

2092
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:18,079
in an interview with rolling stone keith

2093
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:20,640
richards suggested or inferred that

2094
01:16:18,079 --> 01:16:24,640
young kids should not do drugs

2095
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:26,480
and they said well look

2096
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:29,039
young kids can't do drugs because you've

2097
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:29,039
done all of that

2098
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:35,600
but keith richards described

2099
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,719
he would always go to bed with his um

2100
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:39,120
guitar

2101
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:41,439
and a tape recorder

2102
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:42,238
um and then probably who would have a

2103
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:43,759
whole

2104
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:46,000
set of other things in the bed with him

2105
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:48,640
and who knows how many other people but

2106
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:51,039
anyway uh and then he said in his

2107
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,760
autobiography and i'm paraphrasing here

2108
01:16:51,039 --> 01:16:55,039
but

2109
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:57,600
one morning i woke up and i realized

2110
01:16:55,039 --> 01:17:01,119
that the tape had recorded all the way

2111
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:04,480
to the end so i rewound the tape

2112
01:17:01,119 --> 01:17:07,679
and i hit play and there in some kind of

2113
01:17:04,479 --> 01:17:10,158
ghostly form were the opening chords to

2114
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:12,960
satisfaction the most famous successful

2115
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:13,759
rolling stone song of all of all time

2116
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,840
yeah

2117
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:17,840
followed by then 43 minutes of snoring

2118
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:22,880
that riff came to him one of the most

2119
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:24,719
famous riffs in all of rock and roll

2120
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,199
came to him by way of a dream inspired

2121
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:28,640
insight so i think you know

2122
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:30,559
there is

2123
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,320
too many of those anecdotes and we've

2124
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,400
now got the site you know i don't rely

2125
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:36,158
on anecdotes a science we've now done

2126
01:17:34,399 --> 01:17:38,559
the studies in the laboratory and we can

2127
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:40,639
reliably demonstrate that sleep inspires

2128
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:42,960
creativity inspires problem-solving

2129
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:44,800
capacity well the interesting thing is

2130
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:46,560
is it possible to some of the ideas that

2131
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:48,159
you talk about to turn them into a

2132
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,039
protocol that could be practiced

2133
01:17:48,158 --> 01:17:52,960
rigorously so what jim keller

2134
01:17:51,039 --> 01:17:55,760
espouses is

2135
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:56,960
saying not just the fact that sleep

2136
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,480
helps you

2137
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:01,119
increase the creativity

2138
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:02,238
but turn it into a process like

2139
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:04,319
literally

2140
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:05,678
like don't do it accidentally you know

2141
01:18:04,319 --> 01:18:07,840
like

2142
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:09,359
uh like an athlete

2143
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,279
does certain things to optimize their

2144
01:18:09,359 --> 01:18:14,399
performance they have a training routine

2145
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:17,599
they have a regimen of uh

2146
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:19,839
of like cycling and and uh sprints and

2147
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,760
long distance stuff in the same way

2148
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,800
thinking about your

2149
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:26,960
job as an idea generator in engineering

2150
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,960
space it's like this is good for my

2151
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:29,840
performance so like for an hour before

2152
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,158
bed

2153
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:33,039
think through a problem like every night

2154
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:35,359
and then

2155
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:37,198
use sleep to uh

2156
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:39,599
work through that problem i mean that

2157
01:18:37,198 --> 01:18:41,359
he's the first person that i heard like

2158
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:44,320
of the people i really respect that do

2159
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:46,158
like what i do which is like programming

2160
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:47,599
engineering type work

2161
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:49,599
like using

2162
01:18:47,600 --> 01:18:50,640
sleep not accidentally but with a

2163
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,640
purpose

2164
01:18:50,640 --> 01:18:54,079
like using sleep

2165
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,640
you know that's just basically the

2166
01:18:54,079 --> 01:18:58,640
difference between as you said a passive

2167
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,920
approach to it versus

2168
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:02,640
you know an

2169
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,158
an active deterministic or hope for a

2170
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:07,280
deterministic approach to it in other

2171
01:19:04,158 --> 01:19:10,000
words that you are actually trying to

2172
01:19:07,279 --> 01:19:12,719
harness the power of of sleep in a

2173
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:15,198
deliberate way rather than an

2174
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:16,719
unthoughtful way i still think that you

2175
01:19:15,198 --> 01:19:19,359
know mother nature

2176
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:21,600
through it you know 3.6 million years of

2177
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:23,599
evolution has probably got it

2178
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:25,840
mostly figured out in terms of what

2179
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:28,640
information should be uploaded at night

2180
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:31,199
and worked through i think her algorithm

2181
01:19:28,640 --> 01:19:33,119
is probably pretty good at this stage

2182
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:35,439
it's not to suggest though that you know

2183
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:36,960
we can't try to tweak it and nudge it

2184
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:39,678
you know it's a very light hand on the

2185
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:41,439
tiller is is what he's doing i i don't

2186
01:19:39,679 --> 01:19:43,440
think there's anything wrong with that

2187
01:19:41,439 --> 01:19:46,719
you know just like for example for me

2188
01:19:43,439 --> 01:19:49,599
fasting has improved my ability to focus

2189
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:52,239
deeply and productivity significantly

2190
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:54,560
and in that same way

2191
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:56,799
you know it's possible that playing with

2192
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:58,960
these ideas of thinking before bed or

2193
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,320
some hours before better some

2194
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:02,719
playing with different protocols will

2195
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:04,799
have a significant leap over what mother

2196
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:06,880
nature naturally does so if you let your

2197
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,320
body do what it naturally does you may

2198
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:11,840
not achieve the same level of

2199
01:20:08,319 --> 01:20:13,759
performance because mother nature

2200
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:16,400
has not designed us to think deeply

2201
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:18,960
about uh chip design

2202
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:21,039
for uh programming artificial

2203
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:23,359
intelligence systems so well she's

2204
01:20:21,039 --> 01:20:25,519
gifted us the architecture and the

2205
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:27,439
capacity to do that

2206
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:30,320
what we do with that is

2207
01:20:27,439 --> 01:20:31,439
you know is what life's experience

2208
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:34,000
dictates

2209
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:36,479
she gives us the blueprint to do many

2210
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:38,719
you know well if i were to sort of

2211
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:41,198
introspect and self analyze what mother

2212
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:43,679
nature wants me to do i think given my

2213
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:45,198
current lifestyle that i have food in

2214
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,520
the fridge

2215
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:49,439
and a bed to sleep on i think what

2216
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:51,199
mother nature wants me to do is to be

2217
01:20:49,439 --> 01:20:53,599
lazy

2218
01:20:51,198 --> 01:20:55,759
and so i think i'm actually resisting

2219
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,960
mother nature uh

2220
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:58,400
in

2221
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:01,840
because so many of my knees are

2222
01:20:58,399 --> 01:21:03,759
satisfied and so i i'm

2223
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:06,079
i have to resist some of the natural

2224
01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:08,320
forces of the body and the mind when i

2225
01:21:06,079 --> 01:21:09,679
do some of the things i do so there's

2226
01:21:08,319 --> 01:21:11,439
that dance

2227
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:13,520
um you know like i've been thinking

2228
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:15,279
about doing a startup and that's

2229
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:16,880
obviously going against everything that

2230
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:19,039
my body and mind

2231
01:21:16,880 --> 01:21:21,119
are telling me to do because it's going

2232
01:21:19,039 --> 01:21:23,119
to be basically suffering

2233
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:26,238
but the only reason i want as you know

2234
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:27,760
it will be over

2235
01:21:26,238 --> 01:21:30,238
yes

2236
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:31,920
i but nevertheless there's some kind of

2237
01:21:30,238 --> 01:21:33,759
inner drive that wants me to do it and

2238
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,840
then you start to ask a question well

2239
01:21:33,760 --> 01:21:38,320
how do you optimize the things you can't

2240
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:40,159
optimize like sleep like diet like the

2241
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:41,599
people that you surround yourself with

2242
01:21:40,158 --> 01:21:43,519
in order to

2243
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:45,520
maximize happiness and performance and

2244
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:48,320
all those kinds of things without also

2245
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:50,800
over optimizing and that's such an

2246
01:21:48,319 --> 01:21:51,920
interesting idea from

2247
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,320
from a

2248
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:56,960
engineer so

2249
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:58,639
as you may know you don't often

2250
01:21:56,960 --> 01:22:01,359
get that those kinds of ideas from

2251
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:03,920
engineers engineers usually just

2252
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:06,000
don't read books about sleeping

2253
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:08,880
they're usually like the the

2254
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,479
they're not they they're not the

2255
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:11,279
healthiest of people

2256
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:12,879
um

2257
01:22:11,279 --> 01:22:14,399
i think that's changing over time

2258
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,079
especially silicon valley especially the

2259
01:22:14,399 --> 01:22:18,079
tech sector people are starting to

2260
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:20,158
understand what's a healthy lifestyle

2261
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:22,639
but usually they're kind of on the

2262
01:22:20,158 --> 01:22:26,319
insane side especially programmers but

2263
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:28,400
it's nice to hear uh somebody like that

2264
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:31,519
use sleep and use some of the things you

2265
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:32,799
talk about strategically yeah

2266
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:34,960
on purpose

2267
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,079
you know to that idea of

2268
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,039
not just

2269
01:22:36,079 --> 01:22:40,319
trying to use what mother nature gave

2270
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:43,119
but

2271
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:45,519
seeing if you can do something more or

2272
01:22:43,119 --> 01:22:45,519
different

2273
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:51,119
in a conservative mindset

2274
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:52,479
i would then pose the question at what

2275
01:22:51,119 --> 01:22:54,238
cost

2276
01:22:52,479 --> 01:22:57,039
because when you

2277
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:59,678
do something perhaps that deviates from

2278
01:22:57,039 --> 01:23:01,119
the typical pre-programmed

2279
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:03,920
you know

2280
01:23:01,119 --> 01:23:06,559
mother nature's program

2281
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:09,520
i suspect it usually comes at the cost

2282
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:12,400
of something else so maybe he is you

2283
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:14,719
know able to direct and focus

2284
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:17,039
his sleeping cognition

2285
01:23:14,719 --> 01:23:20,158
on those particular topics that will

2286
01:23:17,039 --> 01:23:22,238
gain him better problematic resolution

2287
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:24,238
the next day when he wakes up the

2288
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:27,119
question is though at what cost of the

2289
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:28,399
other things that didn't make it onto

2290
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:29,279
the menu

2291
01:23:28,399 --> 01:23:31,839
of

2292
01:23:29,279 --> 01:23:34,639
the finger buffet of sleep that night

2293
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:35,679
and is it that you don't process the

2294
01:23:34,639 --> 01:23:38,239
emotional

2295
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:40,480
difficulties or events and therefore you

2296
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:43,919
are less emotionally resolved the next

2297
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:46,559
day but you are more problem resolved

2298
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:48,639
the following day and so i always try to

2299
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:51,600
think and

2300
01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:53,440
i truly don't want to sound puritanical

2301
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,120
either about sleep and i think i've come

2302
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:57,198
off that way

2303
01:23:55,119 --> 01:24:00,158
many a time especially when i started

2304
01:23:57,198 --> 01:24:02,079
out in the public

2305
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:04,238
the tone of the book in some ways you

2306
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:06,158
know i look back and think could i have

2307
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:09,759
been a little softer

2308
01:24:06,158 --> 01:24:11,599
and the reason was i i was that way

2309
01:24:09,760 --> 01:24:13,480
back in when i started writing the book

2310
01:24:11,600 --> 01:24:16,480
which was probably something like

2311
01:24:13,479 --> 01:24:18,638
2014 or 15.

2312
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:21,359
sleep was the neglected stepsister in

2313
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:24,400
the health conversation of the day

2314
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:26,479
and i was just so sad to see the amount

2315
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:29,519
of suffering and disease and sickness

2316
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:31,759
that was caused by insufficient sleep

2317
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,760
and for years before i've been you know

2318
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:34,960
doing public speaking and i'd tell

2319
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:36,560
people about the great things that

2320
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,158
happen when you get sleep people would

2321
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,679
say that's fascinating and then they

2322
01:24:38,158 --> 01:24:41,920
would go back and keep doing the same

2323
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,760
thing about not sleeping enough and then

2324
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,119
i realized you can't really speak about

2325
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:47,440
the good things that happen it's like

2326
01:24:45,119 --> 01:24:49,198
the news what bleeds leads and if you

2327
01:24:47,439 --> 01:24:51,119
speak about the alarmingly bad things

2328
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:52,879
that happen people tend to have a

2329
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:55,760
behavioral change

2330
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:58,800
and so the book as a consequence i think

2331
01:24:55,760 --> 01:25:00,639
probably came out a little bit on the

2332
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:03,039
strong side of

2333
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,719
you know trying to convince you know

2334
01:25:03,039 --> 01:25:06,238
people you're trying to help a lot of

2335
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:08,639
people and that's a powerful way to help

2336
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:10,158
a lot of people i would i was genuinely

2337
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:11,679
trying to help people but you know

2338
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:13,920
certainly for some people who for whom

2339
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:15,760
sleep is not does not come easy then it

2340
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:18,480
was probably you know

2341
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:20,320
a tricky book to read too and i think i

2342
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:22,479
i feel more sensitive to those people

2343
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:24,000
now and empathetically connected to them

2344
01:25:22,479 --> 01:25:27,198
um

2345
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,840
so i think the again the point was

2346
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:32,799
simply that i don't mean to sound too

2347
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:34,239
puritanical in in all of this and the

2348
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,800
same way with

2349
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:39,759
you know caffeine and coffee

2350
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,840
i am just a scientist and i am not here

2351
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:45,360
to tell anyone how to live their life

2352
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:48,239
that is not my job at all and life is to

2353
01:25:45,359 --> 01:25:51,439
be lived to a degree and life is to be

2354
01:25:48,238 --> 01:25:54,638
lived if you want to do a startup

2355
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:56,879
all i want to do is empower people with

2356
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:58,960
the understanding of the science of

2357
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:00,639
sleep and then you can make an informed

2358
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,800
choice as to how you want to live your

2359
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:05,679
life and i often no judgement on how

2360
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:07,199
anyone wishes to live their life i just

2361
01:26:05,679 --> 01:26:09,359
want to try and

2362
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:12,238
see if the information that i have about

2363
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:13,679
sleep would alternatively change how you

2364
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:15,759
would think about your life decisions

2365
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:19,520
and if it doesn't no problem and if it

2366
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:21,360
does i hope it's been of use well

2367
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:22,880
maybe this is me trying to justify my

2368
01:26:21,359 --> 01:26:24,719
lifestyle to you

2369
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,319
but

2370
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,000
dr seuss said

2371
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:30,238
you know you're in love when you can't

2372
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:32,639
fall asleep because reality is finally

2373
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:34,479
better than your dreams

2374
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:37,440
i love that quote too

2375
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:40,319
okay

2376
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,919
my sleeping uh schedule is uh

2377
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:45,198
complicated

2378
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:47,440
and it has to do primarily

2379
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:49,519
with the fact that i love

2380
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:52,479
basically everything that i do

2381
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:53,440
and that love takes a form that may not

2382
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:55,678
appear

2383
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:57,759
to be love from the external observer

2384
01:26:55,679 --> 01:27:00,399
perspective because it often includes

2385
01:26:57,760 --> 01:27:02,239
struggle it often includes

2386
01:27:00,399 --> 01:27:04,399
something that looks like stress even

2387
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:06,158
though it's not stress it's like this

2388
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:09,279
excitement it's this

2389
01:27:06,158 --> 01:27:12,319
turmoil and chaos of passion

2390
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:14,158
of struggling with the problem of being

2391
01:27:12,319 --> 01:27:16,479
sad and down

2392
01:27:14,158 --> 01:27:17,759
to the point even depressed of how

2393
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:20,319
difficult the problem is the

2394
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:22,960
disappointment that the last few weeks

2395
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:24,719
and months have been a failure and

2396
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:28,239
self-doubt all that

2397
01:27:24,719 --> 01:27:30,319
mix but i i love it and a part of that

2398
01:27:28,238 --> 01:27:32,158
is sometimes staying up all night

2399
01:27:30,319 --> 01:27:33,119
working on a thing i'm really passionate

2400
01:27:32,158 --> 01:27:35,198
about

2401
01:27:33,119 --> 01:27:37,359
and that means sleep schedules that are

2402
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:38,238
just like

2403
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:39,759
you know

2404
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:42,000
sometimes sleeping during the day

2405
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:44,159
sometimes very often

2406
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:46,000
sleeping very little but taking naps

2407
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:50,479
that are like an hour or two hours or so

2408
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:52,639
on that kind of weird chaos and yeah now

2409
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:55,119
i'll also try to get

2410
01:27:52,639 --> 01:27:57,760
give myself back up i was trying to like

2411
01:27:55,119 --> 01:28:00,399
research yesterday is anybody else

2412
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:02,320
productive wild like this and there's of

2413
01:28:00,399 --> 01:28:04,638
course a lot of anecdotal evidence and

2414
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:06,238
some of it

2415
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:08,560
could be just narratives that people

2416
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:10,479
have told to the public when in reality

2417
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:13,039
they sleep way more but there's a bunch

2418
01:28:10,479 --> 01:28:15,198
of people that

2419
01:28:13,039 --> 01:28:17,119
you know have not are famous for not

2420
01:28:15,198 --> 01:28:19,519
sleeping much so

2421
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:21,679
uh on the topic of naps

2422
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:24,800
uh this i read this a long time ago and

2423
01:28:21,679 --> 01:28:26,239
i checked this churchill was big on

2424
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:29,039
big naps

2425
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:31,359
and is actually just reading more about

2426
01:28:29,039 --> 01:28:33,039
winston churchill's sleep schedule is

2427
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:36,079
very much like mine

2428
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:38,639
so i basically want to give myself the

2429
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:40,639
opportunity to at night to stay up all

2430
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:43,520
night if i want to

2431
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:45,679
and a good nap is a big part of that in

2432
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:48,800
the late evening like how often does

2433
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:51,359
this destroy social life completely but

2434
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:53,679
i i'll often take a nap in the late

2435
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:56,479
afternoon or the evening and that sets

2436
01:28:53,679 --> 01:28:59,440
me if i want to stay up all night yeah

2437
01:28:56,479 --> 01:29:01,359
and things like that like uh the i've

2438
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:03,839
read that nikola tesla slept only two

2439
01:29:01,359 --> 01:29:05,119
hours a night edison the same three

2440
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:07,199
hours

2441
01:29:05,119 --> 01:29:10,238
but he actually did uh the polyphasic

2442
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:11,279
sleep like where's just a bunch of naps

2443
01:29:10,238 --> 01:29:13,039
what

2444
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:16,559
can you say

2445
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:18,800
about this madness of love and passion

2446
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:21,360
of loving everything you do

2447
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:23,199
and uh the chaos of sleep that might

2448
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:27,119
result in

2449
01:29:23,198 --> 01:29:30,079
i love the seuss quote um and

2450
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:30,880
i've had that experience too like you

2451
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:34,559
i

2452
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:36,960
adore what i do you know if

2453
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:39,120
if someone you know gave you you know

2454
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:41,198
enough money to to live the rest of your

2455
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:43,359
life you know i've got a roof above my

2456
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:45,198
head rice and beans on the table um and

2457
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:47,359
they said you don't have to work anymore

2458
01:29:45,198 --> 01:29:50,238
i would do nothing different i i would

2459
01:29:47,359 --> 01:29:52,799
do exactly you know

2460
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:55,919
this sounds a little crass and i hope it

2461
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:55,920
doesn't sound this way but

2462
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:03,119
being a scientist

2463
01:29:59,679 --> 01:30:06,840
is not what i do it's who i am

2464
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:06,840
when that's the case

2465
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:11,039
sleep working out

2466
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:13,840
showering and eating

2467
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:15,679
are the things that i do in between

2468
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:16,880
my love of fur

2469
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:18,639
with sleep

2470
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:20,800
yeah i fell for sleep like a blind

2471
01:30:18,639 --> 01:30:23,119
roofer

2472
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,119
and

2473
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:32,080
and it was a love affair that started 20

2474
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:33,039
years ago and i remain utterly besotted

2475
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:35,600
today

2476
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:37,279
it's the most beguiling thing

2477
01:30:35,600 --> 01:30:39,360
in the world to me

2478
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:41,439
and i could easily and i have you know

2479
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:43,039
it's kept me up at night

2480
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:44,719
when my mind is fizzing with

2481
01:30:43,039 --> 01:30:47,279
experimental ideas or i think i've got a

2482
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:49,119
new hypothesis or theory

2483
01:30:47,279 --> 01:30:52,158
i will struggle with sleep

2484
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:54,639
i really will it it doesn't come easy to

2485
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:56,000
me because my mind is just so on fire

2486
01:30:54,639 --> 01:31:00,560
with those

2487
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:00,560
ideas so i understand the the struggle

2488
01:31:01,198 --> 01:31:07,678
but you know i couldn't advocate from a

2489
01:31:05,279 --> 01:31:10,639
scientific perspective the schedule

2490
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:12,960
because the science just doesn't

2491
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:14,880
you know i would feel

2492
01:31:12,960 --> 01:31:15,840
as though i'm doing you a disservice to

2493
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,319
say

2494
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,199
it's okay you know that that won't come

2495
01:31:18,319 --> 01:31:21,759
with

2496
01:31:19,198 --> 01:31:23,839
some blast radius some you know health

2497
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:25,600
consequences you know you can add

2498
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:28,800
margaret thatcher and ronald reagan to

2499
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:31,120
that list too both of them were very

2500
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:32,880
you know proud chess beaters of how

2501
01:31:31,119 --> 01:31:35,279
little sleep that they get thatcher said

2502
01:31:32,880 --> 01:31:37,840
four hours reagan something similar you

2503
01:31:35,279 --> 01:31:39,359
know and i knowing the links that we now

2504
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,199
know between sleep and alzheimer's

2505
01:31:39,359 --> 01:31:43,599
disease i've often wondered whether it

2506
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:45,678
was coincidental then that both of them

2507
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,600
died of the terrible disease of

2508
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:49,840
alzheimer's meaning you know maybe it

2509
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:51,520
doesn't get you by way of you know being

2510
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:52,960
popped out of the gene pool in a car

2511
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,600
accident because you had a microsleep at

2512
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,560
the wheel at age 32 or it doesn't get

2513
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:01,520
you at

2514
01:31:56,560 --> 01:32:04,159
42 with you know heart attack or even 52

2515
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:06,400
with cancer or a stroke maybe it gets

2516
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:08,238
you in your 70s yeah i think the elastic

2517
01:32:06,399 --> 01:32:10,638
band of sleep deprivation can stretch

2518
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:13,599
only so far before it snaps

2519
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:15,359
and it ultimately seems to snap you know

2520
01:32:13,600 --> 01:32:17,760
nicole tesla uh

2521
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:19,759
i think he um

2522
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:22,639
goes to see he i think died of a

2523
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:24,719
coronary thrombosis i believe

2524
01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:26,159
and there was a wonderful study done out

2525
01:32:24,719 --> 01:32:28,079
of harvard where they took a group of

2526
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:30,079
people who had no signs of

2527
01:32:28,079 --> 01:32:31,679
cardiovascular disease

2528
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:32,880
and what they found is that when they

2529
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,359
tracked them

2530
01:32:32,880 --> 01:32:36,639
for years afterwards

2531
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:38,559
they were completely healthy to begin

2532
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:40,800
with those people who are getting less

2533
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,400
than six hours of sleep ended up having

2534
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,000
a 300

2535
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:46,479
increased risk of developing

2536
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:48,319
calcification of the coronary artery

2537
01:32:46,479 --> 01:32:49,279
which is the major

2538
01:32:48,319 --> 01:32:51,679
sort of

2539
01:32:49,279 --> 01:32:53,519
corridor of life for your heart when

2540
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:55,679
someone says you know he died of a

2541
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:58,000
massive coronary it's because of a

2542
01:32:55,679 --> 01:33:00,000
blockade of the coronary artery

2543
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,600
you know and and tesla you know passed

2544
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,238
away from

2545
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:06,159
a coronary thrombosis we also know that

2546
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:07,919
insufficient sleep is linked to numerous

2547
01:33:06,158 --> 01:33:10,319
mental health issues we know that

2548
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:12,158
churchill had a wicked battle with

2549
01:33:10,319 --> 01:33:13,759
depression gosh my goodness he used to

2550
01:33:12,158 --> 01:33:14,960
call it black dog that would come and

2551
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,800
visit him

2552
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:19,359
and i think many of his paintings he was

2553
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:22,239
exquisite painter but some of them would

2554
01:33:19,359 --> 01:33:24,479
depict his darkness with depression as

2555
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:24,479
well

2556
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,480
you know edison is interesting people

2557
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:30,158
have argued that he would short sleep

2558
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:31,599
and he didn't put much value in sleep

2559
01:33:30,158 --> 01:33:33,359
whether or not that's true we don't know

2560
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:34,560
but he was a habitual nappy you're right

2561
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:36,319
during the day i've got some great

2562
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:38,560
pictures of him on his inventor's bench

2563
01:33:36,319 --> 01:33:41,359
taking a nap in fact i believe he set up

2564
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:42,719
nap cops around his house yeah so he

2565
01:33:41,359 --> 01:33:44,639
could nap

2566
01:33:42,719 --> 01:33:46,319
but what we also know a study again

2567
01:33:44,639 --> 01:33:48,639
coming out of harvard just

2568
01:33:46,319 --> 01:33:50,639
a couple of months ago demonstrated very

2569
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:52,960
clearly that polyphasic sleep is

2570
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:55,359
associated with worse physical outcomes

2571
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:58,399
worth cognitive outcomes and especially

2572
01:33:55,359 --> 01:34:00,399
worse mood outcomes so from that sense

2573
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:02,719
you know sleeping like a baby is not

2574
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:03,679
perfect for adults

2575
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:05,679
there's a

2576
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:06,800
fascinating dance here

2577
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:10,079
of uh

2578
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:13,119
the mean and the extreme like the

2579
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:16,079
the average and the high performers

2580
01:34:13,119 --> 01:34:16,079
so i um

2581
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:22,880
this this gets to like the meaning of

2582
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:24,079
life kind of discussion but

2583
01:34:22,880 --> 01:34:27,199
let's go then

2584
01:34:24,079 --> 01:34:28,960
so well and also happiness so

2585
01:34:27,198 --> 01:34:32,000
when studying sleep and we're studying

2586
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:35,840
anything like diet and exercise i think

2587
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:39,679
you have to really get a lot more data

2588
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:39,679
about individuals to make

2589
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:44,800
a conclusive statement that's when

2590
01:34:42,399 --> 01:34:46,960
people talk about like is meat red meat

2591
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,119
good for your bad for you right

2592
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,560
it's just so often correlated with other

2593
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:53,118
life decisions

2594
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,080
when you choose to eat meat or not

2595
01:34:53,118 --> 01:34:55,599
my

2596
01:34:54,079 --> 01:34:57,118
my sense

2597
01:34:55,600 --> 01:35:00,800
is that

2598
01:34:57,118 --> 01:35:04,319
whatever life decisions you make if they

2599
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:06,320
reduce stress and lead to happiness

2600
01:35:04,319 --> 01:35:08,399
that's also going to be a big boost that

2601
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:10,399
needs to be integrated into the plots in

2602
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:12,238
the science right so

2603
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:16,559
the i'll give you an example of somebody

2604
01:35:12,238 --> 01:35:20,158
who is unarguably seen as unhealthy

2605
01:35:16,560 --> 01:35:20,960
my friend mr david goggins

2606
01:35:20,158 --> 01:35:23,920
so

2607
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:26,158
he's clearly obviously almost on purpose

2608
01:35:23,920 --> 01:35:29,279
destroying his body

2609
01:35:26,158 --> 01:35:32,638
like and to say that he's doing the

2610
01:35:29,279 --> 01:35:34,079
wrong thing or the unhealthy thing

2611
01:35:32,639 --> 01:35:35,359
feels

2612
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:36,960
feels like

2613
01:35:35,359 --> 01:35:38,238
feels wrong yeah

2614
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,560
and

2615
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:42,479
but i'm not sure exactly in which way he

2616
01:35:40,560 --> 01:35:44,400
feels wrong one of the things i'm

2617
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:46,158
bothered by and

2618
01:35:44,399 --> 01:35:48,238
again i apologize for the therapy

2619
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:50,879
sessions uh

2620
01:35:48,238 --> 01:35:53,118
a framework of this but

2621
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:56,960
i'm bothered by

2622
01:35:53,118 --> 01:36:01,279
the fact that a lot of people tell me

2623
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,279
or david that they're doing things wrong

2624
01:36:02,079 --> 01:36:06,559
a lot of people in my life when they see

2625
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:09,119
me not sleep

2626
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:11,440
they'll tell me to sleep more

2627
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:12,158
now they're correct

2628
01:36:11,439 --> 01:36:14,399
but

2629
01:36:12,158 --> 01:36:16,319
one fundamental aspect that i'd like to

2630
01:36:14,399 --> 01:36:20,000
complain about

2631
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:22,319
is not enough people almost nobody

2632
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:25,760
especially people that care for me

2633
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:27,920
will come to me and say

2634
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:30,960
you have a dream

2635
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:30,960
work harder

2636
01:36:31,039 --> 01:36:33,279
like

2637
01:36:34,639 --> 01:36:39,520
it's like

2638
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:43,359
the healthy thing should be a component

2639
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:45,119
of a life well lived right but not um

2640
01:36:43,359 --> 01:36:47,359
not everything and i don't know what to

2641
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:49,118
do with that because uh you certainly

2642
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:51,279
don't want to espouse and just like you

2643
01:36:49,118 --> 01:36:54,158
said when you were working in your book

2644
01:36:51,279 --> 01:36:56,399
there is uh a belief you know

2645
01:36:54,158 --> 01:36:58,879
sleep was a secondary citizen in in the

2646
01:36:56,399 --> 01:37:01,118
full spectrum of what's a healthy life

2647
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:03,840
but at the same time i'm bothered by in

2648
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:06,238
silicon valley and all these kinds of

2649
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:08,480
uh work environments that i get to work

2650
01:37:06,238 --> 01:37:11,118
with with engineers is there's

2651
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:13,599
to me too much focus on work-life

2652
01:37:11,118 --> 01:37:13,599
balance

2653
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,840
what that usually starts meaning is like

2654
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:19,439
yeah yeah of course it's good to have a

2655
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,440
social life it's good to have a family

2656
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:23,759
it's good to it's good to

2657
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:26,000
eat well and sleep well but we should

2658
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:27,520
also discover our passion we should also

2659
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:30,560
give our chance

2660
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:33,679
to uh give give ourself a chance to work

2661
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:36,800
our ass off towards a dream

2662
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:39,118
and make mistakes and take big risks

2663
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,600
that in the short term seem to sacrifice

2664
01:37:39,118 --> 01:37:43,839
health and i think you know you to come

2665
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:46,079
back to how you started about david

2666
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,440
goggins who i've never met but who i

2667
01:37:46,079 --> 01:37:50,000
admire

2668
01:37:47,439 --> 01:37:51,678
incredibly and have an immense reverence

2669
01:37:50,000 --> 01:37:52,880
for the man um

2670
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:55,199
you said

2671
01:37:52,880 --> 01:37:58,400
two things is it

2672
01:37:55,198 --> 01:37:59,759
is it wrong to do those things

2673
01:37:58,399 --> 01:38:02,079
to yourself

2674
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,600
and is it unhealthy to do those things

2675
01:38:02,079 --> 01:38:06,158
to yourself

2676
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,600
i disagree with the former and i agree

2677
01:38:06,158 --> 01:38:09,920
with the latter

2678
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,920
so from a health biological medicine

2679
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:13,920
perspective

2680
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:15,840
sleeping in the way that you know you've

2681
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:17,440
described or that other people may be

2682
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:18,960
sleeping in terms of insufficient

2683
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:21,359
amounts

2684
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:24,319
you know science now to your point too

2685
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:26,238
about inter-individual differences

2686
01:38:24,319 --> 01:38:29,679
usually when i see a bar graph and a

2687
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:32,079
mean i usually say show me your variance

2688
01:38:29,679 --> 01:38:34,560
yeah i want to see your variants in

2689
01:38:32,079 --> 01:38:36,399
other words show me the distribution of

2690
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:38,400
that effect how many people were below

2691
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:40,079
the mean how many is it all tightly

2692
01:38:38,399 --> 01:38:42,638
clustered around this one thing so it's

2693
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:44,399
a very robust effect or was this huge

2694
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:45,840
fan of effect where for some people

2695
01:38:44,399 --> 01:38:47,519
there was no effect at all on other

2696
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,880
people there was a whopping effect and

2697
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,600
everything in between

2698
01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:54,319
so i don't discount into individual

2699
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,119
variability

2700
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:56,719
but

2701
01:38:55,118 --> 01:38:58,479
and i will come back to those two points

2702
01:38:56,719 --> 01:39:01,039
about is it wrong and is it unhealthy in

2703
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:02,479
just a second when it comes to sleep we

2704
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:04,880
have found huge amounts of

2705
01:39:02,479 --> 01:39:07,118
inter-individual differences in your

2706
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:09,679
response to a lack of sleep

2707
01:39:07,118 --> 01:39:11,039
but one of the fascinating things so

2708
01:39:09,679 --> 01:39:13,600
let's say that i take you and we're

2709
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:16,800
going to measure your attention your

2710
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:19,280
emotion your mood your blood pressure

2711
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,960
your blood sugar glucose regulation your

2712
01:39:19,279 --> 01:39:22,639
autonomic nervous system and your

2713
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:24,800
different gene expression let's say i'm

2714
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:27,199
just going to measure a whole you know

2715
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:28,639
kaleidoscope of different outcomes brain

2716
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:30,479
and body

2717
01:39:28,639 --> 01:39:32,639
and i find that on our measure of

2718
01:39:30,479 --> 01:39:35,519
cognition on your attentional ability to

2719
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:37,279
focus you are very resilient you just

2720
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:40,719
don't show any impairment at all even

2721
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:42,719
after being awake for 36 hours straight

2722
01:39:40,719 --> 01:39:44,639
does that mean that you are resilient in

2723
01:39:42,719 --> 01:39:46,319
all of those other domains as well the

2724
01:39:44,639 --> 01:39:48,800
answer is no you're not

2725
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:50,000
so you can be resilient in one

2726
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:52,800
but

2727
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:55,279
very vulnerable in another and we've

2728
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:58,320
we've not found anyone who isn't at

2729
01:39:55,279 --> 01:39:59,840
least vulnerable in one of those domains

2730
01:39:58,319 --> 01:40:02,079
meaning that

2731
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:03,920
it's somewhat safe to say that

2732
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:07,039
not getting sufficient sleep will lead

2733
01:40:03,920 --> 01:40:09,279
to some kind of impairment in any one

2734
01:40:07,039 --> 01:40:10,399
given individual it may not be the same

2735
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:12,719
impermanent

2736
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:14,799
but it's likely to be an impairment but

2737
01:40:12,719 --> 01:40:17,600
to come back to the question i think

2738
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:19,679
it's wrong to tell anyone that it's

2739
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:21,840
wrong to do what they're doing even if

2740
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:23,600
they are compromising their sleep even

2741
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:26,000
if they're compromising their mental

2742
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:28,320
health you know as long as they're not

2743
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,920
hurting anyone else

2744
01:40:28,319 --> 01:40:31,920
then i think

2745
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,880
the answer is that's that person's

2746
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,399
choice

2747
01:40:32,880 --> 01:40:36,960
yeah but that's that person i'd like to

2748
01:40:34,399 --> 01:40:39,118
push back further so you see the way you

2749
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:41,679
kind of said it

2750
01:40:39,118 --> 01:40:43,118
yes you're absolutely right

2751
01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:45,279
but

2752
01:40:43,118 --> 01:40:48,639
i would like to say a stronger statement

2753
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:51,118
which is you should let go of that

2754
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:53,359
judgment of somebody is wrong

2755
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:55,839
and allow yourself to be inspired by the

2756
01:40:53,359 --> 01:40:57,039
great heights they have reached

2757
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:59,360
so

2758
01:40:57,039 --> 01:41:01,679
take yourself out of the seat of being a

2759
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:04,319
judger of what is healthy and not and

2760
01:41:01,679 --> 01:41:06,960
appreciate the greatness of a particular

2761
01:41:04,319 --> 01:41:09,198
human you you watch the olympics the

2762
01:41:06,960 --> 01:41:11,600
kind of things that some athletes do to

2763
01:41:09,198 --> 01:41:13,919
reach the very heights

2764
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,880
the olympics are taking years off their

2765
01:41:13,920 --> 01:41:16,880
life

2766
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:19,840
they they suffer depression after the

2767
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:21,679
olympics often there it's the physiology

2768
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,279
disastrous yeah everything their

2769
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:26,639
personal life there's

2770
01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:29,198
their psychology their physiology

2771
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:32,400
um everything it's a giant mess so the

2772
01:41:29,198 --> 01:41:34,799
question is about life

2773
01:41:32,399 --> 01:41:35,599
you know healthy

2774
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:39,039
now

2775
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:41,039
means you know longevity

2776
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:42,479
quality of life over a prolonged period

2777
01:41:41,039 --> 01:41:44,158
of time

2778
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:47,359
you know optimal performance over a

2779
01:41:44,158 --> 01:41:49,198
prolonged period of time but to me

2780
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:52,079
beauty

2781
01:41:49,198 --> 01:41:53,919
is reaching great heights

2782
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:56,079
and there's a dance there

2783
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:59,118
that sometimes reaching great heights

2784
01:41:56,079 --> 01:42:00,399
requires sacrifice of health and not

2785
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:02,079
like

2786
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:04,158
a calculation where you sat down on a

2787
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:06,399
sheet of paper and say i'm going to take

2788
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:09,198
seven years off my life for an olympic

2789
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:10,960
gold medal right no it requires more

2790
01:42:09,198 --> 01:42:12,638
chaotic journey

2791
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:14,158
that that doesn't do that kind of

2792
01:42:12,639 --> 01:42:15,920
calculus and i just want to kind of

2793
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:17,920
speak to the

2794
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:20,960
in the culture that struggles of what is

2795
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:23,520
healthy and not we want to be able to uh

2796
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:26,319
speak to what is healthy and at the same

2797
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:29,760
time be inspired by the great heights

2798
01:42:26,319 --> 01:42:33,439
that humans reach no matter how healthy

2799
01:42:29,760 --> 01:42:34,880
or unhealthy they uh they live yeah i

2800
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:36,559
agree with that i think if that's a flag

2801
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,319
you're hoisting i will definitely salute

2802
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,159
it because it really depends you know

2803
01:42:38,319 --> 01:42:41,519
what are you trying to optimize for in

2804
01:42:40,158 --> 01:42:42,799
your life

2805
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:45,520
and if you are

2806
01:42:42,800 --> 01:42:48,000
i think the only danger potentially with

2807
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,639
that mindset is that

2808
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:53,439
if you look at many of the studies of

2809
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:56,239
old age and end of life

2810
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:57,198
most people say i never look back on my

2811
01:42:56,238 --> 01:42:58,959
life

2812
01:42:57,198 --> 01:43:01,039
and

2813
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:04,480
wish i worked harder

2814
01:43:01,039 --> 01:43:06,479
i wish instead i'd spent more time

2815
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:08,879
with family friends

2816
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:11,198
and engaged in that aspect now i'm not

2817
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:13,199
saying though coming back to your point

2818
01:43:11,198 --> 01:43:15,839
that that is the standard rubric for

2819
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:17,678
everyone i don't believe it is too and

2820
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:19,920
there are many things that you and i are

2821
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:22,239
both benefiting from today even in the

2822
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:24,880
field of medicine

2823
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:26,399
where people have sacrificed their own

2824
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:29,039
longevity

2825
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:31,118
for the quest of solving a particular

2826
01:43:29,039 --> 01:43:34,880
medical problem

2827
01:43:31,118 --> 01:43:34,880
and they died

2828
01:43:35,198 --> 01:43:39,439
quicker because of their commitment

2829
01:43:37,679 --> 01:43:41,199
because they wished to try and solve

2830
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:43,759
that problem in their pursuit of

2831
01:43:41,198 --> 01:43:46,559
greatness scientifically and i now

2832
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:48,320
benefit am i grateful that they did that

2833
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:50,800
incredibly grateful

2834
01:43:48,319 --> 01:43:53,439
you know it's a simpler demonstration of

2835
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:54,400
is this if tonight at 4 am in the

2836
01:43:53,439 --> 01:43:55,759
morning

2837
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:57,759
i have

2838
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:59,679
a ruptured appendix

2839
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:02,079
i have an appendicitis

2840
01:43:59,679 --> 01:44:03,679
i am incredibly grateful that there is

2841
01:44:02,079 --> 01:44:06,319
an emergency

2842
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:08,560
team that will take me to the hospital

2843
01:44:06,319 --> 01:44:10,639
at 4am in the morning they are awake

2844
01:44:08,560 --> 01:44:12,239
they're not sleeping and they save my

2845
01:44:10,639 --> 01:44:14,000
life

2846
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:16,718
and that is the

2847
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:19,279
that's part of what their life's mission

2848
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:20,399
and quest is and they saved another's

2849
01:44:19,279 --> 01:44:22,719
life by

2850
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:24,638
in some ways shaving a little of their

2851
01:44:22,719 --> 01:44:27,920
own off

2852
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:30,480
so i don't take i have no umbrage uh

2853
01:44:27,920 --> 01:44:32,399
with that mentality at all i think you

2854
01:44:30,479 --> 01:44:34,879
just have to be very clear about what

2855
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:37,839
you're optimizing for

2856
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:39,600
and my worry is that most people fall

2857
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:42,159
into the rat race

2858
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:44,320
and they never actually ask the question

2859
01:44:42,158 --> 01:44:46,719
why am i doing this if you're just

2860
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:49,599
working nine to five

2861
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:51,920
or uh and you allow that nine to five to

2862
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:54,079
stretch into much longer but it's

2863
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:56,800
nevertheless a job that's kind of like

2864
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:58,000
wears you down that's one thing another

2865
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,719
thing is when

2866
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:02,960
it is a like you're

2867
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:04,719
it's a it's a dream

2868
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:05,920
it's a life mission accomplish and and

2869
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:08,399
for that

2870
01:45:05,920 --> 01:45:10,319
i think as long as you know

2871
01:45:08,399 --> 01:45:12,238
what it is that you could be doing to

2872
01:45:10,319 --> 01:45:14,079
yourself and you are comfortable and

2873
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:14,799
a-okay with that

2874
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:17,679
i

2875
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:21,039
this i have no problem with that at all

2876
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:23,118
again as i said as a scientist i cannot

2877
01:45:21,039 --> 01:45:25,039
should not and will not tell anyone what

2878
01:45:23,118 --> 01:45:28,000
they should do with their life all i

2879
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:31,600
want you to be able to do is say okay

2880
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:34,639
now i understand more about the

2881
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:36,400
previously these were the you know

2882
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:38,159
known unknowns and these were the

2883
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:41,439
unknown unknowns

2884
01:45:38,158 --> 01:45:43,679
and now i am slightly more cognizant i

2885
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:46,319
have more knowns than

2886
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:48,719
than i had before

2887
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:51,840
regarding my sleep and my health knowing

2888
01:45:48,719 --> 01:45:53,760
that information do i still choose

2889
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,960
to make this decision

2890
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:57,840
and

2891
01:45:54,960 --> 01:45:59,760
if that's what i offered

2892
01:45:57,840 --> 01:46:01,600
then i think i've done my job that's all

2893
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:04,800
i want to offer is just added

2894
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:07,840
information into the decision algorithm

2895
01:46:04,800 --> 01:46:10,239
and what you end up choosing as an

2896
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:12,560
output of that algorithm has nothing to

2897
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:14,879
do with me it's not my business and i

2898
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,560
will never judge anyone for it and as i

2899
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,560
said i'm immensely grateful for people

2900
01:46:16,560 --> 01:46:20,639
who have sacrificed

2901
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,480
much in their lives to give me what i

2902
01:46:20,639 --> 01:46:24,560
have so you're saying as long as the

2903
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:25,359
sacrifice sort of grounded in knowledge

2904
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,679
of

2905
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:29,359
you know what the sacrifice is that that

2906
01:46:27,679 --> 01:46:31,359
sleep is important and that you're

2907
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:33,439
comfortable with it that is it is your

2908
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:36,079
conscious choice rather than feeling as

2909
01:46:33,439 --> 01:46:38,638
though you're trapped or that you are

2910
01:46:36,079 --> 01:46:41,198
just you haven't thought about it and

2911
01:46:38,639 --> 01:46:43,039
you know you start that job at age 32

2912
01:46:41,198 --> 01:46:45,039
and then you wake up the next morning

2913
01:46:43,039 --> 01:46:46,880
and you're 65 and you think where did my

2914
01:46:45,039 --> 01:46:48,960
life go what was i doing

2915
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:51,600
that to me i would feel i would want to

2916
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:53,359
hug you and i would say i'm so i'm just

2917
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:56,239
so and i'm not sending i don't want to

2918
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:58,960
sound belittling here at all

2919
01:46:56,238 --> 01:47:00,559
i would just not wish that for you i

2920
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,480
would wish that you

2921
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,360
could have

2922
01:47:02,479 --> 01:47:04,718
you know

2923
01:47:03,359 --> 01:47:06,799
thought about what it was that you're

2924
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:09,359
doing and not have that regret yeah so i

2925
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:11,199
guess i'm uh this is for you the

2926
01:47:09,359 --> 01:47:13,279
listener i'm coming out of the closet

2927
01:47:11,198 --> 01:47:15,359
here a little bit the fact that i enjoy

2928
01:47:13,279 --> 01:47:18,880
the madness i live in so please do not

2929
01:47:15,359 --> 01:47:21,279
criticize me embrace me i i understand

2930
01:47:18,880 --> 01:47:23,039
the sacrifices i'm making i enjoy

2931
01:47:21,279 --> 01:47:25,039
sleeping on the floor when i'm

2932
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:26,960
passionately programming all night and

2933
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:28,560
just pass out on

2934
01:47:26,960 --> 01:47:31,920
on on the carpet

2935
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:33,280
i i love this life okay so it's it's uh

2936
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,199
it but it's definitely something i think

2937
01:47:33,279 --> 01:47:37,599
about that

2938
01:47:35,198 --> 01:47:39,198
there's a balance of strike uh

2939
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,239
where i just want you to have as much of

2940
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:42,879
it though

2941
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:42,879
of life

2942
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:49,198
see

2943
01:47:46,079 --> 01:47:51,039
quality of life is important

2944
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:53,919
i should have said i want you to have as

2945
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:57,279
much high quality life and if high

2946
01:47:53,920 --> 01:48:01,118
quality of life means

2947
01:47:57,279 --> 01:48:04,158
i spend five decades on this planet

2948
01:48:01,118 --> 01:48:07,839
but yet in that time i am thrilled every

2949
01:48:04,158 --> 01:48:09,439
day i'm turned on every day by what i do

2950
01:48:07,840 --> 01:48:10,639
and i

2951
01:48:09,439 --> 01:48:14,079
reveled

2952
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:16,159
in this thing called my life's work

2953
01:48:14,079 --> 01:48:19,359
i think that that is a

2954
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:21,359
50-year journey of absolute

2955
01:48:19,359 --> 01:48:23,599
delight and fulfillment that you should

2956
01:48:21,359 --> 01:48:23,599
take

2957
01:48:24,319 --> 01:48:28,799
i i think about my death all the time i

2958
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:31,439
meditate on death

2959
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:34,880
i'm okay to die today

2960
01:48:31,439 --> 01:48:37,439
so to me longevity is not um

2961
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:40,000
it's not it's not a significant goal i'm

2962
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:42,399
so happy to be alive

2963
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:45,760
i don't even think it would suck to die

2964
01:48:42,399 --> 01:48:48,319
uh today i i'm i'm as afraid of it today

2965
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:50,320
as i will be in 50 years

2966
01:48:48,319 --> 01:48:53,118
i don't want to die as much today as i

2967
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:54,880
will in 50 years there's uh

2968
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:57,198
there's of course all these experiences

2969
01:48:54,880 --> 01:48:59,840
i would like to have but

2970
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:02,960
i'm everything's already amazing it's

2971
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:06,480
like the lego movie so i i don't know so

2972
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:08,480
i to me i just want to keep doing this

2973
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:10,559
and um

2974
01:49:08,479 --> 01:49:12,718
there's there's of course

2975
01:49:10,560 --> 01:49:15,760
things that could affect you know like

2976
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:18,158
you mentioned dementia and these uh

2977
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:21,199
deterioration of the the mind or the

2978
01:49:18,158 --> 01:49:23,679
body that can significantly affect

2979
01:49:21,198 --> 01:49:26,158
the uh the quality of life right and so

2980
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:27,679
you want to uh as you're aware of that

2981
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:30,559
and you know that's the price you pay

2982
01:49:27,679 --> 01:49:31,279
for the entry of into this magical you

2983
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:32,960
know

2984
01:49:31,279 --> 01:49:35,359
kingdom that you are experiencing which

2985
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:37,840
is a lovely thing you know i i feel

2986
01:49:35,359 --> 01:49:40,158
privileged too to i can't believe the

2987
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:41,440
life that i live it's

2988
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:43,598
incredible

2989
01:49:41,439 --> 01:49:46,000
and just like you i don't

2990
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:48,880
i do i do i think about mortality a

2991
01:49:46,000 --> 01:49:51,520
great deal i think a lot about death but

2992
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:53,760
i don't worry about

2993
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,920
death i i probably

2994
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:58,320
with the exception of the potential pain

2995
01:49:55,920 --> 01:50:00,158
that comes before it that some people

2996
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:03,679
many people can't suffer

2997
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:07,279
that maybe concerns me but i actually

2998
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:09,679
think about mortality as a tool as i use

2999
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:12,559
it as a lens through which

3000
01:50:09,679 --> 01:50:15,118
i can then retrospect

3001
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:18,400
and by placing myself at the point of

3002
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:20,000
future mortality i can then use it as a

3003
01:50:18,399 --> 01:50:22,638
retrospective

3004
01:50:20,000 --> 01:50:25,279
lens to focus and ask the following

3005
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:26,800
question is that anything i feel i would

3006
01:50:25,279 --> 01:50:29,279
regret

3007
01:50:26,800 --> 01:50:31,199
and therefore change in the life that i

3008
01:50:29,279 --> 01:50:34,000
currently have now

3009
01:50:31,198 --> 01:50:36,079
i that's the way i meditate and use

3010
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:38,319
mortality as a question

3011
01:50:36,079 --> 01:50:39,439
is to try and course correct and focus

3012
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:42,079
my life

3013
01:50:39,439 --> 01:50:43,039
i worry not about dying

3014
01:50:42,079 --> 01:50:45,599
yeah

3015
01:50:43,039 --> 01:50:47,519
but i like to think about death as a way

3016
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:48,719
to prioritize my life

3017
01:50:47,520 --> 01:50:51,280
if that makes sense i don't know if that

3018
01:50:48,719 --> 01:50:52,719
makes sense no it makes total sense to

3019
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:56,960
decide

3020
01:50:52,719 --> 01:50:59,198
how do you want to live today so that

3021
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:00,960
in the future you do not regret the way

3022
01:50:59,198 --> 01:51:03,198
you live today right and to place

3023
01:51:00,960 --> 01:51:06,480
yourself in the future at your point of

3024
01:51:03,198 --> 01:51:09,439
mortality is one way to i think as an

3025
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:10,319
exercise to retrospectively look

3026
01:51:09,439 --> 01:51:11,118
back

3027
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:13,039
and

3028
01:51:11,118 --> 01:51:15,359
not lose out on informed choices that

3029
01:51:13,039 --> 01:51:17,920
you could otherwise lose out lose out on

3030
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:22,079
if you weren't thinking about mortality

3031
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:24,319
yeah it cl it clarifies your thinking uh

3032
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:27,039
is there um so i mentioned i sleep on

3033
01:51:24,319 --> 01:51:29,679
the floor take naps and power naps and

3034
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:31,760
it's just kind of madness is there uh

3035
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:34,000
weirdness as to your own sleep schedule

3036
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:36,079
as a scientist that

3037
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:38,639
does incredible work has a lot of things

3038
01:51:36,079 --> 01:51:41,198
going on

3039
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:43,199
has has to lead research has to write

3040
01:51:41,198 --> 01:51:45,839
research has to be a science

3041
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:47,678
communicator also have a social life all

3042
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,480
those kinds of things is there

3043
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:50,800
certain

3044
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:52,000
patterns to your own sleep that you

3045
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:53,679
regret

3046
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,760
or you um

3047
01:51:53,679 --> 01:51:58,560
or you participate in

3048
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:01,199
uh that you you find you enjoy

3049
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:04,159
um like is is there some like personal

3050
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:05,839
stuff uh quirks or things you're proud

3051
01:52:04,158 --> 01:52:07,198
of that you do in terms of your sleep

3052
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:09,199
schedule

3053
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:10,960
the funny thing about

3054
01:52:09,198 --> 01:52:13,919
being a sleep researcher is that it

3055
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:16,158
doesn't make you immune right to the

3056
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:17,760
ravages of a difficult night of sleep

3057
01:52:16,158 --> 01:52:20,479
and i have

3058
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:23,039
battled my own periods of insomnia in my

3059
01:52:20,479 --> 01:52:23,039
life too

3060
01:52:24,479 --> 01:52:28,559
and i think i've been fortunate in ways

3061
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:30,639
because i know how sleep works and i

3062
01:52:28,560 --> 01:52:32,560
know how to combat insomnia i know how

3063
01:52:30,639 --> 01:52:35,920
to get it under control

3064
01:52:32,560 --> 01:52:38,239
because insomnia in many ways

3065
01:52:35,920 --> 01:52:40,399
is a condition where all of a sudden

3066
01:52:38,238 --> 01:52:42,879
your sleep controls you

3067
01:52:40,399 --> 01:52:44,799
rather than you control your sleep well

3068
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,639
yeah that's a beautiful way to put it

3069
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:47,920
yeah

3070
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:49,118
and

3071
01:52:47,920 --> 01:52:51,118
i

3072
01:52:49,118 --> 01:52:53,279
know when i'm starting to

3073
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:54,719
lose control and it's starting to take

3074
01:52:53,279 --> 01:52:56,840
control

3075
01:52:54,719 --> 01:53:00,560
and i understand how to

3076
01:52:56,840 --> 01:53:03,520
regain but i've it doesn't happen now

3077
01:53:00,560 --> 01:53:05,760
overnight it takes a long time

3078
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:06,639
so you've struggled with insomnia in

3079
01:53:05,760 --> 01:53:08,400
your life

3080
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:10,239
i have not not all of my life i would

3081
01:53:08,399 --> 01:53:14,000
say i've probably had three or four

3082
01:53:10,238 --> 01:53:16,000
really severe bouts and all of them

3083
01:53:14,000 --> 01:53:18,399
usually triggered by you know emotional

3084
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:21,198
circumstances by stress

3085
01:53:18,399 --> 01:53:22,960
um stress that's connected to actual

3086
01:53:21,198 --> 01:53:24,319
events in life or stress that's

3087
01:53:22,960 --> 01:53:25,198
unexplainable

3088
01:53:24,319 --> 01:53:27,840
will

3089
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:31,039
externally triggered yeah it's sort of

3090
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:33,039
what we would call reactive stress

3091
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:34,079
um

3092
01:53:33,039 --> 01:53:36,319
and

3093
01:53:34,079 --> 01:53:39,039
so that that's sort of point number one

3094
01:53:36,319 --> 01:53:41,359
about the idiosyncrasies the point

3095
01:53:39,039 --> 01:53:43,679
number two is that when you are having a

3096
01:53:41,359 --> 01:53:46,000
difficult night of sleep

3097
01:53:43,679 --> 01:53:47,920
as a sleep researcher you basically have

3098
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:49,760
become the woody allen neurotic of the

3099
01:53:47,920 --> 01:53:51,520
sleep world

3100
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:54,159
because at that moment you know i'm

3101
01:53:51,520 --> 01:53:55,360
trying to fall asleep and i'm not and

3102
01:53:54,158 --> 01:53:57,198
i'm starting to think okay my

3103
01:53:55,359 --> 01:53:58,880
dorsilateral prefrontal cortex is not

3104
01:53:57,198 --> 01:54:00,799
shutting down my noradrenaline is not

3105
01:53:58,880 --> 01:54:02,800
ramping down my sympathetic nervous

3106
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:05,199
system is not giving way to my parasite

3107
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:07,279
at that point you are dead in the water

3108
01:54:05,198 --> 01:54:09,759
for the next two hours and nothing is

3109
01:54:07,279 --> 01:54:12,800
bringing you back so uh there is some

3110
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:14,400
irony in that too i would say for myself

3111
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:17,360
though i

3112
01:54:14,399 --> 01:54:19,679
if there's something i'm not proud of it

3113
01:54:17,359 --> 01:54:23,118
has been

3114
01:54:19,679 --> 01:54:25,520
at times railing against my chronotype

3115
01:54:23,118 --> 01:54:27,359
so your chronotype is essentially are

3116
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:29,280
you a morning type evening type or

3117
01:54:27,359 --> 01:54:30,559
somewhere in between yeah

3118
01:54:29,279 --> 01:54:32,880
and

3119
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:35,679
there were times because society is

3120
01:54:32,880 --> 01:54:36,719
desperately biased towards the morning

3121
01:54:35,679 --> 01:54:38,719
types

3122
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:40,480
you know this notion of the early bird

3123
01:54:38,719 --> 01:54:42,560
catches the worm

3124
01:54:40,479 --> 01:54:46,158
maybe that's true but i'll also tell you

3125
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:50,480
that the second mouse gets the cheese

3126
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:51,598
yeah so i think one of my issues

3127
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:53,198
around

3128
01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:55,199
you know is firstly people don't really

3129
01:54:53,198 --> 01:54:57,039
understand cronotype

3130
01:54:55,198 --> 01:54:58,399
because i'll have some people when i'm

3131
01:54:57,039 --> 01:55:00,079
sort of out in the public they'll say

3132
01:54:58,399 --> 01:55:01,920
look i struggle with terrible insomnia

3133
01:55:00,079 --> 01:55:03,359
and i'll ask them is it problems falling

3134
01:55:01,920 --> 01:55:04,960
asleep or staying asleep and they'll say

3135
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:06,799
falling asleep

3136
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:09,198
and then i'll say look if you are on a

3137
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:12,079
desert island with nothing to wake up

3138
01:55:09,198 --> 01:55:13,439
for no responsibilities what time would

3139
01:55:12,079 --> 01:55:14,719
you normally go to bed and what time

3140
01:55:13,439 --> 01:55:15,919
would you wake up and they would say i'd

3141
01:55:14,719 --> 01:55:17,920
probably like to go to bed about

3142
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:19,920
midnight and wake up maybe eight in the

3143
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:21,679
morning then i'd say so what time do you

3144
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:23,599
now go to bed and they'd say well i've

3145
01:55:21,679 --> 01:55:25,118
got to be up for work early so i get

3146
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:26,800
into bed at 10.

3147
01:55:25,118 --> 01:55:29,039
i say well you don't have insomnia you

3148
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,800
have a mismatch between your biological

3149
01:55:29,039 --> 01:55:33,439
chronotype and your current sleep

3150
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:35,520
schedule and when you align those two

3151
01:55:33,439 --> 01:55:36,799
and i was fighting that for some time

3152
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:39,040
too i'm

3153
01:55:36,800 --> 01:55:41,360
probably

3154
01:55:39,039 --> 01:55:43,118
mostly right in the middle i am

3155
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:45,598
desperately vanilla

3156
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:47,679
unfortunately in many aspects of life

3157
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:49,840
but this included i'm neither a strong

3158
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:51,599
morning type nor a strong evening type

3159
01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:55,039
so ideally i'd probably like to go to

3160
01:55:51,599 --> 01:55:57,760
bed around you know 11 10 30 11 probably

3161
01:55:55,039 --> 01:55:59,599
somewhere between 10 13 11 and wake up

3162
01:55:57,760 --> 01:56:04,000
you know i naturally wake up usually

3163
01:55:59,599 --> 01:56:04,800
most days before my alarm at um 704

3164
01:56:04,000 --> 01:56:07,039
um

3165
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:08,880
and it's 704 because

3166
01:56:07,039 --> 01:56:10,880
why not be idiosyncratic in terms of

3167
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,480
sitting i love it um

3168
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:14,319
and so

3169
01:56:12,479 --> 01:56:16,000
i that's kind of awesome i've never

3170
01:56:14,319 --> 01:56:17,198
heard about that that's that's amazing

3171
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,520
i'm going to start doing that now

3172
01:56:17,198 --> 01:56:20,319
setting alarms like a little bit off the

3173
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:22,080
like

3174
01:56:20,319 --> 01:56:24,719
yeah i know i'm never quite sure why

3175
01:56:22,079 --> 01:56:26,639
we're the celebration of uniqueness

3176
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:28,719
yeah and i am quite the the odd

3177
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:30,880
snowflake in that sense too um

3178
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:33,760
so i would usually then try to force

3179
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:36,000
myself because i had that same mentality

3180
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:38,960
that if i wasn't up at you know

3181
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:41,679
6 13 in the gym by seven

3182
01:56:38,960 --> 01:56:42,960
that there was something wrong with me

3183
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:44,960
and

3184
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:46,800
i quickly abandoned that but if i look

3185
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:48,399
back if there was a shameful act that i

3186
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:50,400
have around my sleep i think it would be

3187
01:56:48,399 --> 01:56:53,359
that for some years until i really

3188
01:56:50,399 --> 01:56:56,079
started to get more detailed into sleep

3189
01:56:53,359 --> 01:56:58,399
and now i have no shame in telling

3190
01:56:56,079 --> 01:57:00,880
people that you know i

3191
01:56:58,399 --> 01:57:04,158
will probably usually wake up around 6

3192
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:05,599
45 naturally sometimes seven

3193
01:57:04,158 --> 01:57:08,719
um when people are looking at me

3194
01:57:05,599 --> 01:57:11,920
thinking you're a sloth you're lazy um

3195
01:57:08,719 --> 01:57:15,198
and you know i don't finish my daily

3196
01:57:11,920 --> 01:57:17,039
workout until you know i'm not working

3197
01:57:15,198 --> 01:57:19,359
until probably nine o'clock in the

3198
01:57:17,039 --> 01:57:22,399
morning i'm thinking what are you doing

3199
01:57:19,359 --> 01:57:24,479
now i will work late into the

3200
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:28,000
day you know if i could i would work 16

3201
01:57:24,479 --> 01:57:29,359
hours that's my passion just like yours

3202
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,000
um

3203
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:34,880
so i don't feel shame around that but i

3204
01:57:32,000 --> 01:57:39,599
have changed my mentality around that

3205
01:57:34,880 --> 01:57:40,400
um it's complicated because i um

3206
01:57:39,599 --> 01:57:43,760
i'm

3207
01:57:40,399 --> 01:57:45,920
probably happiest going to bed at if i'm

3208
01:57:43,760 --> 01:57:48,159
being honest like at 5 00 a.m that's

3209
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:48,960
fine you're just an extreme evening time

3210
01:57:48,158 --> 01:57:52,000
but

3211
01:57:48,960 --> 01:57:54,480
the problem is

3212
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,760
it's not that i'm ashamed for it it's uh

3213
01:57:54,479 --> 01:57:57,678
i actually kind of enjoy it because i

3214
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:59,520
get to sleep through all the nonsense of

3215
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:01,520
like the morning and

3216
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:03,920
isn't that a beautiful thing like people

3217
01:58:01,520 --> 01:58:06,719
are busy with their emails and and i

3218
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:09,440
just am a happy as a cow yeah and i wake

3219
01:58:06,719 --> 01:58:11,359
up after all the drama has been resolved

3220
01:58:09,439 --> 01:58:13,839
yeah and cows are happy and the drama

3221
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:16,158
has been resolved exactly so i but you

3222
01:58:13,840 --> 01:58:18,880
know in society you do especially i mean

3223
01:58:16,158 --> 01:58:20,879
this is what i think about is um

3224
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,118
you know when you work on a larger team

3225
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:24,480
especially with companies

3226
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:26,319
you are

3227
01:58:24,479 --> 01:58:27,439
you know everybody's awake at the same

3228
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:28,880
time so

3229
01:58:27,439 --> 01:58:30,960
that that's definitely that's definitely

3230
01:58:28,880 --> 01:58:33,520
been a struggle to try to figure out

3231
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:35,920
just like you said um how to balance

3232
01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:38,480
that how to fit into society and yet be

3233
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:39,359
optimal for your chronotype

3234
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:41,039
yup

3235
01:58:39,359 --> 01:58:42,319
you have to sleep in synchrony with it

3236
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:44,800
and harmony

3237
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:47,519
um because normally what we know

3238
01:58:44,800 --> 01:58:49,360
is that if you fight biology

3239
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:51,599
you'll normally lose and the way you

3240
01:58:49,359 --> 01:58:52,880
know you've lost is through disease and

3241
01:58:51,599 --> 01:58:54,639
sickness

3242
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:57,359
you said you suffered through several

3243
01:58:54,639 --> 01:58:59,199
bouts of insomnia

3244
01:58:57,359 --> 01:59:02,559
is there

3245
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:04,719
aside from embracing your chronotype

3246
01:59:02,560 --> 01:59:06,320
is there um advice you can give how to

3247
01:59:04,719 --> 01:59:07,599
overcome insomnia from your own

3248
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:09,439
experience

3249
01:59:07,599 --> 01:59:11,199
right now the best method that we have

3250
01:59:09,439 --> 01:59:14,879
is something called cognitive behavioral

3251
01:59:11,198 --> 01:59:18,000
therapy for insomnia or cbti for short

3252
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:19,039
and you work with for people who don't

3253
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,359
know what it is you work with a

3254
01:59:19,039 --> 01:59:23,198
therapist for maybe six weeks and you

3255
01:59:21,359 --> 01:59:24,880
can do it online by the way i

3256
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:26,638
recommend probably jumping online it's

3257
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:28,840
just easiest

3258
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:31,920
and it will change your

3259
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:33,679
beliefs your habits your behaviors and

3260
01:59:31,920 --> 01:59:35,840
your general stress around this thing

3261
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:37,840
called sleep and it is just as effective

3262
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:40,000
as sleeping pills in the short term

3263
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:42,000
but what's great is that unlike sleeping

3264
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:44,800
pills when you stop working with your

3265
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:46,560
therapist those benefits last for years

3266
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:48,000
later whereas when you stop your

3267
01:59:46,560 --> 01:59:49,840
sleeping pills you typically have what's

3268
01:59:48,000 --> 01:59:51,520
called rebound insomnia where your sleep

3269
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:55,360
not only goes back to being as bad as it

3270
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:58,400
was before it's usually even worse

3271
01:59:55,359 --> 02:00:00,559
for me i think i found a number of

3272
01:59:58,399 --> 02:00:02,000
things effective

3273
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:03,679
the first is that i had to really

3274
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,800
address what was

3275
02:00:03,679 --> 02:00:09,520
stressful and try to come up with

3276
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:11,440
some degree of meaningful

3277
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:13,119
rationality around it

3278
02:00:11,439 --> 02:00:14,799
because i think one of the things that

3279
02:00:13,118 --> 02:00:16,719
happens there's something very talking

3280
02:00:14,800 --> 02:00:19,679
about conscious states to come all the

3281
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:21,039
way back to um gosh i don't know i feel

3282
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:22,319
like we've only been chatting for like

3283
02:00:21,039 --> 02:00:24,560
20 minutes but you're going to tell me

3284
02:00:22,319 --> 02:00:27,198
it's been a while it's been a while okay

3285
02:00:24,560 --> 02:00:28,719
and desperately i'm i feel like terribly

3286
02:00:27,198 --> 02:00:30,238
sorry okay but let's come back to

3287
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:33,118
consciousness

3288
02:00:30,238 --> 02:00:36,399
where we started yeah um there is

3289
02:00:33,118 --> 02:00:40,000
something very strange about the night

3290
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:42,238
that thoughts and anxieties

3291
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:44,800
are not the same as they are in the

3292
02:00:42,238 --> 02:00:48,638
waking day they are worse they are

3293
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:50,960
bigger and i at least find that i am

3294
02:00:48,639 --> 02:00:50,960
far

3295
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:56,719
more

3296
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:58,719
likely to catastrophize and ruminate

3297
02:00:56,719 --> 02:01:00,399
at night about things that when i wake

3298
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:02,158
up the next day in the broad light of

3299
02:01:00,399 --> 02:01:04,158
day i think

3300
02:01:02,158 --> 02:01:06,719
it's nowhere near that bad man what were

3301
02:01:04,158 --> 02:01:09,359
you doing it's not that bad at all

3302
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:12,480
so to gain firstly some rational

3303
02:01:09,359 --> 02:01:14,559
understanding of my emotional state

3304
02:01:12,479 --> 02:01:15,519
that's causing that insomnia was very

3305
02:01:14,560 --> 02:01:18,800
helpful

3306
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:20,239
the second thing was to keep regularity

3307
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:23,119
just going to bed at the same time

3308
02:01:20,238 --> 02:01:25,279
waking up and here's an unconventional

3309
02:01:23,118 --> 02:01:28,799
piece of sleep advice

3310
02:01:25,279 --> 02:01:29,599
after a bad night of sleep

3311
02:01:28,800 --> 02:01:31,760
do

3312
02:01:29,599 --> 02:01:34,400
nothing

3313
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:37,199
don't wake up any later

3314
02:01:34,399 --> 02:01:39,439
don't go to bed any earlier

3315
02:01:37,198 --> 02:01:41,118
don't nap during the day

3316
02:01:39,439 --> 02:01:42,399
and don't drink any more coffee than you

3317
02:01:41,118 --> 02:01:44,799
would otherwise

3318
02:01:42,399 --> 02:01:47,039
because if you end up sleeping later

3319
02:01:44,800 --> 02:01:49,440
into the the morning

3320
02:01:47,039 --> 02:01:51,359
you're then not going to be tired at

3321
02:01:49,439 --> 02:01:53,279
your normal time at night so then you're

3322
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:54,880
going to get into bed thinking well i

3323
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:57,359
had a terrible night of sleep last night

3324
02:01:54,880 --> 02:01:59,279
and yes i slept in this morning to try

3325
02:01:57,359 --> 02:02:01,198
and compensate but i'm still going to

3326
02:01:59,279 --> 02:02:03,439
get to bed at my normal time but now you

3327
02:02:01,198 --> 02:02:05,359
get into bed and you haven't been awake

3328
02:02:03,439 --> 02:02:07,039
for as long as you normally would so

3329
02:02:05,359 --> 02:02:10,079
you're not asleepy as you normally would

3330
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:11,920
be and so now you sit there lying in bed

3331
02:02:10,079 --> 02:02:13,760
and it's another bad night

3332
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:15,840
and the same thing is you know if you go

3333
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:18,400
to bed any earlier

3334
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:20,560
so don't wake up any later

3335
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:22,399
wake up at the same time don't go to bed

3336
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:24,400
any earlier because then you're just

3337
02:02:22,399 --> 02:02:26,479
probably your chronotype your biological

3338
02:02:24,399 --> 02:02:28,960
rhythm doesn't want you to be asleep and

3339
02:02:26,479 --> 02:02:31,118
you think well a terrible night i'm

3340
02:02:28,960 --> 02:02:32,800
going to get into bed at 9 00 pm rather

3341
02:02:31,118 --> 02:02:35,198
than my standard 10 you're just going to

3342
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:37,199
be lying in bed awake for that hour

3343
02:02:35,198 --> 02:02:38,799
naps will take our double-edged sword

3344
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:40,638
they can have wonderful benefits we've

3345
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:42,079
done lots of studies on naps for both

3346
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:43,679
the brain and the body

3347
02:02:42,079 --> 02:02:45,519
but they are a double-edged sword in the

3348
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:47,599
sense that

3349
02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:49,360
napping

3350
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:50,800
will just take the edge off your

3351
02:02:49,359 --> 02:02:52,639
sleepiness it's a little bit like a

3352
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:54,079
valve on a pressure cooker when you nap

3353
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:56,159
during the day

3354
02:02:54,079 --> 02:02:57,840
you can take some of that healthy

3355
02:02:56,158 --> 02:03:00,079
sleepiness that you've been building up

3356
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:01,840
during the day and for some people not

3357
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:03,359
all people but for some people that can

3358
02:03:01,840 --> 02:03:05,199
then make it harder for them to fall

3359
02:03:03,359 --> 02:03:07,198
asleep at night and then stay asleep

3360
02:03:05,198 --> 02:03:08,638
soundly across the night

3361
02:03:07,198 --> 02:03:10,719
so the advice would be if you're

3362
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:11,920
struggling with sleep at night don't nap

3363
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:14,399
during the day

3364
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:16,719
but if you are not struggling with sleep

3365
02:03:14,399 --> 02:03:17,598
and you can nap regularly naps are just

3366
02:03:16,719 --> 02:03:19,520
fine

3367
02:03:17,599 --> 02:03:21,440
and we can play around with optimal

3368
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:23,280
durations depending on what you want

3369
02:03:21,439 --> 02:03:25,279
just try not to nap too late into the

3370
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:27,279
day because napping late into the day is

3371
02:03:25,279 --> 02:03:28,960
like snacking before your main meal yeah

3372
02:03:27,279 --> 02:03:32,238
it just takes the edge off your sleep

3373
02:03:28,960 --> 02:03:34,239
hunger as it were but that would be um

3374
02:03:32,238 --> 02:03:35,678
so that's my unconventional

3375
02:03:34,238 --> 02:03:37,039
second piece of advice regarding

3376
02:03:35,679 --> 02:03:39,199
insomnia

3377
02:03:37,039 --> 02:03:41,519
the third is meditation i found

3378
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:44,079
meditation to be incredibly powerful i

3379
02:03:41,520 --> 02:03:47,040
started reading about meditation as i

3380
02:03:44,079 --> 02:03:49,118
was researching that aspect of the book

3381
02:03:47,039 --> 02:03:51,359
um many years ago

3382
02:03:49,118 --> 02:03:54,158
and as a hard-nosed scientist i thought

3383
02:03:51,359 --> 02:03:55,039
this sounds very woo-woo um this is sort

3384
02:03:54,158 --> 02:03:57,359
of

3385
02:03:55,039 --> 02:03:59,279
we all hold hands and sing come by and

3386
02:03:57,359 --> 02:04:02,639
everything's going to be fine with sleep

3387
02:03:59,279 --> 02:04:04,158
i read the data and it was compelling i

3388
02:04:02,639 --> 02:04:07,279
couldn't ignore it

3389
02:04:04,158 --> 02:04:09,519
and i started meditating and that was

3390
02:04:07,279 --> 02:04:12,399
six years ago and i haven't stopped

3391
02:04:09,520 --> 02:04:14,079
and i find meditation before bed

3392
02:04:12,399 --> 02:04:16,319
incredibly powerful

3393
02:04:14,078 --> 02:04:17,679
the meditation app companies were

3394
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:19,359
perplexed at this at first they want

3395
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:20,560
people to meditate during the day but

3396
02:04:19,359 --> 02:04:22,639
when they looked at their usage

3397
02:04:20,560 --> 02:04:24,800
statistics they found that they would

3398
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:26,800
have people in the morning meditating

3399
02:04:24,800 --> 02:04:28,719
and then there's a huge number of people

3400
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:30,800
using the meditation app in the evening

3401
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:33,118
what they were doing was self-medicating

3402
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:35,199
this their insomnia and they finally

3403
02:04:33,118 --> 02:04:38,399
rather than railing against it they

3404
02:04:35,198 --> 02:04:41,198
started to see it as a cash cow

3405
02:04:38,399 --> 02:04:43,439
rightly so yeah so i found meditation to

3406
02:04:41,198 --> 02:04:45,759
be helpful having a wind down routine is

3407
02:04:43,439 --> 02:04:48,078
the other thing that's critical for me

3408
02:04:45,760 --> 02:04:49,760
i can't just go from because when my

3409
02:04:48,078 --> 02:04:51,439
mind is switched on and i think you may

3410
02:04:49,760 --> 02:04:53,360
be like this too

3411
02:04:51,439 --> 02:04:56,000
if i get into bed

3412
02:04:53,359 --> 02:04:59,118
that roller decks of thoughts and

3413
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,960
information and excitement and anxiety

3414
02:04:59,118 --> 02:05:02,559
and worry is just

3415
02:05:00,960 --> 02:05:04,399
whirling away

3416
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:06,800
and it's not going to be a good night

3417
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:09,279
for me so i have to find a wind down

3418
02:05:06,800 --> 02:05:11,039
routine and that makes sense when you

3419
02:05:09,279 --> 02:05:13,920
realize what sleep is like sleep is not

3420
02:05:11,039 --> 02:05:13,920
like a light switch

3421
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:16,880
sleep is much more like trying to land a

3422
02:05:15,679 --> 02:05:19,199
plane

3423
02:05:16,880 --> 02:05:21,520
you know it takes time to descend down

3424
02:05:19,198 --> 02:05:23,198
onto the terra firma that we call sound

3425
02:05:21,520 --> 02:05:25,280
sleep at night

3426
02:05:23,198 --> 02:05:27,919
and we have this for kids you know i

3427
02:05:25,279 --> 02:05:30,719
don't have children but you know

3428
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:33,279
a lot of parents will say

3429
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:35,520
you know we have to have the bedroom

3430
02:05:33,279 --> 02:05:37,679
sorry the bedtime routine you know you

3431
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:39,679
bathe the kids you put them in bed you

3432
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:41,920
read them a story you have to go through

3433
02:05:39,679 --> 02:05:43,199
this routine this wind down routine for

3434
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:44,719
them and then they fall asleep

3435
02:05:43,198 --> 02:05:46,638
wonderfully

3436
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:50,239
why do we abandon that

3437
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:51,359
as adults we need that same wind down

3438
02:05:50,238 --> 02:05:52,158
routine

3439
02:05:51,359 --> 02:05:53,598
so

3440
02:05:52,158 --> 02:05:56,078
that's been the other thing that's been

3441
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:57,840
very helpful to me so um don't do

3442
02:05:56,078 --> 02:06:01,118
anything different if you have a bad

3443
02:05:57,840 --> 02:06:03,039
night of sleep keep doing the same thing

3444
02:06:01,118 --> 02:06:05,439
manage your anxiety understand it

3445
02:06:03,039 --> 02:06:07,439
rationalize it

3446
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:09,519
then meditation

3447
02:06:07,439 --> 02:06:11,839
and then finally having some kind of

3448
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:13,760
disengagement wind down routine

3449
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:16,239
those are the four things that have been

3450
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:18,400
very helpful to me that's brilliant so

3451
02:06:16,238 --> 02:06:21,039
the the regularities really do a lot of

3452
02:06:18,399 --> 02:06:23,198
a lot of work against insomnia is there

3453
02:06:21,039 --> 02:06:23,198
um

3454
02:06:23,679 --> 02:06:28,639
is it possible to have a healthy

3455
02:06:27,198 --> 02:06:30,960
sleep life

3456
02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:32,560
without the regularities

3457
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:34,880
i say that

3458
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:36,480
because i'm all over the place yeah and

3459
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:38,000
i've gotten good in being all over the

3460
02:06:36,479 --> 02:06:41,118
place

3461
02:06:38,000 --> 02:06:42,719
so i'll often like what happens i'll go

3462
02:06:41,118 --> 02:06:46,399
stretches of time there'll be sometimes

3463
02:06:42,719 --> 02:06:48,560
a month where i my days are like this is

3464
02:06:46,399 --> 02:06:50,960
embarrassing to admit but

3465
02:06:48,560 --> 02:06:53,360
they're like just you and i here

3466
02:06:50,960 --> 02:06:55,039
just you and i it's like 28 hours or 30

3467
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:58,479
hour days yeah

3468
02:06:55,039 --> 02:07:00,800
like i'll just go all the way around

3469
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:03,839
comfortably and happily i love it and

3470
02:07:00,800 --> 02:07:05,279
now there'll be a nap i mean if you like

3471
02:07:03,840 --> 02:07:07,840
add up the hours

3472
02:07:05,279 --> 02:07:10,238
when i'm just like sleeping as much

3473
02:07:07,840 --> 02:07:12,639
as i want it'll probably be like six

3474
02:07:10,238 --> 02:07:15,598
hour average per 24 hours

3475
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:18,159
like that kind of yeah so it works out

3476
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:19,199
nicely maybe even seven hours i don't

3477
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:21,439
know but

3478
02:07:19,198 --> 02:07:23,519
that it's obviously irregular and

3479
02:07:21,439 --> 02:07:24,238
there's chaos in the whole thing right

3480
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:25,679
like

3481
02:07:24,238 --> 02:07:27,839
sometimes it's shorter sleeve sometimes

3482
02:07:25,679 --> 02:07:30,078
it's longer is that

3483
02:07:27,840 --> 02:07:31,119
is that totally not a good thing do you

3484
02:07:30,078 --> 02:07:33,279
think

3485
02:07:31,118 --> 02:07:34,960
the best evidence that we have to speak

3486
02:07:33,279 --> 02:07:37,519
to this question is people who are doing

3487
02:07:34,960 --> 02:07:38,840
rotating shifts

3488
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:42,000
and

3489
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:44,639
unfortunately the news is not good um

3490
02:07:42,000 --> 02:07:47,198
they usually have a higher incidence of

3491
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:49,840
many diseases such as

3492
02:07:47,198 --> 02:07:52,078
depression diabetes cardiovascular

3493
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:52,840
disease obesity

3494
02:07:52,078 --> 02:07:54,489
um

3495
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:57,710
stroke and

3496
02:07:54,489 --> 02:07:57,710
[Music]

3497
02:07:59,439 --> 02:08:04,000
and again i'm

3498
02:08:02,078 --> 02:08:06,399
that's just me communicating the data

3499
02:08:04,000 --> 02:08:08,880
that we we have and i'm not telling you

3500
02:08:06,399 --> 02:08:10,158
that you should do anything different

3501
02:08:08,880 --> 02:08:11,760
the other

3502
02:08:10,158 --> 02:08:13,118
thing is that there's nothing in your

3503
02:08:11,760 --> 02:08:15,440
biology

3504
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:17,759
that suggests that that's how your body

3505
02:08:15,439 --> 02:08:21,039
was designed to sleep

3506
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:22,800
um it is a system that

3507
02:08:21,039 --> 02:08:24,800
loves habit you know

3508
02:08:22,800 --> 02:08:27,679
if

3509
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:30,400
if your circadian clock in your brain

3510
02:08:27,679 --> 02:08:32,399
it's called the suprachiasmatic nucleus

3511
02:08:30,399 --> 02:08:34,319
um sits in the middle of your brain

3512
02:08:32,399 --> 02:08:36,399
had a personality trait it would be a

3513
02:08:34,319 --> 02:08:40,000
creature of habit

3514
02:08:36,399 --> 02:08:43,359
it loves habit that's how your biology

3515
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:47,840
is designed to work is through very

3516
02:08:43,359 --> 02:08:48,639
archetypal prototypical expected cycles

3517
02:08:47,840 --> 02:08:51,679
and

3518
02:08:48,639 --> 02:08:53,359
when we when we do something different

3519
02:08:51,679 --> 02:08:55,760
to that then

3520
02:08:53,359 --> 02:08:58,719
you start to see some of the pressure

3521
02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:00,079
stress fractures in the system

3522
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:01,439
but again

3523
02:09:00,078 --> 02:09:04,078
to your point

3524
02:09:01,439 --> 02:09:05,198
if that's something that you don't mind

3525
02:09:04,078 --> 02:09:09,679
you know

3526
02:09:05,198 --> 02:09:09,678
adopting and understanding and um

3527
02:09:09,760 --> 02:09:13,599
then i think you should keep doing what

3528
02:09:11,840 --> 02:09:14,960
you're doing it's complicated you of

3529
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:17,279
course have to be a student of your own

3530
02:09:14,960 --> 02:09:19,760
body and explore it one of the reasons i

3531
02:09:17,279 --> 02:09:23,439
want to have kids

3532
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:26,239
is kids in forces a stricter schedule

3533
02:09:23,439 --> 02:09:28,960
i i think i definitely i've had

3534
02:09:26,238 --> 02:09:30,799
i i definitely feel that i'm um

3535
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:33,118
not living the

3536
02:09:30,800 --> 02:09:35,039
sort of data wise scientifically

3537
02:09:33,118 --> 02:09:36,719
speaking the optimal life

3538
02:09:35,039 --> 02:09:38,880
and me just living the way i want to

3539
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:41,118
live day to day is perhaps not the

3540
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:43,520
optimal way and there's certain things

3541
02:09:41,118 --> 02:09:44,399
that i've seen very successful people

3542
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:46,960
that i

3543
02:09:44,399 --> 02:09:48,399
know in my life when they get when they

3544
02:09:46,960 --> 02:09:50,319
have kids

3545
02:09:48,399 --> 02:09:51,920
they actually their productivity goes up

3546
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:54,319
they get their [ __ ] together there's a

3547
02:09:51,920 --> 02:09:56,319
lot of aspects that everything yeah yeah

3548
02:09:54,319 --> 02:09:58,399
the regularity i mean that creature is a

3549
02:09:56,319 --> 02:10:00,719
habit that's the thing that that that's

3550
02:09:58,399 --> 02:10:02,799
power and then you start to optimally

3551
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:04,800
use the hours you have in the day let me

3552
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:06,880
ask you about actually i just have one

3553
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:09,760
quick point on that too you know we

3554
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:09,760
often think about

3555
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:16,238
sleep as a cost

3556
02:10:14,238 --> 02:10:18,319
but instead i think of sleep as an

3557
02:10:16,238 --> 02:10:19,678
investment

3558
02:10:18,319 --> 02:10:21,920
and the reason is because your

3559
02:10:19,679 --> 02:10:24,000
effectiveness and your efficiency when

3560
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:26,960
you're well slept

3561
02:10:24,000 --> 02:10:29,198
typically exceeds that when you're not

3562
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:32,399
and to me it's the idea of if i'm going

3563
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:34,559
to boil a pot of water

3564
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:36,638
why would i boil it

3565
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:39,360
on medium when i could boil it in half

3566
02:10:36,639 --> 02:10:43,118
the time on high

3567
02:10:39,359 --> 02:10:45,598
yeah and i sometimes worry that when i

3568
02:10:43,118 --> 02:10:48,000
speak to fortune 500 companies and you

3569
02:10:45,599 --> 02:10:50,480
know they're of this mentality of

3570
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:52,719
you know longer hours getting people to

3571
02:10:50,479 --> 02:10:54,559
rise and grind

3572
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:57,198
the first point is that after about 20

3573
02:10:54,560 --> 02:10:59,199
hours of being awake a human being is as

3574
02:10:57,198 --> 02:11:01,598
cognitively as impaired as they would be

3575
02:10:59,198 --> 02:11:02,399
if they were legally drunk

3576
02:11:01,599 --> 02:11:04,000
and

3577
02:11:02,399 --> 02:11:06,479
the reason i bring that point up is

3578
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:09,520
because i don't know any

3579
02:11:06,479 --> 02:11:11,279
company or ceo who would say

3580
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:13,199
i've got this great team they're drunk

3581
02:11:11,279 --> 02:11:14,479
all the time

3582
02:11:13,198 --> 02:11:17,198
but we often

3583
02:11:14,479 --> 02:11:19,279
lord the airport warrior who's flown

3584
02:11:17,198 --> 02:11:21,919
through three different time zones in

3585
02:11:19,279 --> 02:11:25,759
the past two days is on email at 2am and

3586
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:28,319
then is you know in the office at six

3587
02:11:25,760 --> 02:11:29,920
and i think there is some aspect not in

3588
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:32,960
all people but there is sort of some

3589
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:35,840
aspect of that slight sleep machismo

3590
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:38,480
and and that's not what you are very

3591
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:41,840
different you know you are driven by

3592
02:11:38,479 --> 02:11:45,439
a purity of passion and a very authentic

3593
02:11:41,840 --> 02:11:48,000
incredibly genuine goal of wanting to do

3594
02:11:45,439 --> 02:11:50,559
something remarkable with your life

3595
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:52,639
that's not the issue i think i'm i'm

3596
02:11:50,560 --> 02:11:57,119
speaking about

3597
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:57,118
it's just simply that i think the

3598
02:11:59,599 --> 02:12:04,639
this notion of wanting to be awake for

3599
02:12:02,399 --> 02:12:06,960
longer to try and get more done

3600
02:12:04,639 --> 02:12:08,078
right can sometimes be at odds with the

3601
02:12:06,960 --> 02:12:11,118
fact that

3602
02:12:08,078 --> 02:12:13,118
you can actually get so much more done

3603
02:12:11,118 --> 02:12:14,319
if you're well slept and it's this

3604
02:12:13,118 --> 02:12:16,960
trade-off

3605
02:12:14,319 --> 02:12:18,799
i actually admire people that take the

3606
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,480
big risk and work hard whether that

3607
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:21,840
means staying up late at night all those

3608
02:12:20,479 --> 02:12:24,238
kinds of things

3609
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:26,078
but it cannot be in the in the framework

3610
02:12:24,238 --> 02:12:28,158
in the context like what edison said

3611
02:12:26,078 --> 02:12:29,840
which is sleep feels like a waste of

3612
02:12:28,158 --> 02:12:32,559
time

3613
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:34,719
so like if you're not sleeping

3614
02:12:32,560 --> 02:12:36,400
because you think sleep is stupid that's

3615
02:12:34,719 --> 02:12:38,078
totally wrong

3616
02:12:36,399 --> 02:12:39,759
but if you're not sleeping because

3617
02:12:38,078 --> 02:12:42,399
you're deeply passionate about something

3618
02:12:39,760 --> 02:12:44,560
that to me it's a it's a gray area

3619
02:12:42,399 --> 02:12:46,238
of course but that to me is much more

3620
02:12:44,560 --> 02:12:48,560
admirable and it's everything you're

3621
02:12:46,238 --> 02:12:50,399
espousing is saying like whatever the

3622
02:12:48,560 --> 02:12:51,679
hell you're doing you better be aware

3623
02:12:50,399 --> 02:12:53,598
that sleep

3624
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:54,639
long term and short term is really good

3625
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:56,319
for you

3626
02:12:54,639 --> 02:12:57,920
so if you're not sleeping you're

3627
02:12:56,319 --> 02:13:00,000
sacrificing just make sure you're

3628
02:12:57,920 --> 02:13:03,118
sacrificing for the right thing

3629
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,000
i i see vodka and getting drunk the same

3630
02:13:03,118 --> 02:13:06,000
way

3631
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,599
i know it's not good for me i know i'm

3632
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:09,599
not gonna feel good

3633
02:13:07,599 --> 02:13:12,159
days after i know it's gonna decrease my

3634
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:14,560
performance and there's nothing positive

3635
02:13:12,158 --> 02:13:17,439
about it except

3636
02:13:14,560 --> 02:13:18,480
it introduces chaos in my life

3637
02:13:17,439 --> 02:13:20,479
that

3638
02:13:18,479 --> 02:13:23,118
introduces beautiful experiences that i

3639
02:13:20,479 --> 02:13:25,439
would not otherwise have it uh

3640
02:13:23,118 --> 02:13:27,759
creates like this uh

3641
02:13:25,439 --> 02:13:28,799
turmoil of social interaction that

3642
02:13:27,760 --> 02:13:30,719
ultimately

3643
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:32,639
makes me happy that i've experienced

3644
02:13:30,719 --> 02:13:34,560
them in the moment and later at the

3645
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:38,000
stories you get to meet new people it's

3646
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:40,400
like alcohol in this society is is a

3647
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:43,118
an incredible facilitator of that so

3648
02:13:40,399 --> 02:13:46,238
like that's a good example of like not

3649
02:13:43,118 --> 02:13:48,000
sleeping and drinking way too much vodka

3650
02:13:46,238 --> 02:13:50,479
again it's this notion of you know life

3651
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:53,679
is to be lived to

3652
02:13:50,479 --> 02:13:55,598
a degree but you know if you do have

3653
02:13:53,679 --> 02:13:56,800
children um

3654
02:13:55,599 --> 02:13:59,039
i think one of the other things that

3655
02:13:56,800 --> 02:14:01,760
then maybe comes into the picture is the

3656
02:13:59,039 --> 02:14:01,760
fact that now

3657
02:14:02,158 --> 02:14:05,598
there are other people that you have to

3658
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:07,520
live for

3659
02:14:05,599 --> 02:14:10,078
than yourself

3660
02:14:07,520 --> 02:14:12,400
yeah but come on like once they're old

3661
02:14:10,078 --> 02:14:14,158
enough like if you can't if you can't

3662
02:14:12,399 --> 02:14:16,158
defend for yourself you're you're too

3663
02:14:14,158 --> 02:14:19,439
weak get stronger it's going to be that

3664
02:14:16,158 --> 02:14:21,759
kind of fatherhood yeah i got it

3665
02:14:19,439 --> 02:14:23,678
i i'm understanding so much more about

3666
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:25,599
lex friedman than uh

3667
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:28,239
that's why you have to have

3668
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:29,920
your uh for for me that'd be my wife

3669
02:14:28,238 --> 02:14:32,959
would be probably softer it's good cop

3670
02:14:29,920 --> 02:14:32,960
bad cop because i think

3671
02:14:33,359 --> 02:14:37,679
but of course actually because i don't

3672
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:38,960
have kids i've seen some tough dudes

3673
02:14:37,679 --> 02:14:42,319
when they have

3674
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:45,359
kids become this the the like the

3675
02:14:42,319 --> 02:14:47,039
softest the softies they become like

3676
02:14:45,359 --> 02:14:49,839
they they do everything for their kids

3677
02:14:47,039 --> 02:14:51,679
it becomes like it totally transforms

3678
02:14:49,840 --> 02:14:53,039
their life i mean joe rogan is an

3679
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:54,960
example of that

3680
02:14:53,039 --> 02:14:57,279
i just seen so many tough guys

3681
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:59,920
completely become changed

3682
02:14:57,279 --> 02:15:01,679
by having kids which is fascinating to

3683
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:03,840
watch because it just shows you how

3684
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:06,560
meaningful having kids is for a lot of

3685
02:15:03,840 --> 02:15:08,480
people although i would say having

3686
02:15:06,560 --> 02:15:11,360
you know um

3687
02:15:08,479 --> 02:15:13,598
chatted with joe for for some time um i

3688
02:15:11,359 --> 02:15:16,319
think he is a delightful sweetheart

3689
02:15:13,599 --> 02:15:17,840
independent of children i think

3690
02:15:16,319 --> 02:15:19,599
don't get me wrong i don't want to be in

3691
02:15:17,840 --> 02:15:22,159
a ring with him

3692
02:15:19,599 --> 02:15:24,319
he would face me five ways till tuesday

3693
02:15:22,158 --> 02:15:26,638
but um i think he's a desperately sweet

3694
02:15:24,319 --> 02:15:28,719
man and a very very smart individual

3695
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:30,880
yeah i mean but he talks about the

3696
02:15:28,719 --> 02:15:33,359
compassion he's gained from realizing

3697
02:15:30,880 --> 02:15:35,920
just watching kids grow up that we were

3698
02:15:33,359 --> 02:15:38,479
all kids at some point you you get a new

3699
02:15:35,920 --> 02:15:40,960
new perspective i think just like me i

3700
02:15:38,479 --> 02:15:43,039
still get this uh with him he's super

3701
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:45,279
competitive and like there's a certain

3702
02:15:43,039 --> 02:15:47,599
way to approach life

3703
02:15:45,279 --> 02:15:49,679
like you're striving to do great things

3704
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:52,560
and you're competitive against others

3705
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:54,319
and that intensity or that aggression

3706
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:56,480
um that

3707
02:15:54,319 --> 02:15:58,238
can lack compassion sometimes in empathy

3708
02:15:56,479 --> 02:16:00,319
and when you have children you get

3709
02:15:58,238 --> 02:16:02,399
a sense like oh everybody was a child at

3710
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:04,639
some point everybody was as a kid and

3711
02:16:02,399 --> 02:16:06,559
you see that whole development process

3712
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:08,800
it can definitely enrich

3713
02:16:06,560 --> 02:16:10,239
um expand

3714
02:16:08,800 --> 02:16:13,199
your your

3715
02:16:10,238 --> 02:16:16,158
ability to be empathetic

3716
02:16:13,198 --> 02:16:18,319
let me ask you about diet

3717
02:16:16,158 --> 02:16:19,439
so what's the connection between diet

3718
02:16:18,319 --> 02:16:21,759
and sleep

3719
02:16:19,439 --> 02:16:23,678
so i do intermittent fasting sometimes

3720
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:24,639
only one meal a day sometimes no meals a

3721
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:26,078
day

3722
02:16:24,639 --> 02:16:27,679
is there a good science on the

3723
02:16:26,078 --> 02:16:29,759
interaction between

3724
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:32,960
fasting and sleep

3725
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:35,200
we have some data i would prefer more

3726
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:38,478
but we have data both on

3727
02:16:35,200 --> 02:16:40,159
time restricted eating

3728
02:16:38,478 --> 02:16:43,119
and then

3729
02:16:40,159 --> 02:16:45,840
we have some data on

3730
02:16:43,120 --> 02:16:49,120
fasting to a

3731
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:51,200
on time restricted eating

3732
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:52,960
i think that it has some benefits

3733
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:55,200
although the human replication studies

3734
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:57,919
have actually not borne out quite the

3735
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:59,439
same health benefit extent that the

3736
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:01,280
animal studies have been some

3737
02:16:59,439 --> 02:17:03,679
disappointing

3738
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:06,800
studies one here close to where we are

3739
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:09,120
right now at ucsf recently

3740
02:17:06,799 --> 02:17:11,438
so i think time restricted eating can be

3741
02:17:09,120 --> 02:17:13,679
a good thing and there are many benefits

3742
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:16,000
of time restricted eating is sleep one

3743
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:17,599
of them no it doesn't seem to be

3744
02:17:16,000 --> 02:17:19,679
because there are probably at the time

3745
02:17:17,599 --> 02:17:21,920
that we're recording this three pretty

3746
02:17:19,679 --> 02:17:24,960
decent studies that i'm aware of

3747
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:27,280
um two out of the three were in obese

3748
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:29,759
individuals one out of the three were in

3749
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:31,760
healthy weight individuals and what they

3750
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:34,079
found was that time restricted eating in

3751
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:36,318
all three of those studies didn't have

3752
02:17:34,079 --> 02:17:39,120
any advantageous benefit to sleep it

3753
02:17:36,318 --> 02:17:41,679
didn't necessarily harm sleep but it

3754
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:43,439
didn't seem to improve it

3755
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:45,840
when it comes to fasting though which is

3756
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:47,359
a different state

3757
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:48,880
we don't have too many studies

3758
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:50,800
experimental studies with long-term

3759
02:17:48,879 --> 02:17:53,759
fasting the best data that we have is

3760
02:17:50,799 --> 02:17:56,239
probably from religious practices and

3761
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:59,920
probably the most data we have is during

3762
02:17:56,239 --> 02:18:04,558
ramadan where people will fast for 29 to

3763
02:17:59,920 --> 02:18:07,120
30 days from sunrise to sunset

3764
02:18:04,558 --> 02:18:10,000
and under those conditions

3765
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:12,240
there are probably

3766
02:18:10,000 --> 02:18:13,840
are probably five distinct changes that

3767
02:18:12,239 --> 02:18:15,359
we've seen

3768
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:17,200
none of them seem to be particularly

3769
02:18:15,359 --> 02:18:18,880
good for sleep the first is that the

3770
02:18:17,200 --> 02:18:21,200
amount of melatonin that you release a

3771
02:18:18,879 --> 02:18:23,279
melatonin is a hormone it's often called

3772
02:18:21,200 --> 02:18:25,840
the hormone of darkness

3773
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:27,599
or the vampire hormone not because it

3774
02:18:25,840 --> 02:18:29,599
makes you look longingly at people's

3775
02:18:27,599 --> 02:18:32,159
necklines but it's just because it comes

3776
02:18:29,599 --> 02:18:34,558
out at night yeah melatonin signals to

3777
02:18:32,159 --> 02:18:36,239
your brain that and your body that it's

3778
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:37,358
dark it's nighttime and it's time to

3779
02:18:36,239 --> 02:18:38,718
sleep

3780
02:18:37,359 --> 02:18:41,679
those individuals when they were

3781
02:18:38,718 --> 02:18:42,638
undergoing that regiment of fasting

3782
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:44,079
they

3783
02:18:42,638 --> 02:18:46,000
the amount of melatonin that was

3784
02:18:44,079 --> 02:18:48,159
released and when it was released the

3785
02:18:46,000 --> 02:18:49,040
amount of melatonin decreased

3786
02:18:48,159 --> 02:18:51,200
and

3787
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:53,439
when it was released came later that was

3788
02:18:51,200 --> 02:18:54,240
the first thing the second thing was

3789
02:18:53,439 --> 02:18:56,880
that

3790
02:18:54,239 --> 02:18:59,199
they ended up finding it harder to fall

3791
02:18:56,879 --> 02:19:00,478
asleep as quickly as they normally would

3792
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:01,920
otherwise

3793
02:19:00,478 --> 02:19:03,760
the third thing was that the total

3794
02:19:01,920 --> 02:19:05,120
amount of sleep that they were getting

3795
02:19:03,760 --> 02:19:07,599
decreased

3796
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:11,120
the fourth fascinating thing was that a

3797
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:13,040
wake promoting chemical called erectin

3798
02:19:11,120 --> 02:19:15,679
increased and this is why a lot of

3799
02:19:13,040 --> 02:19:18,319
people will say when i'm fasting it

3800
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:21,519
feels like i can stay awake for longer

3801
02:19:18,318 --> 02:19:22,959
and i can i'm more alert i'm more active

3802
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:24,398
and i'll come back to from an

3803
02:19:22,959 --> 02:19:26,558
evolutionary perspective why we

3804
02:19:24,398 --> 02:19:28,478
understand that to be the case

3805
02:19:26,558 --> 02:19:30,799
and then the fourth factor is that

3806
02:19:28,478 --> 02:19:33,199
fasting didn't decrease the amount of

3807
02:19:30,799 --> 02:19:35,438
deep sleep that seemed to be unaffected

3808
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:37,679
it did however decrease the amount of

3809
02:19:35,439 --> 02:19:40,079
rem sleep or dream sleep and we know

3810
02:19:37,679 --> 02:19:42,478
that rem sleep dreaming is essential for

3811
02:19:40,079 --> 02:19:45,599
emotional first aid mental health it's

3812
02:19:42,478 --> 02:19:47,358
critical for memory creativity it's also

3813
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:50,239
critical for several hormone functions

3814
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:52,079
it's when you know if you there's direct

3815
02:19:50,239 --> 02:19:54,478
correlations between testosterone you

3816
02:19:52,079 --> 02:19:56,159
know testosterone release peaks just

3817
02:19:54,478 --> 02:19:57,920
before you go into rem sleep and during

3818
02:19:56,159 --> 02:20:00,239
rem sleep too

3819
02:19:57,920 --> 02:20:02,239
so rem sleep is critical

3820
02:20:00,239 --> 02:20:04,159
but so those are the five changes that

3821
02:20:02,239 --> 02:20:06,879
we've seen none of them seem to be that

3822
02:20:04,159 --> 02:20:09,359
advantageous for sleep but the fourth

3823
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:12,159
point that i mentioned which was orexin

3824
02:20:09,359 --> 02:20:14,318
which is this wake promoting chemical

3825
02:20:12,159 --> 02:20:16,639
and a good demonstration or a very sad

3826
02:20:14,318 --> 02:20:18,959
demonstration of its power is when it

3827
02:20:16,639 --> 02:20:20,159
becomes very deficient in the brain and

3828
02:20:18,959 --> 02:20:21,759
it leads to a condition called

3829
02:20:20,159 --> 02:20:24,000
narcolepsy

3830
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:26,239
where you know you

3831
02:20:24,000 --> 02:20:28,879
you're just unpredictable with your

3832
02:20:26,239 --> 02:20:30,478
sleep and you um so

3833
02:20:28,879 --> 02:20:32,000
um

3834
02:20:30,478 --> 02:20:34,318
so erection when it's in high

3835
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:37,280
concentrations keeps you awake when you

3836
02:20:34,318 --> 02:20:38,799
lose it it can you know it can put you

3837
02:20:37,280 --> 02:20:40,880
very much into a state of narcolepsy

3838
02:20:38,799 --> 02:20:43,519
where you're sleeping a lot of the time

3839
02:20:40,879 --> 02:20:46,478
in unpredictable sleep

3840
02:20:43,520 --> 02:20:50,079
why on earth when you are fasting

3841
02:20:46,478 --> 02:20:51,519
with the brain release awake promoting

3842
02:20:50,079 --> 02:20:53,840
chemical

3843
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:55,920
and our answer is right now is the

3844
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:58,318
following the one of the few times that

3845
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:59,520
i mentioned before that we see animals

3846
02:20:58,318 --> 02:21:01,760
undergoing

3847
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:03,920
insufficient sleep or

3848
02:21:01,760 --> 02:21:06,398
prolonged sleep deprivation is under

3849
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:07,359
conditions of starvation

3850
02:21:06,398 --> 02:21:09,519
and

3851
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:12,239
that is an extreme

3852
02:21:09,520 --> 02:21:14,239
evolutionary pressure and at that point

3853
02:21:12,239 --> 02:21:17,039
the brain will forego some it won't

3854
02:21:14,239 --> 02:21:18,318
forego all but it will forego some of

3855
02:21:17,040 --> 02:21:20,080
its sleep

3856
02:21:18,318 --> 02:21:22,000
and the reason is so that it can stay

3857
02:21:20,079 --> 02:21:24,559
awake for longer because the sign of

3858
02:21:22,000 --> 02:21:26,959
starvation is saying to the brain you

3859
02:21:24,559 --> 02:21:29,039
can't find food in your normal foraging

3860
02:21:26,959 --> 02:21:30,959
perimeter you need to stay awake for

3861
02:21:29,040 --> 02:21:34,080
longer so you can travel outside of your

3862
02:21:30,959 --> 02:21:36,079
perimeter for a fur further distance and

3863
02:21:34,079 --> 02:21:37,120
maybe you will find food and save the

3864
02:21:36,079 --> 02:21:39,520
organism

3865
02:21:37,120 --> 02:21:42,960
so in other words when we fast

3866
02:21:39,520 --> 02:21:45,040
it's giving our brain this evolutionary

3867
02:21:42,959 --> 02:21:47,679
signal that you are under conditions of

3868
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:49,600
starvation so the brain responds by

3869
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:51,760
saying oh my goodness i need to release

3870
02:21:49,600 --> 02:21:54,159
the chemical that helps the organism

3871
02:21:51,760 --> 02:21:57,280
stay awake for longer which is a raxiom

3872
02:21:54,159 --> 02:21:58,719
so that they can forage for more food

3873
02:21:57,280 --> 02:22:00,319
now of course your brain from an

3874
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:02,959
evolutionary perspective doesn't know

3875
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:04,559
about this thing called safeway

3876
02:22:02,959 --> 02:22:05,759
that you could easily go to and break

3877
02:22:04,559 --> 02:22:08,318
the fast

3878
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:09,680
but that's how we understand fasting and

3879
02:22:08,318 --> 02:22:11,760
i think you know

3880
02:22:09,680 --> 02:22:14,000
my dear friend peter tier has um has

3881
02:22:11,760 --> 02:22:16,239
done a lot of work in this area too i

3882
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:18,559
think fasting and david sinclair is

3883
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:20,318
brilliant work goodness me what an

3884
02:22:18,559 --> 02:22:22,239
individual too

3885
02:22:20,318 --> 02:22:25,039
the work is pretty clear there that you

3886
02:22:22,239 --> 02:22:26,000
know time restricted eating and fasting

3887
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:28,479
have

3888
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:30,478
wonderful health benefits time you know

3889
02:22:28,478 --> 02:22:32,559
fasting is

3890
02:22:30,478 --> 02:22:34,879
creates this thing called hermesis

3891
02:22:32,559 --> 02:22:39,519
just like exercise and

3892
02:22:34,879 --> 02:22:41,519
low level stress and sauna heat shock um

3893
02:22:39,520 --> 02:22:43,840
and hormesis is a biological process i

3894
02:22:41,520 --> 02:22:45,840
think as david sinclair has once said in

3895
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:48,880
simple layman's terms is what what

3896
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:51,920
doesn't kill you makes you stronger

3897
02:22:48,879 --> 02:22:53,358
and i think the

3898
02:22:51,920 --> 02:22:55,280
there is certainly good data that

3899
02:22:53,359 --> 02:22:57,840
fasting and time-restricted eating has

3900
02:22:55,280 --> 02:22:59,280
many benefits is sleep one of them it

3901
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:00,559
doesn't seem to be it doesn't seem to

3902
02:22:59,280 --> 02:23:02,560
enhance sleep

3903
02:23:00,559 --> 02:23:07,039
but it's interesting to to

3904
02:23:02,559 --> 02:23:10,559
understand its effects on sleep i've um

3905
02:23:07,040 --> 02:23:10,560
like i've fasted

3906
02:23:10,799 --> 02:23:16,799
it's a study of nf2 i've once fasted 72

3907
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,920
hours and another time 48 hours

3908
02:23:16,799 --> 02:23:20,478
and

3909
02:23:17,920 --> 02:23:22,398
i found that i got much less sleep and

3910
02:23:20,478 --> 02:23:24,239
was very restful though

3911
02:23:22,398 --> 02:23:26,799
i hesitate to say this but this is how i

3912
02:23:24,239 --> 02:23:28,799
felt which is i needed less sleep

3913
02:23:26,799 --> 02:23:30,959
i wonder if my brain is deceiving me

3914
02:23:28,799 --> 02:23:33,679
because it feels like i'm getting

3915
02:23:30,959 --> 02:23:35,358
a whole extra amount of focus

3916
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:36,559
for free

3917
02:23:35,359 --> 02:23:38,880
and

3918
02:23:36,559 --> 02:23:42,719
i wonder if there's long-term impacts of

3919
02:23:38,879 --> 02:23:44,719
that because if i fast 24 hours

3920
02:23:42,719 --> 02:23:45,760
get the same amount of calories one meal

3921
02:23:44,719 --> 02:23:47,519
a day

3922
02:23:45,760 --> 02:23:49,200
there's a little bit of discomfort like

3923
02:23:47,520 --> 02:23:50,479
just uh maybe your body gets a little

3924
02:23:49,200 --> 02:23:53,040
bit colder

3925
02:23:50,478 --> 02:23:54,559
maybe there's just i mean

3926
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:56,319
hunger

3927
02:23:54,559 --> 02:24:00,239
but the amount of

3928
02:23:56,318 --> 02:24:02,239
focus is crazy yeah and so i wonder it's

3929
02:24:00,239 --> 02:24:03,840
like i'm a little suspicious of that i

3930
02:24:02,239 --> 02:24:06,159
feel like i'm getting something for free

3931
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:08,239
it's i'm the same way with sweetener

3932
02:24:06,159 --> 02:24:10,239
like uh splenda or something it's like

3933
02:24:08,239 --> 02:24:12,959
it's got to be really bad for you right

3934
02:24:10,239 --> 02:24:14,398
because why is it so tasty right and i

3935
02:24:12,959 --> 02:24:15,759
think yeah

3936
02:24:14,398 --> 02:24:18,159
as we said

3937
02:24:15,760 --> 02:24:21,120
for with biology

3938
02:24:18,159 --> 02:24:25,119
you know if there's freeze again there's

3939
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:25,920
yeah there's often a cost too so

3940
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:27,840
but

3941
02:24:25,920 --> 02:24:29,359
we at least understand the biological

3942
02:24:27,840 --> 02:24:30,159
basis of what you're describing it's not

3943
02:24:29,359 --> 02:24:32,960
that

3944
02:24:30,159 --> 02:24:36,639
you you actually don't need less sleep

3945
02:24:32,959 --> 02:24:39,679
it's that this chemical is present that

3946
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:42,239
forces you more awake and so

3947
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:43,920
subjectively you feel as though i don't

3948
02:24:42,239 --> 02:24:45,039
need as much sleep because i'm wide

3949
02:24:43,920 --> 02:24:47,680
awake

3950
02:24:45,040 --> 02:24:49,920
and those two things are quite different

3951
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:52,639
it's not as though you your sleep need

3952
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:54,879
has decreased it's that your brain has

3953
02:24:52,639 --> 02:24:57,439
hit the overdrive switch the overboost

3954
02:24:54,879 --> 02:25:00,639
switch to say we need to keep you awake

3955
02:24:57,439 --> 02:25:02,559
because food is in short supply

3956
02:25:00,639 --> 02:25:04,079
so you mentioned uh during sleep there's

3957
02:25:02,559 --> 02:25:06,000
assimilation all those kinds of things

3958
02:25:04,079 --> 02:25:08,079
for learning purposes but there's also

3959
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:11,280
these uh you mentioned the five ways in

3960
02:25:08,079 --> 02:25:12,719
which we become psychotic in dreams

3961
02:25:11,280 --> 02:25:14,640
what do you think

3962
02:25:12,719 --> 02:25:16,239
what do you think dreams are about

3963
02:25:14,639 --> 02:25:18,559
what

3964
02:25:16,239 --> 02:25:20,959
why do you think we dream what

3965
02:25:18,559 --> 02:25:24,318
place do we go to when we dream

3966
02:25:20,959 --> 02:25:26,000
and why are they useful not just um not

3967
02:25:24,318 --> 02:25:28,239
just the assimilation aspect but just

3968
02:25:26,000 --> 02:25:31,120
like all the crazy visuals that we get

3969
02:25:28,239 --> 02:25:33,199
with dreams is there something uh

3970
02:25:31,120 --> 02:25:35,920
you can speak to that's actually useful

3971
02:25:33,200 --> 02:25:38,960
like why we have such fun

3972
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:39,920
experiences in that dream world

3973
02:25:38,959 --> 02:25:41,438
so

3974
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:44,478
one of the

3975
02:25:41,439 --> 02:25:46,318
camps in the sleep field is that dreams

3976
02:25:44,478 --> 02:25:48,639
are meaningless

3977
02:25:46,318 --> 02:25:51,359
that they are an epi phenomenal

3978
02:25:48,639 --> 02:25:53,599
byproduct of this thing called rem sleep

3979
02:25:51,359 --> 02:25:55,359
from which dreams come from as a

3980
02:25:53,600 --> 02:25:56,159
physiological state

3981
02:25:55,359 --> 02:25:58,318
so

3982
02:25:56,159 --> 02:26:00,159
the analogy would be

3983
02:25:58,318 --> 02:26:02,159
let's think of a light bulb

3984
02:26:00,159 --> 02:26:04,639
that the reason that you create the

3985
02:26:02,159 --> 02:26:06,879
apparatus of a light bulb is to produce

3986
02:26:04,639 --> 02:26:09,439
this thing called light in the same way

3987
02:26:06,879 --> 02:26:11,039
that we we've evolved to this thing

3988
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:13,600
called rem sleep to serve whatever

3989
02:26:11,040 --> 02:26:15,520
functions rem sleep

3990
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:17,920
but it turns out that when you create

3991
02:26:15,520 --> 02:26:19,680
light in that way you also produce

3992
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:21,280
something called heat

3993
02:26:19,680 --> 02:26:23,439
it was never the reason that you

3994
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:25,120
designed the light bulb it's just what

3995
02:26:23,439 --> 02:26:26,000
happens when you create light in that

3996
02:26:25,120 --> 02:26:29,040
way

3997
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:30,959
and the belief so too was that dreaming

3998
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:32,160
was essentially the heat of the light

3999
02:26:30,959 --> 02:26:33,358
bulb

4000
02:26:32,159 --> 02:26:35,760
that

4001
02:26:33,359 --> 02:26:38,318
rem sleep is critical but when you have

4002
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:41,120
rem sleep with a complex brain like ours

4003
02:26:38,318 --> 02:26:44,398
you also produce this conscious epi

4004
02:26:41,120 --> 02:26:46,960
phenomenon called dreaming

4005
02:26:44,398 --> 02:26:49,519
i don't believe that for a second

4006
02:26:46,959 --> 02:26:52,159
uh i and from a simple perspective is

4007
02:26:49,520 --> 02:26:55,040
that i suspect that dreaming is more

4008
02:26:52,159 --> 02:26:57,039
metabolically costly as a conscious

4009
02:26:55,040 --> 02:26:59,520
experience than not dreaming so you

4010
02:26:57,040 --> 02:27:01,120
could still have rem sleep but

4011
02:26:59,520 --> 02:27:04,560
absent the conscious experience of

4012
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:07,439
dreaming was probably less metabolically

4013
02:27:04,559 --> 02:27:10,879
costly and whenever mother nature burns

4014
02:27:07,439 --> 02:27:13,600
the energy unit called atp which is the

4015
02:27:10,879 --> 02:27:15,519
most valuable thing

4016
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:19,040
there's usually a reason for it so if

4017
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:20,319
what if it's more energetically

4018
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:22,160
demanding

4019
02:27:20,318 --> 02:27:24,478
then i suspect that there is a function

4020
02:27:22,159 --> 02:27:27,359
to it and we've now since discovered

4021
02:27:24,478 --> 02:27:30,398
that dreams have a function the first as

4022
02:27:27,359 --> 02:27:33,680
we mentioned creativity the second is

4023
02:27:30,398 --> 02:27:35,119
that dreams provide a form of overnight

4024
02:27:33,680 --> 02:27:37,600
therapy

4025
02:27:35,120 --> 02:27:38,720
dreaming is a form of emotional first

4026
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,479
aid

4027
02:27:38,719 --> 02:27:42,639
and it's during dream sleep at night

4028
02:27:40,478 --> 02:27:44,639
that we take these difficult painful

4029
02:27:42,639 --> 02:27:46,879
experiences that we've had during the

4030
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:49,119
day sometimes traumatic

4031
02:27:46,879 --> 02:27:51,199
and dream sleep acts almost like a

4032
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:52,880
nocturnal soothing balm

4033
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:54,960
and it sort of just takes the sharp

4034
02:27:52,879 --> 02:27:56,159
edges off those difficult painful

4035
02:27:54,959 --> 02:27:58,478
experiences

4036
02:27:56,159 --> 02:28:00,159
so that you come back the next day

4037
02:27:58,478 --> 02:28:01,358
and you feel better

4038
02:28:00,159 --> 02:28:03,920
about them

4039
02:28:01,359 --> 02:28:07,439
and so i think in that sense dreaming

4040
02:28:03,920 --> 02:28:10,079
it's not time that heals all wounds it's

4041
02:28:07,439 --> 02:28:12,639
time during dream sleep that provides

4042
02:28:10,079 --> 02:28:15,680
emotional convalescence

4043
02:28:12,639 --> 02:28:19,358
so dreaming is almost a form of you know

4044
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:19,359
emotional windscreen wipers

4045
02:28:19,760 --> 02:28:23,520
and i think

4046
02:28:20,959 --> 02:28:25,599
and by the way it's not just

4047
02:28:23,520 --> 02:28:28,800
that you dream

4048
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:29,920
it's what you dream about that also

4049
02:28:28,799 --> 02:28:31,599
matters

4050
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:33,200
so for example scientists have done

4051
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:33,920
studies with learning and memory where

4052
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:37,200
they

4053
02:28:33,920 --> 02:28:39,439
have people learn a virtual maze

4054
02:28:37,200 --> 02:28:41,760
and what they discovered was that

4055
02:28:39,439 --> 02:28:45,520
those people who then

4056
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:48,159
dreamed but dreamed of the maze were the

4057
02:28:45,520 --> 02:28:50,640
only ones who when they woke up ended up

4058
02:28:48,159 --> 02:28:53,520
being better at navigating the maze

4059
02:28:50,639 --> 02:28:56,000
whereas those people who dreamed but

4060
02:28:53,520 --> 02:28:58,000
didn't dream about the maze itself they

4061
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,000
were no better at navigating the maze so

4062
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:02,318
it's not just that you it's not it's

4063
02:29:00,000 --> 02:29:04,719
sort of necessary but not sufficient

4064
02:29:02,318 --> 02:29:06,719
it's necessary that you dream but it's

4065
02:29:04,719 --> 02:29:08,559
not sufficient to produce the benefit

4066
02:29:06,719 --> 02:29:11,599
you have to be dreaming about certain

4067
02:29:08,559 --> 02:29:13,199
things itself and the same is true for

4068
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:14,800
mental health

4069
02:29:13,200 --> 02:29:16,159
what we've discovered is that people who

4070
02:29:14,799 --> 02:29:18,639
are going through a very difficult

4071
02:29:16,159 --> 02:29:21,119
experience a trauma for example a very

4072
02:29:18,639 --> 02:29:23,119
painful divorce

4073
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:26,319
those people who are dreaming but

4074
02:29:23,120 --> 02:29:28,800
dreaming of that difficult event itself

4075
02:29:26,318 --> 02:29:31,039
they go on to gain resolution to their

4076
02:29:28,799 --> 02:29:33,519
clinical depression one year later

4077
02:29:31,040 --> 02:29:36,160
whereas people who were dreaming

4078
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:39,439
just as much but not dreaming about the

4079
02:29:36,159 --> 02:29:40,879
trauma itself did not go on to gain as

4080
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:42,239
much clinical resolution to their

4081
02:29:40,879 --> 02:29:43,199
depression

4082
02:29:42,239 --> 02:29:44,159
so

4083
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:46,399
it

4084
02:29:44,159 --> 02:29:48,559
i think to me those are the lines of

4085
02:29:46,398 --> 02:29:51,760
evidence that tell me dreaming is not

4086
02:29:48,559 --> 02:29:54,719
epi phenomenal and it's not just about

4087
02:29:51,760 --> 02:29:55,840
the act of dreaming it's about the

4088
02:29:54,719 --> 02:29:58,239
content

4089
02:29:55,840 --> 02:30:00,960
of the dreams not just

4090
02:29:58,239 --> 02:30:02,398
the fact of a dream itself it's first of

4091
02:30:00,959 --> 02:30:04,639
all it's fascinating it makes a lot of

4092
02:30:02,398 --> 02:30:05,519
sense but then immediately takes my mind

4093
02:30:04,639 --> 02:30:07,439
to

4094
02:30:05,520 --> 02:30:09,600
from an engineering perspective how that

4095
02:30:07,439 --> 02:30:11,120
could be useful in for example ai

4096
02:30:09,600 --> 02:30:13,120
systems

4097
02:30:11,120 --> 02:30:16,000
of uh

4098
02:30:13,120 --> 02:30:18,160
if you think about dreaming as a

4099
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:21,200
important part about learning and

4100
02:30:18,159 --> 02:30:21,200
cognition and

4101
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:25,280
filtering previous memories of what's

4102
02:30:23,040 --> 02:30:27,200
important integrating them

4103
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:29,760
you know maybe you can correct me but i

4104
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:31,359
see dreaming is a kind of simulation of

4105
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:34,398
worlds

4106
02:30:31,359 --> 02:30:36,880
that are not constrained by physics

4107
02:30:34,398 --> 02:30:38,159
so like you you get a chance to take

4108
02:30:36,879 --> 02:30:40,159
some of your memories some of your

4109
02:30:38,159 --> 02:30:42,000
thoughts on your anxieties

4110
02:30:40,159 --> 02:30:44,318
and play with them

4111
02:30:42,000 --> 02:30:46,398
like construct virtual worlds and see

4112
02:30:44,318 --> 02:30:49,039
how it evolves

4113
02:30:46,398 --> 02:30:51,039
like to to play with those worlds in a

4114
02:30:49,040 --> 02:30:52,720
safe environment of your mind

4115
02:30:51,040 --> 02:30:54,640
safe in quotes because you can probably

4116
02:30:52,719 --> 02:30:58,000
get into a lot of trouble with

4117
02:30:54,639 --> 02:30:58,840
what the places your mind will go but

4118
02:30:58,000 --> 02:31:02,719
in

4119
02:30:58,840 --> 02:31:05,120
um this this this definitely is applied

4120
02:31:02,719 --> 02:31:06,639
in much cruder ways in artificial

4121
02:31:05,120 --> 02:31:09,040
intelligence so

4122
02:31:06,639 --> 02:31:09,760
one context in which this is applied is

4123
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:12,640
uh

4124
02:31:09,760 --> 02:31:15,200
the process called uh self-play

4125
02:31:12,639 --> 02:31:17,519
which is uh reinforcement learning

4126
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:20,000
where uh agents play against

4127
02:31:17,520 --> 02:31:22,560
it's itself or versions of itself and

4128
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:24,478
it's all simulated of trying different

4129
02:31:22,559 --> 02:31:26,318
versions of themselves and playing

4130
02:31:24,478 --> 02:31:28,959
against each other to see

4131
02:31:26,318 --> 02:31:31,840
what ends up being a good

4132
02:31:28,959 --> 02:31:33,759
the ultimate goal is to learn um

4133
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:35,359
a function that represents what is good

4134
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:37,120
and what is not good in terms of how you

4135
02:31:35,359 --> 02:31:39,520
should act right you create a set of

4136
02:31:37,120 --> 02:31:41,439
decision weights based on experience and

4137
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:43,680
you constantly update those weights

4138
02:31:41,439 --> 02:31:45,920
based on ongoing learning but the the

4139
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:48,079
experience is artificially created

4140
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:49,439
versus actual

4141
02:31:48,079 --> 02:31:51,280
real data so that's

4142
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:53,040
it's a crude approximation what dreams

4143
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:54,319
are which is you're hallucinating a lot

4144
02:31:53,040 --> 02:31:56,640
of things

4145
02:31:54,318 --> 02:31:58,478
to see which things are actually no i

4146
02:31:56,639 --> 02:32:00,318
think it's and it's been a theory that's

4147
02:31:58,478 --> 02:32:04,879
been put forward which is that dreaming

4148
02:32:00,318 --> 02:32:07,600
is a virtual reality test space that is

4149
02:32:04,879 --> 02:32:10,079
largely consequence-free

4150
02:32:07,600 --> 02:32:13,120
what an incredible gift to give a

4151
02:32:10,079 --> 02:32:15,439
conscious mind each and every night

4152
02:32:13,120 --> 02:32:17,600
now the the conscious mind the human

4153
02:32:15,439 --> 02:32:20,559
mind is very good at constructing dreams

4154
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:23,359
that are nevertheless useful for you

4155
02:32:20,559 --> 02:32:25,439
like they're they're wild and crazy but

4156
02:32:23,359 --> 02:32:27,280
they're such that they are still

4157
02:32:25,439 --> 02:32:29,359
grounded in reality

4158
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:32,159
to a degree where anything you learn in

4159
02:32:29,359 --> 02:32:34,239
dreams might be useful in reality this

4160
02:32:32,159 --> 02:32:35,840
is a very difficult thing to do

4161
02:32:34,239 --> 02:32:38,398
because it requires a lot of

4162
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:40,960
intelligence that requires consciousness

4163
02:32:38,398 --> 02:32:43,439
uh this has been effectively recently

4164
02:32:40,959 --> 02:32:45,919
been used in uh self-supervised learning

4165
02:32:43,439 --> 02:32:47,760
for uh computer vision

4166
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:50,318
with the with the process of what's

4167
02:32:47,760 --> 02:32:53,439
called data augmentation is that's a

4168
02:32:50,318 --> 02:32:56,639
very crude version of dreams which is

4169
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:57,439
you take data and you mess with it

4170
02:32:56,639 --> 02:33:00,239
and

4171
02:32:57,439 --> 02:33:02,559
learn you start to learn how a picture

4172
02:33:00,239 --> 02:33:04,959
of a cat

4173
02:33:02,559 --> 02:33:06,879
truly represents a cat by messing with

4174
02:33:04,959 --> 02:33:08,478
it in different ways

4175
02:33:06,879 --> 02:33:10,559
now the crude methods currently are

4176
02:33:08,478 --> 02:33:12,719
cropping rotating distorting all that

4177
02:33:10,559 --> 02:33:15,039
kind of stuff but you can imagine much

4178
02:33:12,719 --> 02:33:17,279
more complicated

4179
02:33:15,040 --> 02:33:19,600
generative processes that start

4180
02:33:17,280 --> 02:33:21,920
hallucinating different cats in order

4181
02:33:19,600 --> 02:33:23,120
for you to understand deeply of what it

4182
02:33:21,920 --> 02:33:24,879
means

4183
02:33:23,120 --> 02:33:27,040
for something to look like a cat right

4184
02:33:24,879 --> 02:33:29,199
what is the prototype of the archetype

4185
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:30,880
of the cat the archetype i mean that's a

4186
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:32,880
very difficult process for computer

4187
02:33:30,879 --> 02:33:35,920
vision to

4188
02:33:32,879 --> 02:33:38,398
you know to go from what are the pixels

4189
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:40,079
that are usually associated with the cat

4190
02:33:38,398 --> 02:33:43,039
to like

4191
02:33:40,079 --> 02:33:44,879
what is a cat in the visual space in the

4192
02:33:43,040 --> 02:33:46,560
three-dimensional visual space that is

4193
02:33:44,879 --> 02:33:48,559
projected on an image on a

4194
02:33:46,559 --> 02:33:50,079
two-dimensional image

4195
02:33:48,559 --> 02:33:51,519
what is a cat

4196
02:33:50,079 --> 02:33:54,318
those are like fundamentally

4197
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:56,399
philosophical questions that we humans

4198
02:33:54,318 --> 02:33:58,559
don't know the answer to

4199
02:33:56,398 --> 02:34:00,719
like linguistically but when we look at

4200
02:33:58,559 --> 02:34:03,119
a picture of a cat and a dog

4201
02:34:00,719 --> 02:34:04,639
we can usually tell pretty damn well

4202
02:34:03,120 --> 02:34:06,319
what's the difference right and i don't

4203
02:34:04,639 --> 02:34:09,039
know what what that is because you can't

4204
02:34:06,318 --> 02:34:10,000
reduce that to pointy ears or non-pointy

4205
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:12,319
ears

4206
02:34:10,000 --> 02:34:13,680
furry or not furries yeah about the eyes

4207
02:34:12,318 --> 02:34:15,760
it's been a long-standing issue in

4208
02:34:13,680 --> 02:34:16,479
cognitive science cognitive neuroscience

4209
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:19,280
too

4210
02:34:16,478 --> 02:34:22,239
it's how how does the brain create

4211
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:25,520
an archetype how does it create schemas

4212
02:34:22,239 --> 02:34:29,600
that are have general applicability

4213
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:31,280
um but yet still obtain specificity

4214
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:33,920
that's a very difficult

4215
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:36,479
challenge we can do it we do it it's

4216
02:34:33,920 --> 02:34:38,559
yeah rather bloody amazing it seems like

4217
02:34:36,478 --> 02:34:40,959
part of the toolbox is this controlled

4218
02:34:38,559 --> 02:34:44,398
hallucination which is dreams

4219
02:34:40,959 --> 02:34:46,559
well it's a relaxing of the rigid

4220
02:34:44,398 --> 02:34:48,239
constraints you know i often think of

4221
02:34:46,559 --> 02:34:50,559
dreaming as

4222
02:34:48,239 --> 02:34:52,318
you know it's from an information

4223
02:34:50,559 --> 02:34:55,600
processing standpoint

4224
02:34:52,318 --> 02:34:57,519
you know the prison guards are away and

4225
02:34:55,600 --> 02:34:59,840
the prisoners are running a mark in a

4226
02:34:57,520 --> 02:35:01,920
delightful way and part of the reason is

4227
02:34:59,840 --> 02:35:03,840
because when you go into dream sleep the

4228
02:35:01,920 --> 02:35:05,840
rational part of your brain called the

4229
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:07,920
prefrontal cortex which is the part it's

4230
02:35:05,840 --> 02:35:09,920
like the ceo of the brain it's very good

4231
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:12,478
at making high-level rational top-down

4232
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:15,439
decisions and controlled actions

4233
02:35:12,478 --> 02:35:17,199
that part of the brain is shut down

4234
02:35:15,439 --> 02:35:19,760
during rem sleep

4235
02:35:17,200 --> 02:35:24,079
but then emotional centers memory

4236
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:26,478
centers visual centers motoric centers

4237
02:35:24,079 --> 02:35:28,159
all of those centers actually become

4238
02:35:26,478 --> 02:35:29,438
more active in fact some of them are

4239
02:35:28,159 --> 02:35:31,520
more active

4240
02:35:29,439 --> 02:35:33,760
than when we're awake

4241
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:36,479
in the dream state that's fascinating so

4242
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:39,439
your brain from a neural architecture

4243
02:35:36,478 --> 02:35:42,639
perspective is radically different

4244
02:35:39,439 --> 02:35:44,960
its network feature is

4245
02:35:42,639 --> 02:35:45,920
not the same as wakefulness and i think

4246
02:35:44,959 --> 02:35:48,000
this is

4247
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:50,719
an immensely beneficial thing

4248
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:54,079
that we have at least two different

4249
02:35:50,719 --> 02:35:56,559
rational and irrational conscious states

4250
02:35:54,079 --> 02:35:58,879
that we do information processing in the

4251
02:35:56,559 --> 02:36:01,279
rational the veritical the page one of

4252
02:35:58,879 --> 02:36:04,519
the google search is wakefulness

4253
02:36:01,280 --> 02:36:07,680
the more irrational illogical

4254
02:36:04,520 --> 02:36:10,960
hyperassociative google page 20 is the

4255
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:13,120
rem sleep both i think are critical both

4256
02:36:10,959 --> 02:36:14,799
are necessary that's fascinating and

4257
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:17,200
again fascinating to see how that could

4258
02:36:14,799 --> 02:36:18,639
be integrated in the machines to to help

4259
02:36:17,200 --> 02:36:20,319
them learn better

4260
02:36:18,639 --> 02:36:22,478
and to uh

4261
02:36:20,318 --> 02:36:24,719
to reason better

4262
02:36:22,478 --> 02:36:26,318
and in some ways we also know it from a

4263
02:36:24,719 --> 02:36:29,599
chemical perspective too when you go

4264
02:36:26,318 --> 02:36:31,920
into dream sleep it is a neurochemical

4265
02:36:29,600 --> 02:36:34,880
cocktail like no other that we see in

4266
02:36:31,920 --> 02:36:37,600
the at the rest of the 24-hour state

4267
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:40,318
there is a chemical called noradrenaline

4268
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:42,079
or norepinephrine in the brain

4269
02:36:40,318 --> 02:36:44,398
and you know of its cystic chemical in

4270
02:36:42,079 --> 02:36:46,799
the body called adrenaline

4271
02:36:44,398 --> 02:36:48,639
but upstairs in the brain noradrenaline

4272
02:36:46,799 --> 02:36:50,959
is very good at creating a very

4273
02:36:48,639 --> 02:36:52,079
hyper-focused attentive

4274
02:36:50,959 --> 02:36:53,119
narrow

4275
02:36:52,079 --> 02:36:55,280
it's sort of

4276
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:58,399
very

4277
02:36:55,280 --> 02:36:59,280
convergent way of thinking to a point

4278
02:36:58,398 --> 02:37:01,279
sharp

4279
02:36:59,280 --> 02:37:03,359
focus that's the only thing the

4280
02:37:01,280 --> 02:37:05,920
spotlight of consciousness is very

4281
02:37:03,359 --> 02:37:06,960
narrow that's noradrenaline

4282
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:10,478
when you

4283
02:37:06,959 --> 02:37:14,318
remove noradrenaline then you go from a

4284
02:37:10,478 --> 02:37:16,719
high snr a high signal to noise ratio

4285
02:37:14,318 --> 02:37:18,239
where it's just you and i in this moment

4286
02:37:16,719 --> 02:37:20,239
i don't even know what's going on

4287
02:37:18,239 --> 02:37:22,559
elsewhere i am with you

4288
02:37:20,239 --> 02:37:23,680
nor adrenaline is present

4289
02:37:22,559 --> 02:37:25,199
but

4290
02:37:23,680 --> 02:37:27,040
when you go into rem sleep it is the

4291
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:29,200
only time during the 24-hour period

4292
02:37:27,040 --> 02:37:31,600
where your brain is devoid of any

4293
02:37:29,200 --> 02:37:34,000
noradrenaline it is completely shut off

4294
02:37:31,600 --> 02:37:35,760
and so the signal-to-noise ratio is very

4295
02:37:34,000 --> 02:37:38,879
different it's almost as though we're

4296
02:37:35,760 --> 02:37:40,880
injecting a greater amount of noise into

4297
02:37:38,879 --> 02:37:44,239
the neural architecture of the brain

4298
02:37:40,879 --> 02:37:47,358
during dream sleep as if it's chemically

4299
02:37:44,239 --> 02:37:50,719
brute forced into this relaxed

4300
02:37:47,359 --> 02:37:53,200
associative memory processing state and

4301
02:37:50,719 --> 02:37:54,879
then from an anatomical perspective just

4302
02:37:53,200 --> 02:37:56,079
as i described the prefrontal cortex

4303
02:37:54,879 --> 02:37:58,478
goes down

4304
02:37:56,079 --> 02:38:01,600
and other regions light up

4305
02:37:58,478 --> 02:38:05,119
so it is a state that seems to be very i

4306
02:38:01,600 --> 02:38:08,000
mean if you were to show me a brain scan

4307
02:38:05,120 --> 02:38:10,319
of rem sleep and and tell me that it's

4308
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:11,680
not rem sleep just say look based on the

4309
02:38:10,318 --> 02:38:13,680
pattern of this brain activity what

4310
02:38:11,680 --> 02:38:15,439
would you say is going on in this

4311
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:16,720
person's mind i would say well they're

4312
02:38:15,439 --> 02:38:18,398
probably not rational they're probably

4313
02:38:16,719 --> 02:38:19,920
not having logical thought because their

4314
02:38:18,398 --> 02:38:21,599
prefrontal cortex is down they're

4315
02:38:19,920 --> 02:38:23,840
probably feeling very emotional because

4316
02:38:21,600 --> 02:38:25,520
their amygdala is is active which is an

4317
02:38:23,840 --> 02:38:27,200
emotional center of the brain they're

4318
02:38:25,520 --> 02:38:29,040
definitely going to be thinking visually

4319
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:31,120
because the back of the brain is lit up

4320
02:38:29,040 --> 02:38:33,840
the visual cortex it's probably going to

4321
02:38:31,120 --> 02:38:36,160
be filled with past experience

4322
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:37,359
and autobiographical memories because

4323
02:38:36,159 --> 02:38:39,520
their

4324
02:38:37,359 --> 02:38:40,720
their memory centers are lighting up and

4325
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,319
there's probably going to be movement

4326
02:38:40,719 --> 02:38:43,840
because their motor cortex is very

4327
02:38:42,318 --> 02:38:45,760
active

4328
02:38:43,840 --> 02:38:47,359
that to me sounds very much like a dream

4329
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:48,960
and it that's exactly what we see in

4330
02:38:47,359 --> 02:38:50,318
brain scanners when we put people inside

4331
02:38:48,959 --> 02:38:52,079
of them

4332
02:38:50,318 --> 02:38:53,039
one of the things i

4333
02:38:52,079 --> 02:38:57,760
notice

4334
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:59,520
sleep effects is uh my ability to see

4335
02:38:57,760 --> 02:39:00,960
the beauty in the world

4336
02:38:59,520 --> 02:39:02,159
yeah so

4337
02:39:00,959 --> 02:39:03,519
um

4338
02:39:02,159 --> 02:39:05,920
what do you think is the connection

4339
02:39:03,520 --> 02:39:08,800
between sleep in your emotional life

4340
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:11,280
your ability to love other human beings

4341
02:39:08,799 --> 02:39:13,599
and love

4342
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:13,600
life

4343
02:39:13,840 --> 02:39:17,359
yeah

4344
02:39:15,359 --> 02:39:18,399
i think it's

4345
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:20,720
it's very

4346
02:39:18,398 --> 02:39:22,478
powerful and strong so

4347
02:39:20,719 --> 02:39:25,039
we've done a lot of work in the field of

4348
02:39:22,478 --> 02:39:27,760
sleep and emotion and sleeping moods and

4349
02:39:25,040 --> 02:39:29,200
you can separate your emotions into two

4350
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:31,760
main buckets

4351
02:39:29,200 --> 02:39:34,079
um you know positive and negative

4352
02:39:31,760 --> 02:39:36,239
and what's interesting is that when you

4353
02:39:34,079 --> 02:39:39,680
are sleep deprived and the more hours

4354
02:39:36,239 --> 02:39:41,840
that you go into being awake and the few

4355
02:39:39,680 --> 02:39:43,840
hours that you've had to sleep

4356
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:47,120
your

4357
02:39:43,840 --> 02:39:49,600
your negative mood starts to increase

4358
02:39:47,120 --> 02:39:50,960
and and we we know which individual

4359
02:39:49,600 --> 02:39:52,720
types of

4360
02:39:50,959 --> 02:39:55,119
emotions are changing i've got a

4361
02:39:52,719 --> 02:39:56,719
wonderful um postdoc in my lab called

4362
02:39:55,120 --> 02:39:58,800
etti ben simon who's doing some

4363
02:39:56,719 --> 02:40:01,119
incredible work on

4364
02:39:58,799 --> 02:40:04,840
trying to understand the emotional

4365
02:40:01,120 --> 02:40:08,160
individual emotional tapestry

4366
02:40:04,840 --> 02:40:09,680
of affective

4367
02:40:08,159 --> 02:40:11,920
meltdown

4368
02:40:09,680 --> 02:40:14,000
when you're not getting sufficient sleep

4369
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:15,840
but let's just keep with two dimensions

4370
02:40:14,000 --> 02:40:17,520
positive and negative yes

4371
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:18,960
the negative most people would think

4372
02:40:17,520 --> 02:40:20,880
well it's the negative that takes the

4373
02:40:18,959 --> 02:40:22,318
biggest hit when i'm sleep deprived it's

4374
02:40:20,879 --> 02:40:24,879
not

4375
02:40:22,318 --> 02:40:25,920
by probably in a log order magnitude

4376
02:40:24,879 --> 02:40:28,879
larger

4377
02:40:25,920 --> 02:40:32,318
is a hit on your positive emotions

4378
02:40:28,879 --> 02:40:34,000
in other words you stop

4379
02:40:32,318 --> 02:40:35,920
gaining pleasure from normally

4380
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:38,239
pleasurable things and it's a state that

4381
02:40:35,920 --> 02:40:39,920
we call anhedonia

4382
02:40:38,239 --> 02:40:42,559
and anhedonia

4383
02:40:39,920 --> 02:40:45,040
is the state that we often call

4384
02:40:42,559 --> 02:40:46,559
depression so depression

4385
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:49,120
to most people's surprise isn't

4386
02:40:46,559 --> 02:40:52,478
necessarily that you're

4387
02:40:49,120 --> 02:40:55,439
always feeling negative emotions it's

4388
02:40:52,478 --> 02:40:58,559
often more about the fact that you lose

4389
02:40:55,439 --> 02:41:00,880
the pleasure in the good things in life

4390
02:40:58,559 --> 02:41:02,559
that's what we call anhedonia that's

4391
02:41:00,879 --> 02:41:04,318
what we see in sleep

4392
02:41:02,559 --> 02:41:06,159
and insufficient sleep and it happens

4393
02:41:04,318 --> 02:41:08,318
quite quickly yeah it's kind of

4394
02:41:06,159 --> 02:41:09,680
fascinating i um

4395
02:41:08,318 --> 02:41:12,639
i think i do

4396
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:15,359
it's not depression but like it's uh

4397
02:41:12,639 --> 02:41:18,000
it's a stroll into that direction which

4398
02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:21,279
is when i'm sleep deprived i stopped

4399
02:41:18,000 --> 02:41:23,600
being able to see the meaning in life

4400
02:41:21,279 --> 02:41:26,319
the things that gave me meanings starts

4401
02:41:23,600 --> 02:41:28,880
to lose meaning like stupid i it makes

4402
02:41:26,318 --> 02:41:31,119
me realize how enjoyable everything is

4403
02:41:28,879 --> 02:41:33,599
in my life because when i start to lose

4404
02:41:31,120 --> 02:41:35,439
it when i'm severely sleep deprived you

4405
02:41:33,600 --> 02:41:37,760
start to see how much life sucks when

4406
02:41:35,439 --> 02:41:40,159
you lose it but that said when i'm just

4407
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:43,359
cognizant enough that like sleep fixes

4408
02:41:40,159 --> 02:41:46,639
all that so i use those states for what

4409
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:49,120
they're worth in fact i personally

4410
02:41:46,639 --> 02:41:50,079
like to pay attention to the things that

4411
02:41:49,120 --> 02:41:52,640
uh

4412
02:41:50,079 --> 02:41:55,120
bother me in during that time

4413
02:41:52,639 --> 02:41:58,478
because they also reveal

4414
02:41:55,120 --> 02:41:58,479
important information to me

4415
02:42:01,439 --> 02:42:05,920
yeah i mean there's so i i find this

4416
02:42:04,159 --> 02:42:07,920
when i fast combined with sleep

4417
02:42:05,920 --> 02:42:10,719
deprivation

4418
02:42:07,920 --> 02:42:12,960
i am clear to see with people

4419
02:42:10,719 --> 02:42:15,599
clear and identifying the things that

4420
02:42:12,959 --> 02:42:17,278
are not going right in my life

4421
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:18,720
or um

4422
02:42:17,279 --> 02:42:20,399
people that i'm working with are not

4423
02:42:18,719 --> 02:42:21,358
doing as good of a job as they could be

4424
02:42:20,398 --> 02:42:22,879
doing

4425
02:42:21,359 --> 02:42:24,559
um like

4426
02:42:22,879 --> 02:42:27,358
people that are negative

4427
02:42:24,559 --> 02:42:30,239
uh in my life i'm more able to identify

4428
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:32,318
them so i don't act on that it's a very

4429
02:42:30,239 --> 02:42:34,799
bad time to act on those decisions but

4430
02:42:32,318 --> 02:42:36,719
you get quite well made recording

4431
02:42:34,799 --> 02:42:39,278
recording that information

4432
02:42:36,719 --> 02:42:41,840
because i usually when i'm well rested

4433
02:42:39,279 --> 02:42:43,920
and happy i see the beauty in everybody

4434
02:42:41,840 --> 02:42:45,680
which can get you into trouble

4435
02:42:43,920 --> 02:42:47,359
so yeah you have to balance those two

4436
02:42:45,680 --> 02:42:49,680
things but yes it's fascinating there's

4437
02:42:47,359 --> 02:42:51,279
an irony there too which is the fact

4438
02:42:49,680 --> 02:42:53,359
that you know when you're well rested

4439
02:42:51,279 --> 02:42:55,600
and well slept just as you said you see

4440
02:42:53,359 --> 02:42:57,439
the the beauty in life and it sort of

4441
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:59,680
enlivens you and

4442
02:42:57,439 --> 02:43:02,720
sort of gives you a

4443
02:42:59,680 --> 02:43:04,800
quality of of life that's emotionally

4444
02:43:02,719 --> 02:43:07,278
very different

4445
02:43:04,799 --> 02:43:09,840
yet then

4446
02:43:07,279 --> 02:43:09,840
we are

4447
02:43:11,120 --> 02:43:16,720
contrasting that against the need for

4448
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:18,159
not getting enough sleep because of the

4449
02:43:16,719 --> 02:43:20,719
beautiful things that you want to

4450
02:43:18,159 --> 02:43:25,279
accomplish in life

4451
02:43:20,719 --> 02:43:25,278
and i don't actually see them as

4452
02:43:25,840 --> 02:43:30,880
you know sort of completely

4453
02:43:28,318 --> 02:43:32,719
counter-intuitive or paradoxical because

4454
02:43:30,879 --> 02:43:34,239
i still think that you can strive for

4455
02:43:32,719 --> 02:43:37,119
all of the brilliant things that you are

4456
02:43:34,239 --> 02:43:40,239
striving for to have the monumental

4457
02:43:37,120 --> 02:43:43,439
goals the herculean challenges that you

4458
02:43:40,239 --> 02:43:45,760
wish to take on and solve

4459
02:43:43,439 --> 02:43:48,079
they can still enthrall you and excite

4460
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:49,120
you and stimulate you

4461
02:43:48,079 --> 02:43:51,120
but

4462
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:53,040
because of the insufficient sleep that

4463
02:43:51,120 --> 02:43:55,279
they can or that

4464
02:43:53,040 --> 02:43:58,479
goal can produce

4465
02:43:55,279 --> 02:44:00,720
it will shave off

4466
02:43:58,478 --> 02:44:02,559
the beauty of life that you experience

4467
02:44:00,719 --> 02:44:05,278
in between and again this is just about

4468
02:44:02,559 --> 02:44:07,199
the trade-off i will say though that and

4469
02:44:05,279 --> 02:44:11,279
this is not um

4470
02:44:07,200 --> 02:44:14,319
applicable to your circumstance um

4471
02:44:11,279 --> 02:44:17,120
we do know that insufficient sleep

4472
02:44:14,318 --> 02:44:18,719
is very strongly linked to suicide

4473
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:20,399
ideation

4474
02:44:18,719 --> 02:44:22,318
suicide attempts

4475
02:44:20,398 --> 02:44:24,000
and tragically suicide completion as

4476
02:44:22,318 --> 02:44:27,199
well

4477
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:28,079
and in fact in 20 years of studying

4478
02:44:27,200 --> 02:44:29,840
sleep

4479
02:44:28,079 --> 02:44:31,760
we have not been able to discover a

4480
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:34,559
single psychiatric condition in which

4481
02:44:31,760 --> 02:44:36,960
sleep is normal

4482
02:44:34,559 --> 02:44:39,199
and i think that that is a profound

4483
02:44:36,959 --> 02:44:40,159
state i think it tells us so much

4484
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:42,880
about

4485
02:44:40,159 --> 02:44:45,359
the role of sleep as a potential causal

4486
02:44:42,879 --> 02:44:46,959
agent in psychiatric conditions i also

4487
02:44:45,359 --> 02:44:48,960
think it's a potential

4488
02:44:46,959 --> 02:44:51,199
sign that we should be using sleep as a

4489
02:44:48,959 --> 02:44:53,199
tool yeah for the prevention of grave

4490
02:44:51,200 --> 02:44:53,840
mental illness yeah it's both a cause

4491
02:44:53,200 --> 02:44:56,560
and

4492
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:58,559
and a solution so yeah i i mean me

4493
02:44:56,559 --> 02:44:59,680
personally i've gone through a few dark

4494
02:44:58,559 --> 02:45:02,639
periods

4495
02:44:59,680 --> 02:45:06,079
up quite recently and it was almost

4496
02:45:02,639 --> 02:45:09,199
always sleep is not the cause

4497
02:45:06,079 --> 02:45:12,318
but sleep is the catalyst from going to

4498
02:45:09,200 --> 02:45:14,479
a bad time to a very bad time

4499
02:45:12,318 --> 02:45:16,398
yeah and so it's it's

4500
02:45:14,478 --> 02:45:18,639
definitely true and it's funny how sleep

4501
02:45:16,398 --> 02:45:20,239
can just cure all of that there's

4502
02:45:18,639 --> 02:45:22,959
actually a beautiful quote by an

4503
02:45:20,239 --> 02:45:24,159
american entrepreneur called e joseph

4504
02:45:22,959 --> 02:45:26,000
kosman

4505
02:45:24,159 --> 02:45:28,719
who once said that the best bridge

4506
02:45:26,000 --> 02:45:30,719
between despair and hope is a good

4507
02:45:28,719 --> 02:45:34,079
night's sleep

4508
02:45:30,719 --> 02:45:37,039
and i spill

4509
02:45:34,079 --> 02:45:38,959
so much ink and hundreds of pages

4510
02:45:37,040 --> 02:45:40,080
inelegantly trying to say the same thing

4511
02:45:38,959 --> 02:45:42,478
in my book

4512
02:45:40,079 --> 02:45:45,200
and he said it in one line and

4513
02:45:42,478 --> 02:45:46,959
it's beautiful what do you think is uh

4514
02:45:45,200 --> 02:45:49,680
we've been talking about how to extend

4515
02:45:46,959 --> 02:45:52,318
this life how to make it a good life

4516
02:45:49,680 --> 02:45:53,200
i've been talking about uh

4517
02:45:52,318 --> 02:45:54,559
love

4518
02:45:53,200 --> 02:45:57,680
what do you think is the meaning of this

4519
02:45:54,559 --> 02:45:59,519
whole ride of life of life why do we

4520
02:45:57,680 --> 02:46:01,359
want to make it

4521
02:45:59,520 --> 02:46:03,040
a good one do you think there's a

4522
02:46:01,359 --> 02:46:05,439
meaning do you think there's a answer to

4523
02:46:03,040 --> 02:46:05,439
the why

4524
02:46:05,600 --> 02:46:08,479
for me personally

4525
02:46:09,120 --> 02:46:13,600
i think

4526
02:46:10,398 --> 02:46:13,599
the meaning of life is

4527
02:46:13,760 --> 02:46:19,359
is to eat is to sleep

4528
02:46:16,559 --> 02:46:22,159
is to fall in love

4529
02:46:19,359 --> 02:46:22,159
is to cry

4530
02:46:22,639 --> 02:46:25,840
and then to die

4531
02:46:27,120 --> 02:46:31,840
oh and probably race cars in between

4532
02:46:29,520 --> 02:46:33,680
race cars well there's a whole topic of

4533
02:46:31,840 --> 02:46:36,000
uh sex we didn't talk about so that's

4534
02:46:33,680 --> 02:46:38,000
probably in there so should we do that

4535
02:46:36,000 --> 02:46:39,680
we'll maybe if you'll have me back yeah

4536
02:46:38,000 --> 02:46:41,680
that's the following i will give around

4537
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:44,318
next time we will do another three hours

4538
02:46:41,680 --> 02:46:46,239
on sex alone has it been yeah

4539
02:46:44,318 --> 02:46:49,760
it has been uh it's been over three

4540
02:46:46,239 --> 02:46:51,119

4572
02:47:48,959 --> 02:47:53,438
from nikola tesla who we discussed in

4573
02:47:51,359 --> 02:47:55,200
this podcast as sleeping very few hours

4574
02:47:53,439 --> 02:47:56,720
a night

4575
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:58,960
all that was great in the past was

4576
02:47:56,719 --> 02:48:01,519
ridiculed condemned combatted and

4577
02:47:58,959 --> 02:48:02,639
suppressed only to emerge all the more

4578
02:48:01,520 --> 02:48:04,720
powerfully

4579
02:48:02,639 --> 02:48:06,239
all the more triumphantly from the

4580
02:48:04,719 --> 02:48:07,760
struggle

4581
02:48:06,239 --> 02:48:11,559
