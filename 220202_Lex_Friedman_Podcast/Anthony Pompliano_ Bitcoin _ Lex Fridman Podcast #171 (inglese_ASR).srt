ideas

36
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,240

some communities

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,040
are a bit more intense in their style of

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,438
communication and

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,280

ideas

i personally try to like to approach

48
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,200
conversations by considering that

49
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,879
i may be wrong about everything and i'm

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,439

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,560
pompliano you served in the u.s army for

75
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,000
six years and spent

76
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,598
13 months in iraq in 2008 and 9.

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,759
can you tell the story of why you joined

78
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:43,759
the army and what were

79
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:45,359
some of the moving difficult and maybe

80
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:46,079
lasting experiences from the time you

81
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,959
served

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,920
sure i joined when i was 17 years old i

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:54,878
needed my parents to uh basically sign

84
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,159
in order to uh to join and uh i

85
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:57,598
graduated semester early from high

86
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,280
school and i thought i was going to play

87
00:02:57,598 --> 00:03:00,479
football in college and kind of enroll

88
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,759
in the spring semester and when that

89
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:03,679
didn't happen

90
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,598
basically was working at a chick-fil-a

91
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,599
and quiznos

92
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:09,598
had in my mind look this is probably not

93
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:10,878
the uh the path in life that i want

94
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:11,919
um and so i knew i was gonna go to

95
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,359
college i knew i was gonna go play

96
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,598
football in the fall but i had this

97
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,640
window of time and so i walked into a

98
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:18,719
recruiting

99
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,559
office and just basically was like i'm

100
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,639
assuming you guys need some help

101
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,239
and uh yeah they gave me the whole pitch

102
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,919
and uh you know give you a signing bonus

103
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,280
you can go jump out of planes and go do

104
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,759
all this crazy stuff

105
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
i just said okay let's do it this was

106
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:35,598
this was close to 911.

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,840
this was in 2006 about five years after

108
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,518
so what uh impact i mean do you remember

109
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
911 what impact did that have when

110
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,080
you're thinking about this

111
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,959
so i was uh in eighth grade um if i

112
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,080
remember correctly

113
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,039
and i remember being in school

114
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,920
when it happened and uh i walked into a

115
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,318
classroom

116
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,079
and the entire class uh somebody else's

117
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,199
class they were all

118
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,560
talking to the teacher about something

119
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:00,000
the second that me and a couple other

120
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,199
kids walked in and got real quiet and

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,479
the teacher was like hey go back to your

122
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,919
like home room

123
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,158
and so it's just kind of a weird like

124
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,559
what's going on uh and then next thing i

125
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:07,919
know

126
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,759
they called all the students into the

127
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:10,559
cafeteria and this is back before you

128
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,560
know every

129
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
classroom really had a television in it

130
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,640
and you know cable and all that kind of

131
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,759
stuff

132
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,599
and so when we were there they basically

133
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:18,079
just said listen there's been this uh

134
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,359
event

135
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,439
that's occurred all of your parents are

136
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,959
gonna come pick you guys up and uh

137
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,439
they'll explain it to you

138
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,959
and so to you know a kid in eighth grade

139
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,519
you're basically like

140
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:30,959
what happened and so i got home and i

141
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,519
remember talking to my dad about it

142
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,079
and my dad basically gave me you know

143
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:36,240
the uh

144
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,918
the core american kind of talking points

145
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,720
right somebody from another country

146
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,000
came here and tried to kill americans

147
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,600
and was successful in doing

148
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,959
that um and to some extent he just said

149
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,479
and i'm willing to bet you know we're

150
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:50,000
going to go back after him did that wake

151
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:51,439
you up a little bit to the idea that

152
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,360
there's evil out there that

153
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:55,519
you know even just the idea of terrorism

154
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,319
for many people that was um

155
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:58,799
when it hits you on your own land it's a

156
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,439
it

157
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,800
really shakes up your mind in some sense

158
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:04,800
world war ii

159
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,560
that's why world war ii was

160
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,960
fundamentally different for americans

161
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,839
than

162
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:11,038
it is for people like in russia in

163
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,959
england and france

164
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:17,599
and in europe in general is

165
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:19,680
there's something about when there's

166
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:23,199
families women children dying

167
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,360
on your own land that's different

168
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,439
and that was one of the first times in

169
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,520
america where like on euro

170
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,360
of course it's pearl harbor but like

171
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,639
this is like in recent history

172
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,680
it's like they hit us here

173
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,519
that was like a profound idea i think

174
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,680
america was very very good at exporting

175
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:43,918
the violence elsewhere for a long time

176
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,038
and uh there was this element of uh

177
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,240
complacency

178
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,918
but also this element of uh um you know

179
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,519
really just american superiority that

180
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,519
doesn't happen here right

181
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:54,639
and i think that that woke people up not

182
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,198
only to

183
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,639
um kind of the idea that other places

184
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,639
around the world may not like the

185
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,918
american ideals may not like democracy

186
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,280
and capitalism and

187
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:07,439
and that but also maybe we aren't as

188
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,198
big tough and secure as we thought we

189
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,000
were right and so obviously i think you

190
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,840
see the kind of over

191
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,279
rotation with a lot of the kind of

192
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:15,038
security theater that came

193
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:16,638
after that of almost psychologically

194
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:18,318
let's make our citizens feel

195
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,000
like they're safe even if the things

196
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,919
that we're doing don't necessarily you

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,439
know kind of change that apparatus

198
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,279
but on top of that i think that it

199
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,478
really woke people up to

200
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,399
uh extremism around the world and uh

201
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:31,839
i don't know if necessarily there was a

202
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,679
change in the extremism

203
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:35,599
as much as it just was an awareness

204
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,759
thing right how many people

205
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,360
you know kind of drew a line from was it

206
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,080
92 or 93 with the

207
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,639
world trade center bombing to you know

208
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,639
deep levels of extremism and hatred of

209
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,280
kind of the american industrial complex

210
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,120
probably not that many 2001

211
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,799
a lot of people and so i think that was

212
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,160
you know again as a young kid

213
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,240
you don't understand a lot of this stuff

214
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,439
you basically just hey somebody came

215
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,918
here and tried to

216
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:00,879
kill americans and so you know we should

217
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,879
go fight back

218
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,079
right was kind of the the response i

219
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,560
think that i had

220
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,439
what role did that have psychologically

221
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,720
for you when you

222
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:13,439
then in 2006 joined the army i mean

223
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,319
this is very different joining the army

224
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,519
than

225
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,160
in the time when like it's more peaceful

226
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,519
here you're essentially facing i mean i

227
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,199
don't know if you see it that way but

228
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:24,079
you know there is a war on terror and i

229
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,639
know that people

230
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,478
kind of uh criticize that whole

231
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,439
formulation framework of thinking but

232
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:31,680
nevertheless

233
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:32,800
you are going to iraq you are going to

234
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,959
afghanistan you're

235
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,560
you're going to these places and are

236
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:39,519
fighting these complicated

237
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,478
like i mean it's not even clear what

238
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,719
you're fighting

239
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,318
yeah well i think there's a couple of

240
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,879
key pieces right so one like one of

241
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,639
the actual most impactful data points if

242
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,800
you were or kind of stories for me

243
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,639
uh was the pat tillman story so i played

244
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,919
football uh in high school and i was

245
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,478
gonna go play in college

246
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,560
um and seeing you know this nfl player

247
00:07:56,478 --> 00:08:00,719
who basically just one day said hey i'm

248
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,959
going to go and do this instead

249
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,919
and walk away i don't know necessarily

250
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,239
if it was a

251
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,038
i want to pursue the same story right

252
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
and obviously he

253
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,159
ended up dying and so not exactly the

254
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,400
the end result that you want

255
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,520
but i think it was almost like uh he

256
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,959
made it okay

257
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,878
if you were on a certain trajectory in

258
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,120
life to go take this detour

259
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,639
and and to go do it um but the second

260
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,918
thing is i was 17.

261
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,840
you're pretty stupid when you're 17.

262
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,878
you're pretty naive when you're 17 right

263
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,439
and so uh i almost um kind of backed

264
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,240
into

265
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,719
the deployment because i signed up uh as

266
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,959
a

267
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,800
a reserve member and so basically the

268
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,079
plan was to sign up for the reserves i

269
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:37,759
was going to go to basic training get

270
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,639
all the you know kind of education and

271
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:40,158
qualification

272
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,000
i was going to go to college and then

273
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,000
after college you know maybe there's a

274
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,039
chance that you will go and serve or do

275
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,799
whatever

276
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:48,719
for me i ended up getting deployed when

277
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:50,159
i was a junior in uh college so i got

278
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,200
pulled out of school

279
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,719
and so at 20 years old it's not exactly

280
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,640
what you thought you were signing up for

281
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,800
right especially to kind of leave school

282
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,120
to go do it and then on top of that

283
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:02,559
uh i probably had an advantage over most

284
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,600
people both on the

285
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:06,958
entry to combat and the exit to kind of

286
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,680
a combat situation which

287
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,319
was football so i always explained that

288
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:13,519
um

289
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,600
in hindsight you're in a male-dominated

290
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,240
testosterone driven kind of combative

291
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,320
sport

292
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,440
where it's us first them and and uh

293
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,360
there's training and

294
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
and uh you know injuries and just kind

295
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,720
of all of the things that go into

296
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,560
playing a combat sport like football

297
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,800
to now they give you guns but you still

298
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,399
have a uniform on still male dominated

299
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,559
it's just a little bit you know more

300
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,559
serious in terms of the injuries and and

301
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:37,278
potential death and things like that but

302
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:39,119
also on the exit from that deployment

303
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,720
most guys i was there with they're going

304
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,600
back to being you know

305
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,879
prison guards police officers working at

306
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,480
the lumber yard

307
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:51,200
you know just kind of everyday americans

308
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,240
and so i had the fortunate ability to go

309
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,759
back into

310
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,278
uh kind of that combative environment go

311
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,879
back to play football and so it was

312
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:57,838
almost this like de-escalation on the

313
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,600
way out

314
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,760
uh where they take your guns away we

315
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,360
still got a uniform still male dominated

316
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:04,958
uh still combative and then eventually

317
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,800
you're just a normal citizen

318
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,319
and so i think that in some weird way i

319
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:08,799
was you know very fortunate to kind of

320
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
on the

321
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,000
entry and exit have that experience

322
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,278
where other guys didn't

323
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,320
so what you were deployed to iraq

324
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,838
were there any memories experiences that

325
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,160
changed you

326
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,160
or in general like you're probably a

327
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,319
different man on the other side of it

328
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:27,519
how did that time change you i think

329
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,600
there was two main

330
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,839
takeaways that i took right so one was

331
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,639
um not a specific moment but on multiple

332
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,640
occasions

333
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,639
i remember we were driving down the road

334
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,360
and i would look and there would be a

335
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:40,879
10 12 14 year old kid and if you've

336
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,360
never seen somebody who

337
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,958
literally has hate and disdain in their

338
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,800
eyes towards you

339
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,479
just not necessarily to you personally

340
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:50,240
just to the uniform to what you stand

341
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,920
for it's all the stuff

342
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,360
when you see it you see it right and i

343
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,759
always think of um

344
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,480
if you've ever uh watched the movie a 12

345
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,480
strong

346
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,159
and in it they've got this afghan

347
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,000
afghanistan warlord and he's

348
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:03,600
talking to a bunch of soldiers and he

349
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
says you know you don't have killer eyes

350
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,800
you do you do and he's just like he can

351
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,839
just tell right he's seen so many

352
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,639
soldiers

353
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,240
and so i think that that was a a memory

354
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,600
on a number of occasions where i just

355
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,639
saw a young kid

356
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,278
and i just said they hate us right and

357
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,199
and it's not

358
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,200
you personally it's what you stand for

359
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,680
but the the really big event was

360
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,600
when you first get to these combat zones

361
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,000
a lot of times what will happen is

362
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,879
you basically your unit teams up with a

363
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,240
unit that's leaving

364
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,519
and there's a handoff and it happens

365
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,480
over a couple of weeks and so you can

366
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,919
imagine almost

367
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,159
you know one percent of our team goes

368
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:38,799
out with 99 of their team then 5

369
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,000
95 10 90 all the way till it's 50 50 and

370
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,359
then eventually it rotates and then it's

371
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,919
majority of our team and

372
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,600
a small number of their team and so what

373
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:47,278
a lot of people will explain is the two

374
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,800
most dangerous times in war

375
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,879
are actually the first two or three

376
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,000
weeks in the last two or three weeks

377
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,278
when you first get there you don't know

378
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,559
who the people are you don't know the

379
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,799
terrain you don't know

380
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:58,399
you know kind of the local cultures and

381
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,120
who to look out for what signs all that

382
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,720
kind of stuff

383
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,159
and the last two or three weeks is you

384
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,120
basically think you've survived the

385
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,399
deployment you're looking forward to

386
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,679
going home so you become complacent

387
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,039
things like that

388
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,958
and so we made it through that

389
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,039
transition period with no issues

390
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:12,638
uh but the literally the very first

391
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,679
mission uh that we went out

392
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:17,759
as a team ourselves 100 um

393
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,278
there was two separate incidents uh one

394
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,319
was we were driving in milanite

395
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:22,639
and uh what we think was a sniper shot

396
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
at

397
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,320
a truck that i was in i was standing up

398
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,879
outside of it along with a

399
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,480
another guy and that was kind of just a

400
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,720
wake-up call again of

401
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,680
never been shot up before right and so

402
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,000
i'll never forget

403
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,159
uh you kind of heard this whiz go by and

404
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,679
the guy next to me was from rural

405
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:40,879
pennsylvania and he just said

406
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:41,919
you know look i've never been shot at

407
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:44,799
before either but i've done a lot of

408
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:47,679
hunting get the [ __ ] down

409
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,240
okay and so uh we kept driving that

410
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,838
night

411
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,159
um and uh later on in the night uh an

412
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,160
ied went off a guy ran over an ied

413
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,078
uh who was at the front of the convoy

414
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:00,639
and when that ied went off

415
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,159
uh again i had never been in a convoy

416
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,120
that had been blown up before but the

417
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,480
training kicks in

418
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,320
and so immediately every single person

419
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,680
starts screaming out ied ied and they

420
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,040
start looking and trying to figure it

421
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,719
out and you realize

422
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:13,360
the united states military did a

423
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,040
fantastic job training us before we went

424
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,800
because in that moment nobody thought

425
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,719
about anything you just did what you had

426
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,479
been programmed to do

427
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,320
and so ultimately kind of through the

428
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,839
end of that event uh there was u.s

429
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,879
soldier that ended up dying he was uh

430
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,160
shot in the head

431
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:30,159
and um when we got back to the base uh

432
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:33,199
kind of after that entire event

433
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:34,799
i think it just hit us we are at war and

434
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,040
if we make mistakes here

435
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:38,159
that is the cost of you know kind of

436
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:40,559
those mistakes

437
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,159
and this was somebody who i didn't know

438
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:42,719
uh it was somebody who literally showed

439
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:45,278
up

440
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,079
kind of as secondary support for our

441
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,958
unit

442
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:50,638
and basically uh was there to help us

443
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:52,000
right and so it was one of those weird

444
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,759
situations where

445
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,360
uh you have this emotional connection

446
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,519
because it's somebody who

447
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,399
uh shared an event with you but you

448
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,240
didn't know them

449
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,679
right and you learn their name later and

450
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,879
you understand that they have a family

451
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:03,519
and they have young kids and all this

452
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:05,278
stuff

453
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,879
and so again as a 20 year old kid you're

454
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:08,000
kind of processing all this and you just

455
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,078
realize like

456
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,278
the gun i have in my arm my hands it's

457
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,319
real for a reason

458
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,159
right and we better take this seriously

459
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,160
this is not you know us joking around

460
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,439
in kind of the barracks and you know all

461
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,120
the things that you would expect

462
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,800
you know guys are doing the army so i

463
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,519
think that was like the moment where i

464
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,679
said

465
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,879
hey i'm going to learn a lot here uh and

466
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:28,799
i got to make sure i get home

467
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:30,639
and you snapping into the training but

468
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:32,159
nevertheless i mean you're somebody who

469
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,560
thinks philosophically about this world

470
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,278
now

471
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:36,319
right you're uh very intelligent and

472
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,519
thinks deeply about

473
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:42,639
the world so looking back you mentioned

474
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,639
hatred in the 14 year old kids eyes

475
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,639
there's death so the way you kind of

476
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,519
describe this whole story

477
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,959
is like training kicks in this this [ __ ]

478
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,120
is serious

479
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,239
like this is uh you know there's a

480
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,799
reason there's a gun

481
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,480
in your hand so there's a strategic

482
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:00,399
element there's like you have to get the

483
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,879
job done there's a task at hand

484
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,480
but at the same time if you zoom out

485
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,919
there's a kid

486
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,519
who has hate for you some of those kids

487
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:12,159
would probably if they could

488
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,839
would kill you for the thing you stand

489
00:15:12,159 --> 00:15:17,360
for in the uniform

490
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:20,000
and then there's bullets flying at you

491
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,560
and then there's people that some of

492
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,039
them

493
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,239
you might already care for deeply are

494
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,439
dying

495
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:29,360
what the hell do you make of that

496
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,040
do you think about that does any of that

497
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,879
haunt you

498
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:34,159
how do you think about the world having

499
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:36,799
witnessed that

500
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:38,159
yeah a lot of times when we would talk

501
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:40,799
about it we were there

502
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:41,759
if i was that kid i would want to kill

503
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,919
that person too

504
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,680
right i would have hatred as well right

505
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:47,838
imagine if in the united states

506
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:49,519
tomorrow you and i woke up and there was

507
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,560
tanks rolling down the street from

508
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,480
another country

509
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:54,239
yeah and they were basically imposing

510
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,759
their rules on us

511
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,278
whether they thought it was the right

512
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,639
thing to do or not the soldiers were

513
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,559
there they were doing this

514
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,639
we would probably feel not so great

515
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,239
about it right at kind of a minimum

516
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,759
and at a maximum we'd be really really

517
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,839
pissed off we would fight back

518
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,360
and so what you don't understand when

519
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,360
you're in the heat of the moment is

520
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,440
why does this person feel this way and

521
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,399
so what's very weird

522
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,000
is well what happens if a year ago u.s

523
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,159
soldiers came through

524
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,399
they got shot at they returned fire and

525
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:24,799
they killed that kid's uncle

526
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,559
you'd be pissed off right and so you

527
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,399
just start to understand like

528
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,679
we look at war very black and white we

529
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,440
look at it very much

530
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,359
from a clinical perspective we're going

531
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,480
to go we're going to go kind of invade

532
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,240
somewhere

533
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,159
we are the most dominant military in the

534
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,519
world we're very good at invading

535
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:42,639
uh and we will crush wherever we invade

536
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,240
but when you're actually on the ground

537
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,879
what you understand is the humanity of

538
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,480
it all

539
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,078
right and so what becomes very

540
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,519
interesting is uh

541
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:51,599
pretty much every veteran i know that

542
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,879
comes back they're some of the largest

543
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,720
pacifists in the world

544
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,958
and i always revert back to uh marcus

545
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,879
latrell uh who's a famous navy seal

546
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:01,039
um and there's a movie made about him

547
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,600
and his story uh he gave a speech one

548
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:04,078
time

549
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,919
that i saw and he basically said listen

550
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:07,599
if you're a politician your job is to

551
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:09,280
be the diplomat do everything you

552
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,078
possibly can not to send me and my

553
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,918
friends

554
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,678
anywhere because when you send us we're

555
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,520
gonna bring hell with us

556
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,120
right and understand that is the

557
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,038
business that we are in

558
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,119
but every single other person up until

559
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,318
we get sent has a job to do to prevent

560
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,838
having to send us

561
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:25,759
and i think that ultimately that's where

562
00:17:23,838 --> 00:17:27,918
you see a lot of kind of this generation

563
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,480
that is fought in iraq and afghanistan

564
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,840
that says listen maybe we shouldn't be

565
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,558
running around the world being the

566
00:17:31,839 --> 00:17:34,319
police

567
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,678
maybe we shouldn't be going and invading

568
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,519
all these different countries

569
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,519
because when you actually get to see

570
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:40,960
firsthand what happens

571
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:43,279
it's just something that we should avoid

572
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,600
at all cost but if we have to go

573
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:46,399
or we have to actually send soldiers

574
00:17:45,599 --> 00:17:48,798
somewhere

575
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,000
understand what happens when that occurs

576
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:51,839
and you know the united states is the

577
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,480
best in the world of doing it

578
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,159
do you think i'm thinking about that kid

579
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,759
with a hatred do you think there will

580
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,720
always be hatred in the world

581
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:02,480
do you think from another perspective do

582
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,798
you think there'll be war

583
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,839
always is that a fundamental aspect of

584
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,558
human nature

585
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,279
or is that something we can escape yeah

586
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:10,720
so war

587
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,480
i think has like very negative

588
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,519
connotations in terms of bullets and

589
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,919
bombs and death

590
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:20,960
and kind of just very morbid type um

591
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,400
understanding conflict on the other hand

592
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,919
i think people look at and say of course

593
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,880
there'll always be conflict right you

594
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,559
just can't have

595
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,080
billions of people all on the same

596
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,119
planet without some level of

597
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:30,480
disagreement whether that's a

598
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,319
disagreement of ideas

599
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,558
disagreement over physical you know

600
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:36,000
geography or something else and so i

601
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:39,038
think conflict will always

602
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,400
exist the question is what form does war

603
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:42,879
take moving forward

604
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,559
and so in my mind you know it's starting

605
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,559
to look a lot more clinical

606
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,000
right a lot more drones a lot less

607
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:49,759
soldiers on the ground

608
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,519
a lot more use of special forces and

609
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,279
kind of these small highly specialized

610
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,000
teams rather than kind of big mechanical

611
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,440
armies

612
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,599
um and then you get into like the

613
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,919
information warfare and kind of cyber

614
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,359
warfare and you start to understand that

615
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,120
we're at war with a lot of people right

616
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:05,279
now right doesn't mean we're necessarily

617
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,319
dropping bombs uh on their countries

618
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:08,639
it doesn't necessarily mean we're

619
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,558
sending soldiers there but on a daily

620
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:13,038
basis we are engaged in these kind of

621
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:15,200
you know cyber battlefields and so if

622
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,759
that's where war starts to play out

623
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
um it one changes the tools and tactics

624
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,960
and techniques that

625
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,639
we need to arm our country and other

626
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,480
countries will arm themselves with

627
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,919
but it also changes the way that we

628
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,480
think about war right

629
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,520
it see it sounds a lot less uh worrisome

630
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,038
if i say hey

631
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,079
we're going to go to war with a country

632
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,359
but by the way there's going to be no

633
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,798
death

634
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,240
right okay like that doesn't sound

635
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,079
nearly as bad as hey we're going to go

636
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,359
send 10 000 soldiers and you know some

637
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:40,639
percentage of them are gonna die on the

638
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,798
battlefield and then we're gonna

639
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,679
you know basically pipe back videos and

640
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:45,440
articles

641
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,519
saying that american soldiers are dying

642
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,880
yeah it does seem to be a fundamental

643
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,079
difference between the

644
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,400
the genghis khan style like if i would

645
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,240
feel

646
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:59,280
differently if somebody

647
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,400
like hand to hand with a knife murder my

648
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,200
family

649
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,159
versus cyber security where i stole all

650
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,558
their data

651
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,440
stole all their money stole everything

652
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,200
they owned

653
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,720
falsified their identity all that kind

654
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,759
of stuff that

655
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,319
those are both traumatic events

656
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,679
but they do seem to be fundamentally

657
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:20,480
different but maybe that's

658
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,759
actually very narrow style thinking

659
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,440
because

660
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,679
ultimately you have to think about what

661
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,679
is life and what's happiness

662
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:33,120
and it's like the samurai thinking

663
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,038
i'm not sure what's more painful if i

664
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,558
take it to myself like i'm not sure what

665
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:39,919
i would rather

666
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:43,279
live through being stabbed

667
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:46,320
like to death or

668
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:50,319
having my identity stolen all my

669
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,319
money stolen or maybe

670
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,280
reputation destroyed like with lies or

671
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:56,639
something like that

672
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:58,319
that that's very interesting to think

673
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,520
about if you think about quality of life

674
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,439
and all those kinds of things

675
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,038
well one that's finite right

676
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,720
yeah and the other is kind of a long

677
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,879
prolonged almost torture

678
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,720
physical pain versus psychological pain

679
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,799
uh it's really interesting to

680
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,720
it's really interesting to think about

681
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:16,000
and i think another key piece to this um

682
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:17,839
which i don't have answers to

683
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,640
but but there is an element of emotion

684
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,480
and rage in the physical violence versus

685
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,480
again more of that clinical you know

686
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,919
information warfare and so

687
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:30,400
um it's really easy to show a

688
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,200
battlefield where there's death on both

689
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,640
sides and

690
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,440
bombs being dropped and buildings

691
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:37,520
destroyed it it fits very well into

692
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,919
propaganda for everyone involved

693
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,119
right regardless of what side they're on

694
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,440
when you start talking about

695
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:44,479
cyber warfare how many times have we

696
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,558
seen a big company

697
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,679
get data hacked or information hacked

698
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:49,279
and we all

699
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,798
you know read the headlines maybe throw

700
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:52,399
a tweet out and then move on with our

701
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,639
day and don't remember it anymore

702
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,440
and so it's just very very different i

703
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,360
think

704
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,880
in the emotion and response that it

705
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,319
invokes in people when they hear about

706
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,159
it as well

707
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,480
given the conflict do you think people

708
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,880
are fundamentally good

709
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,679
are we all sort of like blank slates

710
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,720
that could be

711
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,519
evil given the environment or good given

712
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,558
the environment

713
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:17,918
or can we kind of is there some base

714
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:20,399
that we can rely on that people

715
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,360
if left to their own devices will be

716
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,320
good

717
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,158
and trustworthy and honest i think you

718
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,359
have to separate out intention from

719
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,159
action

720
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,158
so if you talk to some of the most

721
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,799
heinous criminals in the world

722
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,880
they've rationalized their actions and

723
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:38,879
so you've got to ask yourself

724
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,400
what is the level of which they

725
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,559
understood what they were doing

726
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
that they intended to be malicious

727
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,519
nefarious

728
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,640
um and kind of do bad things versus

729
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:53,279
the actual actions themselves and so um

730
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,080
even as a society you know if let's say

731
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,440
for example

732
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,038
you were to walk down the street and you

733
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,720
were to murder somebody on the sidewalk

734
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:00,960
completely unprovoked

735
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,400
we would look at you and say you are a

736
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,640
you know a sociopath

737
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,080
uh you have everything wrong with you

738
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,600
and that is somebody that we do not want

739
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:08,319
in our society and therefore we will

740
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,959
levy

741
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:12,399
you know the extent of rule of law

742
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,079
against you in order to

743
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,320
protect society from you right you

744
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,158
become that a monster of that beast

745
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,839
if in the same situation somebody walks

746
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,960
in your house with a knife

747
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:24,959
and you murder them or you kill them

748
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,159
now we put you up on a pedestal as a

749
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,440
hero

750
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,080
and those are two very very different

751
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,720
responses they may be just as morbid

752
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,240
they may be just as violent uh in terms

753
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,079
of the actual actions

754
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,679
the intentions the way it's perceived is

755
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,079
very very different and so

756
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,159
i think that uh as a world we like a

757
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,480
very black and white clean-cut you know

758
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,400
good

759
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,240
bad uh i think the world's a lot more

760
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,759
messy than that and i think that

761
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,319
a lot of times when you look at

762
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,839
intention it's hard for us to tell what

763
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:54,558
somebody's intention is

764
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,519
but i've looked at a lot of you know

765
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,119
people who are both

766
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:58,960
considered very good and also a lot of

767
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:00,798
people are considered very bad

768
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:03,120
and they sound very similar in terms of

769
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:04,798
the motivations for their actions

770
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,479
and so i think that it's just a really

771
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:08,158
hard problem that probably doesn't have

772
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,240
a perfect solution or an answer

773
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,400
do you give much value to the intention

774
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,720
or do you think is is better to look

775
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,840
at the results of the behavior uh as

776
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,798
opposed to the

777
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,158
in the un underlying ideology the

778
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,359
underlying intention

779
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:24,799
of the behavior i think that intention

780
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:25,918
gets at the question of like are people

781
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,679
inherently good or bad

782
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,360
yeah right is i think that they're

783
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,759
generally inherently good

784
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:33,839
and the intention is driving towards the

785
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:35,759
thing that they believe is the best

786
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,240
outcome or the best thing for them to

787
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:40,798
pursue the action i think is where we

788
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,278
spend most of our time focused on

789
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:44,000
and frankly we actually may be a better

790
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,880
society

791
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,278
or kind of kinder as a humanity to each

792
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,480
other

793
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,720
if we spent more time looking at

794
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,278
intention rather than action um but

795
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,558
again

796
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,880
you know if somebody walks down the

797
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,720
street and murders somebody uh it's

798
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,320
really hard to have a conversation and

799
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,159
it may be inappropriate for us to have a

800
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:04,879
conversation about intention

801
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:08,000
versus uh any level of of action right

802
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:10,559
so you're one of the prominent

803
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,640
i would say even the faces of the the

804
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:15,359
world of cryptocurrency

805
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,840
bitcoin that whole entire world let's

806
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,240
dive straight in and ask uh

807
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,359
do you think do you consider yourself a

808
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,640
bitcoin

809
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,519
maximalist i think that the way i really

810
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,559
look at it is

811
00:25:25,519 --> 00:25:31,038
uh i work backwards off of what is the

812
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,158
maximalism that i believe in and the

813
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:36,079
world that i believe in

814
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,720
is kind of an automated world that is

815
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,759
run on these open decentralized

816
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,880
protocols

817
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,679
uh and what we ultimately do is we

818
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,480
return

819
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,559
sovereignty and individualism and and

820
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,440
kind of uh personal responsibility and

821
00:25:48,558 --> 00:25:52,240
liberty

822
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,278
uh to people over institutions and what

823
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,240
we end up doing

824
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:57,679
is we end up uh kind of taking what has

825
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,480
historically been a very

826
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:00,880
uh analog or physical world economy and

827
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,679
uh

828
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,559
geographic rule and we then kind of put

829
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,480
it in the cloud

830
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:08,240
and this digital economy becomes the

831
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,759
prevalent way that we all

832
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,480
uh conduct commerce communicate uh etc

833
00:26:11,759 --> 00:26:14,558
and so

834
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,839
it's less about any one single

835
00:26:14,558 --> 00:26:17,278
technology to me right

836
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,079
i think that it's pretty stupid for

837
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:24,640
people to um almost in a way

838
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:27,119
uh put an inanimate object up for uh

839
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:29,038
you know some sort of obsession uh to me

840
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:29,918
it's much more about the ideals the

841
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:32,720
ethos

842
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,200
uh and the most rational uh and likely

843
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,200
path

844
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,558
to that kind of end result or that world

845
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,080
that i think you know is at this point

846
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,038
just a foregone conclusion so the

847
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,038
distinction there

848
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:44,240
and maybe if people don't know the

849
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:47,839
terminology maximalism is basically

850
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,679
saying i really think this is a good

851
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:52,000
idea

852
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,880
like uh you know if you prefer a certain

853
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,640
kind of diet

854
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,880
you could be a keto maximalist saying

855
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,880
like this is probably

856
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,960
maybe it's not a hundred percent but

857
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,240
probably the diet that's healthiest for

858
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,840
humans kind of thing

859
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,079
in the same sense bitcoin maximalism is

860
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:08,158
saying

861
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,918
you know of course we don't know there's

862
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,720
a lot of uncertainty but this particular

863
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,278
technology

864
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,640
seems to be the best representations of

865
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:17,200
some set of ideals

866
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,880
that defines progress in in the future

867
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,798
but you're drawing a distinction between

868
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,840
sort of uh

869
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,119
cult-like obsession about an object of

870
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:28,558
any kind whether it's

871
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:31,359
keto uh or uh bitcoin

872
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,839
and just sort of believing that a

873
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,599
technology is the best representation of

874
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:39,119
a particular set of ideals

875
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:42,639
and you believe that sort of uh

876
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:44,319
this moving into the cloud

877
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,720
both the distributed nature of it but

878
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:49,038
also just the digital nature of it

879
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,798
is something that's going to uh be a

880
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:52,558
positive step for humanity

881
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,240
yeah i would even take maximalism a step

882
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,639
further and it's not just the

883
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,599
kind of singular viewpoint of this is

884
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,000
the best

885
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:02,398
it's also an element of it's

886
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,720
anti-everything else right

887
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:06,879
so you know take keto for example uh the

888
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,159
keto diet is not only the best diet all

889
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,080
the other diets are bad

890
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:11,600
yeah right and so it's it's a very

891
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,599
binary view of the world

892
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,798
um i think that what's probably most

893
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,038
misunderstood about

894
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:17,839
uh let's take bitcoin uh as a specific

895
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:19,679
example

896
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:22,079
is that most of the people who are

897
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,600
labeled bitcoin maximalist

898
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,119
they would be open-minded if they

899
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:26,398
believed that something else came along

900
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,359
that was a superior

901
00:28:26,398 --> 00:28:30,639
technology or had a better kind of

902
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,439
probability of achieving

903
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,080
again that ultimate vision i think where

904
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,080
uh

905
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,079
there's this controversy and kind of

906
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,319
clashing of uh ideas

907
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:42,558
is that the bitcoin community believes

908
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:45,119
bitcoin is the best way to do that

909
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,879
and has very specific arguments as to

910
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:48,558
why the other things are not

911
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,080
right and so what ultimately ends up

912
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,158
happening which is very weird

913
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,599
in uh the investing world right it's

914
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,120
unlikely that you and i are going to sit

915
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:56,398
down you're like apple stock is the best

916
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,000
stock and there's no other stock that's

917
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,158
worth anything yeah right

918
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,119
and uh and then also it's very weird if

919
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,679
you said to me

920
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,319
um you know this stock is worth zero and

921
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,798
that's where

922
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,240
everything that i own i've put on a

923
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:09,759
short on one single company

924
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,278
right there's diversification there's

925
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,798
much more kind of probabilistic thinking

926
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,679
in finance in general

927
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,278
uh when it comes to this specific world

928
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,399
of cryptocurrency and kind of digital

929
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,839
assets if you will

930
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,278
uh is there's two main groups of people

931
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:26,240
who are trying to build two

932
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,000
very very different things at the onset

933
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,519
but when you unpack it and you start to

934
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,880
spend more time on it you guys they're

935
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,319
actually trying to accomplish the same

936
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,799
thing in two different ways

937
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,359
so bitcoin is seen i think as a digital

938
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:36,879
currency

939
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,240
right kind of the idea that this is

940
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,520
going to ascend to become the next

941
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,759
global reserve currency

942
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:43,200
it's a programmatic kind of transparent

943
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,679
um money

944
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,440
and uh it's essentially just 180 degrees

945
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,159
difference than the inflationary

946
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,759
you know non-transparent fiat currencies

947
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,600
that exist in the world

948
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,798
you then look at kind of everything else

949
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:56,480
right and you have a lot of smart

950
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:57,759
contract platforms and

951
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,200
various things that they're all going

952
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,119
after right ethereum with kind of the

953
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,319
world computer approach and you can kind

954
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:03,519
of go down the line with all their other

955
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:04,480
arguments it's what they're trying to

956
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:06,079
build

957
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,399
i think the big difference just comes

958
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:11,759
down to uh innovation

959
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,319
for security and when you simplistically

960
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:15,519
look at it

961
00:30:12,319 --> 00:30:16,798
via that lens you actually

962
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:18,240
understand where both people are coming

963
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:18,879
from when you say security start to

964
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,480
interrupt

965
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,399
do you mean financial security or do you

966
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,599
mean like literally the the the security

967
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,479
of the

968
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,398
of the particular cryptocurrency the the

969
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,440
technical security of a blockchain so

970
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:32,319
when you look at let's say

971
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:34,080
um bitcoin versus ethereum right bitcoin

972
00:30:32,319 --> 00:30:34,720
has decided and that community has

973
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:35,918
decided

974
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,240
security is the number one thing that

975
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,559
you have to optimize for so

976
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,200
decentralization

977
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:43,038
um over everything else in terms of

978
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,038
transaction speeds

979
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,158
cost anything that you could come up

980
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:47,599
with that is

981
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,039
something that would be important for a

982
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:50,558
currency the number one thing to

983
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,798
optimize for is security

984
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,839
and as we have seen uh with a lot of

985
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:55,679
technologies right

986
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,199
facebook's libra or now what's known as

987
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:00,240
dm is a great example

988
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,440
uh not having decentralization is

989
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,558
susceptible to

990
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,278
the nation state and so a lot of these

991
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:07,918
other

992
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:08,720
platforms and blockchains uh they say

993
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,240
security is

994
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,600
important but it's not the most

995
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,720
important thing right we believe there's

996
00:31:11,599 --> 00:31:14,798
a trade-off between

997
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,159
you know a little less security and

998
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:18,798
transaction speed or

999
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,640
composability or whatever it is and so

1000
00:31:18,798 --> 00:31:23,359
take ethereum as kind of the

1001
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,440
second uh largest uh community in

1002
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:27,359
blockchain by market cap

1003
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,558
it was created because somebody wanted

1004
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:29,759
to or a group of people wanted to do

1005
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:30,879
something on bitcoin they felt like they

1006
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,079
couldn't do it and so they said hey

1007
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,440
we're going to go create something that

1008
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:34,879
has these smart contracts that we can

1009
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,480
then go do here

1010
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,640
again this is technology right so the

1011
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,038
tribalism of like you're right you're

1012
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,720
wrong

1013
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:42,079
to me is a little childish just in the

1014
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,919
sense of like the market is going to

1015
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,439
decide what is most valuable

1016
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,799
and then when you go inside of that

1017
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,000
community like there's a lot of dumb

1018
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:48,720
ideas people are trying to build around

1019
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
bitcoin

1020
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,440
there's also a lot of really really

1021
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,480
great ideas that people trying to build

1022
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,720
around bitcoin

1023
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,240
same thing in the ethereum world and so

1024
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,839
what you end up getting i think is the

1025
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,440
tribalism really comes out of the idea

1026
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:01,839
that there's a ticker price

1027
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:05,278
that is attached to all of this right if

1028
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:07,278
you go back in history of technology

1029
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:08,960
venture capitalists didn't sit around

1030
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,200
the table and yell and scream at each

1031
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,200
other in this like religious zealot way

1032
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,960
right because you bet on one type of

1033
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,759
cloud computing platform and i bet on

1034
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
another one

1035
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:18,240
right it's just the market's going to

1036
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,919
decide we're both going to work on and

1037
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,240
try to make ours successful

1038
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,440
uh here i think that the sensitivity and

1039
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,159
mainly comes out of the bitcoin

1040
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,558
community

1041
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:27,600
is that a lot of this is being funded

1042
00:32:26,558 --> 00:32:28,798
not only by

1043
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,038
venture capitalists and kind of

1044
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:31,918
professional money managers and asset

1045
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:33,599
allocators

1046
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,960
there's also this element of including

1047
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,199
the retail investor

1048
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,360
and the public and so it whether it's

1049
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,960
through icos or some other forms of

1050
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,278
capital raising

1051
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,640
there's arguments for it saying hey look

1052
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:46,558
uh this now gives

1053
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,399
kind of the little guy some sort of

1054
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,000
access and ability to do it

1055
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:51,439
but there's also arguments against it

1056
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,119
some people say hey it's easier to dupe

1057
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,720
them and it's easier to run scams and

1058
00:32:53,119 --> 00:32:56,879
kind of all this stuff and so

1059
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,839
ultimately i think that uh crypto is

1060
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,080
this like

1061
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:01,119
arena of ideas it is literally the war

1062
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:03,759
of attrition

1063
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:05,439
and uh what will end up happening is ten

1064
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,278
years from now you and i will talk

1065
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,360
and we're gonna say well the market said

1066
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:11,919
x was valuable and y wasn't

1067
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,278
and so all of the tribalism from between

1068
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,278
you know here and there

1069
00:33:13,278 --> 00:33:16,558
uh it's fun it's you know engaging

1070
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:16,960
whatever but also it doesn't really

1071
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:18,480
matter

1072
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,640
yeah because the public is involved

1073
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,480
there's a lot of personalities and so

1074
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,159
a lot of times we focus on the ex

1075
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,720
extreme personalities

1076
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,480
that do a lot of maybe uh pardon the

1077
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:30,319
french [ __ ] talking and

1078
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,000
and so we kind of focus on that but

1079
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:32,398
that's not necessarily representative of

1080
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,079
the

1081
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:35,839
communities involved let's talk about

1082
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,599
bitcoin first and then it'll help us use

1083
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,678
as a kind of comparison to

1084
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,199
ethereum or whatever else so when you

1085
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:42,320
think about what is money

1086
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,440
right that's kind of the first question

1087
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,720
people really kind of go down the rabbit

1088
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,278
hole on and

1089
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,798
ultimately today it's a belief system

1090
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:50,558
right and you may believe that one

1091
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:51,599
currency has more value over another

1092
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,398
because it's backed by a certain

1093
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:56,480
military or a certain government has

1094
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:57,599
a monetary policy that you believe in or

1095
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,038
don't believe in

1096
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:01,038
but ultimately it's a belief system that

1097
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:03,038
there's nothing backing this

1098
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:04,240
other than a government asks you to pay

1099
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,240
your taxes in it right

1100
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,599
and they can have a monopoly on violence

1101
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,719
uh in terms they can put you in jail if

1102
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,398
you don't pay your taxes

1103
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,598
uh they can go to other countries and

1104
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:16,319
they can invade and do all this stuff

1105
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,119
it wasn't always like that right it was

1106
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,679
historically

1107
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,159
a layer one technology was gold and so

1108
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,960
gold

1109
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,559
was a fantastic store of value you knew

1110
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,079
that if you held gold it wasn't going to

1111
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:27,679
be inflated away it was sound money it

1112
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,960
was outside the system and no one could

1113
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,559
create more of it

1114
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,639
the reason why that's important is

1115
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,559
because that optimization for store of

1116
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,000
value served as the bedrock

1117
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:40,960
of the entire stack of uh money

1118
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,480
uh for 5000 years and so the problem

1119
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,358
with that though again trade-off between

1120
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,039
store of value

1121
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:46,398
is it was really hard to transact with

1122
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:48,079
right if i came in here

1123
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:49,598
and i and you said hey i want a couple

1124
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,480
of ounces of gold and i had a whole bar

1125
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,879
i'd have to literally

1126
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,039
shave off the ounces of gold uh it's

1127
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,199
heavy to carry around if you said to me

1128
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:58,480
hey you're in one city mail it to me

1129
00:34:57,199 --> 00:34:59,679
it's really expensive you know there's

1130
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,519
all these issues with it

1131
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,358
and so ultimately what people said was

1132
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:05,039
well let's create a second layer

1133
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,039
on top of that gold in order to make it

1134
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:08,800
easier to transact and so we created

1135
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:09,838
paper claims on the gold so hey don't

1136
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,400
carry around the gold in your pocket

1137
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,000
anymore

1138
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,838
put it in a vault or a bank they're

1139
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,199
going to issue a paper claim

1140
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:16,799
now you and i can trade these paper

1141
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,078
claims around and at any point if you

1142
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,519
want the gold you just show up and you

1143
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,440
say hey give me you know three ounces of

1144
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:23,759
gold or two bars or whatever

1145
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,800
and so that actually made the store a

1146
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,320
value it was

1147
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,920
allowed that to be the anchor and kind

1148
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,240
of the most important part the security

1149
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,079
of

1150
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:31,439
your purchasing power but now it became

1151
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,960
easier to transact and then eventually

1152
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,639
we built layers even on top of that so

1153
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,320
everything from electronic money

1154
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,000
uh kind of electronic q-sips all the way

1155
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,960
to credit and other systems on top of

1156
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,599
that gold

1157
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,240
1971 comes around and obviously we d-peg

1158
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,000
from that

1159
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:45,439
gold right it was a temporary measure at

1160
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,838
the time we ended up not going back to

1161
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,760
it

1162
00:35:45,838 --> 00:35:49,279
and so what you moved uh or transitioned

1163
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,040
from was sound money which was outside

1164
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,560
the system no one could create more

1165
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,920
to now the government had full control

1166
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:54,480
they could create as much as they wanted

1167
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,599
to

1168
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,358
they tried to be responsible and

1169
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,559
disciplined but obviously hard to do

1170
00:35:57,358 --> 00:35:59,920
sometimes we've been really good at it

1171
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,039
sometimes we've been less good at it and

1172
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,559
you go around the world and

1173
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,159
some countries have absolutely sucked at

1174
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:06,400
it and some have been good at it

1175
00:36:04,159 --> 00:36:08,159
and so when you look into the bitcoin

1176
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,240
world i think that when you look at the

1177
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,598
optimization for security similar to

1178
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,679
gold store value

1179
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,599
people hold it purchasing power has gone

1180
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,159
up a lot year over year it's like a 200

1181
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,320
percent

1182
00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:19,519
year-over-year compounded annual growth

1183
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,280
uh for over a decade

1184
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:23,280
right so you measure this in kind of the

1185
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,720
us dollar exchange price et cetera

1186
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,119
but there's still a lot of people who

1187
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:28,959
will yell and scream about it's slow

1188
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,240
it's costly right all the things around

1189
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,199
those transactions

1190
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:34,799
that are obstacles or challenges and so

1191
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:36,000
there's basically two schools of thought

1192
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,200
and this is where we kind of get into

1193
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,960
the bifurcation

1194
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,118
some people just said hey this

1195
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,320
technology is antiquated we can't use it

1196
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,838
it doesn't make sense

1197
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,519
uh and so what we're gonna do is we're

1198
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,880
gonna go build something new and so you

1199
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:48,639
go get you know kind of all of the

1200
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,880
various versions there

1201
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:52,719
the bitcoin community says no just like

1202
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,240
gold had paper claims and other things

1203
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,799
built on top and layer two three four

1204
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:56,399
five

1205
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,440
we're gonna do that here and so they've

1206
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,160
already started to build kind of this

1207
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,000
layer two

1208
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:02,239
where it's easier to transact it's

1209
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,280
cheaper it's faster etc

1210
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,879
and so i actually think that both of

1211
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,599
those worlds are gonna coexist in the

1212
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,519
future

1213
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,800
the big question is just which one has

1214
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,199
more importance

1215
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,880
right so again get out of binary it's

1216
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,598
just probabilistically

1217
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,800
and so my personal belief is that the

1218
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:21,200
security the the

1219
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,039
store of value component as the bedrock

1220
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,598
for a monetary system

1221
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,599
is essential right like that is the most

1222
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,680
important thing because you can always

1223
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,599
improve the other components but you

1224
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:32,719
can't go back and fix that kind of core

1225
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,000
piece

1226
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,078
so if money money is a an idea that we

1227
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,280
all it's like an emergent idea that we

1228
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:41,359
believe in

1229
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:43,359
you're saying that security is one of

1230
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:46,480
the most fundamental catalysts

1231
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:47,358
or fuels for that idea to sort of take

1232
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,320
hold

1233
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:51,358
and be stable and sort of take over the

1234
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,680
world

1235
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:55,199
the other stuff is really nice to have

1236
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,480
but if you don't have the security

1237
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:58,559
you're not going to

1238
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,159
like it's not going to spread in a viral

1239
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:02,960
sense in in our

1240
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:03,598
human brains well and especially in

1241
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,519
light of

1242
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,200
the kind of the macro economy right so

1243
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:08,400
like what's so fascinating about the

1244
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,000
last 12 months

1245
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,440
is um in investing in general the best

1246
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,440
returns right i kind of put that in air

1247
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,240
quotes a little bit is something that is

1248
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,200
different

1249
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,639
than everything else and right so being

1250
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:21,118
different and wrong just means you're an

1251
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:22,960
idiot

1252
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:24,400
right being different and right means

1253
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,519
that that's where kind of the outsized

1254
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,039
returns are

1255
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:29,119
and so if you look around the world at

1256
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,039
currencies today they're all the same

1257
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:32,880
they're all inflationary unlimited

1258
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,880
supply controlled by a government

1259
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,800
done and decisions made in a very

1260
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,079
non-transparent process

1261
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,599
and what we've watched is the

1262
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,519
manipulation of all of those currencies

1263
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,920
over the last 12 months

1264
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,639
in direct contrast to that is this thing

1265
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,039
bitcoin

1266
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:48,159
which is outside of the system has a

1267
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,679
finite supply

1268
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,000
transparent and programmatic monetary

1269
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:52,719
policy and so when you see those two

1270
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,199
systems

1271
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:56,879
kind of um in comparison to each other

1272
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,759
in the united states

1273
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,760
there's a lot of people who say the

1274
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:01,599
dollar works great for me i can go to

1275
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,200
the atm i can get out physical cash

1276
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:06,320
if i want to swipe a card i could do

1277
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:07,358
that my money in my bank doesn't lose 50

1278
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,200
of its value in a day

1279
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,639
in terms of purchasing power like the

1280
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,319
dollar is pretty good

1281
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:14,719
when you go to other countries that

1282
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,559
might not be the case and so i do think

1283
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,078
that there's uh kind of a relative

1284
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:19,679
analysis that goes on here if you

1285
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,280
compare bitcoin to the dollar

1286
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,118
there's all kinds of arguments to make

1287
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,400
that the dollar is better as a medium of

1288
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,320
exchange today

1289
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,760
but if i go and i tell you what about in

1290
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,960
you know these kind of extreme

1291
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,000
examples of uh venezuela zimbabwe turkey

1292
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,760
et cetera

1293
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,440
and so i think that that's kind of one

1294
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,320
perspective to view this through

1295
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,720
is security versus all of the innovative

1296
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:42,320
components of a medium of exchange etc

1297
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,919
the second thing though that i think is

1298
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,359
really really important is around

1299
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,519
censorship

1300
00:39:45,358 --> 00:39:48,880
and so when you look at again every

1301
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,039
currency in the world today

1302
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,119
every single financial service they're

1303
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:55,199
highly susceptible to censorship

1304
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,400
and actually i would argue the united

1305
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,719
states is in the business

1306
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,000
of censorship in terms of you know how

1307
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,559
many countries around the world

1308
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,440
do we sanction and cut them off in

1309
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,400
either a

1310
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,440
minimal or a very material way from the

1311
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,200
global financial system

1312
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,400
so when you define when you talk about

1313
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:14,318
censorship do you mean just the

1314
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,440
censoring your ability to operate freely

1315
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:17,119
in the world

1316
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,920
well look at it a little bit differently

1317
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,519
which is that the united states has

1318
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,880
kind of the american superiority because

1319
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:23,679
we have the bombs the bullets the

1320
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,760
soldiers and

1321
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:28,559
and that military might we basically

1322
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:31,520
impose our will

1323
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,318
around the world and so uh there's a

1324
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:34,400
very strong

1325
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,759
argument to be made that there are

1326
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,680
certain countries around the world

1327
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,200
that are being sanctioned that the

1328
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:41,519
people of those countries

1329
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:43,279
did nothing wrong now the governments

1330
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:45,519
are bad right in terms of the way that

1331
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,640
you and i would look at democratic rule

1332
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:50,800
or communism or whatever it is

1333
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:52,078
but the people are being hurt as well so

1334
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,440
there's a whole group of people who

1335
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,760
would have just argued listen

1336
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,720
we shouldn't hurt anyone at the expense

1337
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:59,040
of punishing

1338
00:40:56,719 --> 00:41:00,399
one person or a group of people there's

1339
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,400
other people who argue against that

1340
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,400
but i do think that if you really kind

1341
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,960
of zoom out and you say i'm going to

1342
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,280
take myself

1343
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,559
out of the western world view and i'm

1344
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,560
simply going to look at this as we're

1345
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:12,880
all part of the human race

1346
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,078
it's censorship and there might be an

1347
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,358
argument for censorship

1348
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,280
but there also might be an argument

1349
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:18,000
against the censorship and so what

1350
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,119
bitcoin

1351
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,719
does as that specific kind of payment

1352
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,000
network is it says anyone in the world

1353
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:25,759
with an internet connection

1354
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,599
i don't care where you are born what

1355
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,160
language you speak what religion you are

1356
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,359
your wealth status your education status

1357
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,279
none of it matters

1358
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:35,358
if you have an internet connection you

1359
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:37,280
can plug into this monetary system

1360
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:39,199
and you can move value around the world

1361
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,560
to anyone else without asking for

1362
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,279
permission

1363
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:45,119
and in the united states we basically

1364
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,319
have that ability in the us dollar kind

1365
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,519
of traditional banking system

1366
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:48,719
i can pretty much send money to almost

1367
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,079
anyone i want unless they're a really

1368
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:51,519
bad person that's on some list or

1369
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,880
something

1370
00:41:51,519 --> 00:41:54,719
most people in the world don't have that

1371
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,680
capability and so what you're

1372
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:57,838
essentially doing is you're

1373
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:01,358
democratizing access

1374
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:04,480
to a true store value and

1375
00:42:01,358 --> 00:42:06,559
a medium of exchange right and so what

1376
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,039
you see in many of these countries is

1377
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,920
that when their currency starts to fail

1378
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,759
the first thing that a government or a

1379
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,318
group of people in power and influence

1380
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,920
do

1381
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:18,800
is they lock the citizens into the

1382
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,358
currency with capital controls

1383
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,359
why because if you let them out it

1384
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:26,159
exasperates the problem

1385
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,440
and so now what we're seeing is we

1386
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,598
basically are giving

1387
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:32,000
a tool to billions of people around the

1388
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:35,280
world that is a peaceful protest

1389
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,358
right you and i had no say at all

1390
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,400
when not only the federal reserve and

1391
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:38,880
elected officials here in the united

1392
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,318
states

1393
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,400
but central banks around the world over

1394
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:44,239
the last 12 months decided to create

1395
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,440
trillions of dollars and inject it into

1396
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:47,039
the monetary system

1397
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,400
right they have arguments and some of

1398
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:49,358
them are very good arguments as to why

1399
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,800
they should do that they're trying to

1400
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,000
mitigate short-term pain

1401
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,800
long-term they'll figure out the other

1402
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,599
issues right they have very kind of um

1403
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,359
elaborate and well-articulated um kind

1404
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,079
of viewpoint as to why they're doing it

1405
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,279
but you and i had no say and so when you

1406
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,800
start to look at

1407
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,119
we have a very small group of people in

1408
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:08,079
this world uh both in our country and in

1409
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:10,318
countries around the world

1410
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,039
that make these decisions that have very

1411
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:15,599
very far-reaching kind of impact

1412
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:16,400
and on top of that in many cases there's

1413
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,119
actually not

1414
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,079
that much kind of accountability because

1415
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:21,358
usually these are not

1416
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,680
elected officials who are making some of

1417
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,039
these decisions these are appointed

1418
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:26,879
you can argue that hey we elected

1419
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:27,838
somebody who appointed them but at the

1420
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,318
same time

1421
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,759
that accountability isn't quite there

1422
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:33,199
and so i think ultimately when you just

1423
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,480
back out you say you know what is

1424
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:35,598
bitcoin and why is it important to the

1425
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,920
world

1426
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:39,519
it is giving access to anyone in the

1427
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,400
world with an internet connection to a

1428
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:42,559
store of value

1429
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,400
and a monetary network that allows them

1430
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:47,440
to peacefully protest and to

1431
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:49,920
opt out of a system that

1432
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:51,200
pretty much is not working for majority

1433
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,880
of people in the world

1434
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:55,118
so it's moving the power from these

1435
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:59,838
centralized places sometimes unelected

1436
00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:02,640
to the individuals and to the people

1437
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:03,519
so the dollar does seem to work for for

1438
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,719
americans

1439
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,000
and for many people in the world but you

1440
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:09,919
kind of have a vision you

1441
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,199
you paint a picture of a future where

1442
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,599
potentially we move to cryptocurrency so

1443
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:18,159
what kind of trajectory do you see where

1444
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,000
bitcoin can become the main currency

1445
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,279
in the world or at least cryptocurrency

1446
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,679
become the main

1447
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,519
way of storing value in the world and

1448
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,399
basically overtake the dollar

1449
00:44:25,519 --> 00:44:29,039
yeah so i always go first to we don't

1450
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,039
need to have

1451
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,279
competition like in terms of like a

1452
00:44:31,039 --> 00:44:36,159
direct competition between the dollar

1453
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,680
and bitcoin right if you look at most

1454
00:44:36,159 --> 00:44:39,358
technologies in the world

1455
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:41,279
uh the really valuable ones are actually

1456
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:43,598
market expanding technologies

1457
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,040
rather than simply just market share

1458
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,039
stealing technologies

1459
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,559
right so if you look at uber for example

1460
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,719
uber didn't just say hey i'm going to go

1461
00:44:48,559 --> 00:44:52,480
take out all the taxis right it actually

1462
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,919
drastically expanded the market for

1463
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,318
people now there's literally millions of

1464
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,519
people

1465
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:57,599
in the united states who don't have cars

1466
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,280
because they use uber right and so i

1467
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,160
think that bitcoin is very similar

1468
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,280
in that yes there is a component of

1469
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:05,759
medium of exchange

1470
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,359
uh in terms of the dollar but also there

1471
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,720
is this component of just store value

1472
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:10,719
assets in general

1473
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,239
and so when you start to look at bitcoin

1474
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:14,239
specifically i think that what you're

1475
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:14,799
seeing is you're seeing a generational

1476
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:16,879
gap

1477
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,800
where young people say i grew up with a

1478
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,800
phone in my hand i'm digitally native

1479
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,160
the whole idea of going to the bank and

1480
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:23,920
sending a wire

1481
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:26,399
or going to an atm and getting physical

1482
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,920
cash is an antiquated idea in their mind

1483
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,838
right i one time asked my brother he's

1484
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:31,599
24 years old and i said hey how do you

1485
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:32,960
send money to your friends

1486
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,880
and he gave me one answer which i

1487
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,199
expected which was venmo and the second

1488
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,800
answer i didn't expect he said uber

1489
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:40,159
i said how do you send money via uber he

1490
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:42,480
said well we get in a car together and

1491
00:45:40,159 --> 00:45:44,078
at the end we split the ride

1492
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:46,079
and so again you and i have probably

1493
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,599
both done that but i never thought of it

1494
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:48,960
as a way to send money to each other and

1495
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,440
so it is a

1496
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,318
psychological difference between even me

1497
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:55,358
who's only you know

1498
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:57,119
a decade older than him or so uh and his

1499
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:58,559
peer group and so i think as we're

1500
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:00,960
watching kind of bitcoin

1501
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:01,679
continue this ascent ultimately what

1502
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,679
we're seeing

1503
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:05,519
is an entire generation of kids are

1504
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:08,078
saying listen if i look at

1505
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,599
financial assets across the board i have

1506
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,039
stocks i have bonds i have currencies

1507
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,079
and i have commodities

1508
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:15,599
i know that bonds from a real rate

1509
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,359
return perspective

1510
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,960
is flat to negative right i'm going to

1511
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,519
make no money on this because

1512
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,480
i have a belief that my dollar is being

1513
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:24,159
devalued

1514
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,719
and actually what we're starting to see

1515
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,318
is again the internet has broken down

1516
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:31,039
these walled gardens and kind of these

1517
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:32,719
centralized uh hubs of information

1518
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:35,838
in that if you were to look at let's say

1519
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:38,159
the stock market from 1971 to today

1520
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,519
in dollar terms it's a 45 degree angle

1521
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:40,159
right up into the right right you know

1522
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:42,800
it's kind of seven

1523
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:44,159
eight ten percent growth uh every year

1524
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,280
and it's amazing just get invested in

1525
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:46,559
the stock market and you'll make money

1526
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,400
over a long period of time regardless of

1527
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:50,078
the dips along the way

1528
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,480
if you denominate that same stock market

1529
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:54,480
in gold the stock market is down since

1530
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,079
1971.

1531
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,838
and so is it so much that the stock

1532
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,599
market is accruing true value

1533
00:46:57,838 --> 00:47:01,199
or is it that the underlying currency in

1534
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:03,599
which it is denominated in

1535
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,799
is being devalued right and i was being

1536
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,640
devalued in a

1537
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,839
very disciplined way right in terms of

1538
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:09,838
it's not like it went 50

1539
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,440
devaluation uh in a short period of time

1540
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:13,119
but still being devalued

1541
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:15,280
and so i think that people are waking up

1542
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:16,720
to this idea that a traditional 60 40

1543
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:19,599
type global portfolio

1544
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:20,558
doesn't work anymore right 40 of it in

1545
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,960
bonds

1546
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:23,599
is just not going to get it done and so

1547
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,280
when you

1548
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,880
start to look at this people first look

1549
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,960
at bitcoin via

1550
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,160
two main ways in my opinion they look at

1551
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,838
it one as a store value

1552
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:33,199
should i actually go and put some of my

1553
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:34,000
wealth there use it as a savings

1554
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:36,078
technology

1555
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,119
right we ask people in the traditional

1556
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,200
world if you're a teacher

1557
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,800
a fireman an accounting you know

1558
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,719
mid-level manager

1559
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,800
we say hey go do your job be best in

1560
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:45,919
class as a fireman or as a teacher

1561
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,519
and then oh by the way you'd be a

1562
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,960
professional investor as well because if

1563
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:49,440
you just put your dollars in your bank

1564
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,800
account

1565
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:53,200
you're literally going to have your

1566
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,240
wealth devalued away over time so you

1567
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:58,159
can't just save you have to invest

1568
00:47:56,239 --> 00:47:59,358
that is a really tall task for people

1569
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:00,318
they have a hard enough time just doing

1570
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:02,000
their job right

1571
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:03,358
taking care of their family right now

1572
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,880
they got to go be an investor

1573
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:06,639
so i think savings technology for a

1574
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:10,000
bitcoin standpoint is if you

1575
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,480
buy satoshi's or bitcoin over time it

1576
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,000
will

1577
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,039
uh increase from a purchasing power

1578
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:15,280
standpoint because there's a fixed

1579
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:17,519
supply and demand continues to rise

1580
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,960
but then you start to look at well what

1581
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:21,280
other assets do people put in their

1582
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,838
portfolios whether it's art

1583
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:25,040
it's real estate it's precious metals or

1584
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:26,880
something else

1585
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:28,239
most of those assets are not because

1586
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,318
people actually think that they're going

1587
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,639
to go up in value over time

1588
00:48:30,318 --> 00:48:34,000
they're using a store of value right the

1589
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:35,598
reason why somebody buys gold

1590
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,400
is because it's a store of value right

1591
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:40,960
historically that's a narrative driven

1592
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,880
uh type asset though right we tell

1593
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,480
people it's scarce we tell people that

1594
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:46,160
it is a store of value

1595
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:47,599
when you look at it though we don't know

1596
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:48,078
how much gold exists in the world we

1597
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:49,519
have a good

1598
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,519
estimate right but we don't actually we

1599
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:52,719
can't prove how much there is

1600
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,719
we don't know how much is coming out of

1601
00:48:52,719 --> 00:48:57,439
the ground every day again great

1602
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,639
fantastic estimate but we can't prove it

1603
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,679
and we don't know what the total supply

1604
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:01,279
and that's what you mean by narrative

1605
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,078
driven we can't really prove it like

1606
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,000
mathematically

1607
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:05,920
we you i and everyone else in the world

1608
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,159
has lived in a narrative driven world

1609
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:09,039
for the last couple of decades right and

1610
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:11,039
what the internet

1611
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,960
and digital technologies have done is it

1612
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:16,000
opened up the possibility

1613
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:18,960
and the desire from people to have a

1614
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,760
world now where i can validate things so

1615
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,960
when i see

1616
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:24,480
that headline i want to see you

1617
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,000
say whatever happened to the news if

1618
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:27,199
you're the subject of the news rather

1619
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,000
than have somebody else tell me the

1620
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:29,679
story

1621
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,519
if i see that you say something is

1622
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:33,838
scarce prove to me

1623
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:35,358
that it is scarce and so i think that's

1624
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:36,639
kind of a psychological shift the

1625
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:37,519
younger generation is starting to

1626
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,440
understand because

1627
00:49:37,519 --> 00:49:40,639
ultimately you and i probably grew up in

1628
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:41,119
a world where parents could tell us the

1629
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:43,118
story

1630
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,039
and we just believed it you know dad or

1631
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:46,800
mom says it it must be true

1632
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:48,880
if my brother heard a story what does he

1633
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,079
do he goes to google and he looks it up

1634
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,519
randy comes back and usually tells my

1635
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,000
parents how you got the story wrong

1636
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:53,358
right

1637
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:55,679
and so i think that that that

1638
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:57,199
provability or that that validation

1639
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:58,639
ends up becoming really really important

1640
00:49:57,199 --> 00:50:00,000
and so you know look at something like

1641
00:49:58,639 --> 00:50:01,838
gold i think that

1642
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,920
people are drastically underestimating

1643
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:07,920
the shift that's underway right now

1644
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:11,440
gold is won down in value since april

1645
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:13,838
or i'm sorry august of 2020. and so in a

1646
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,519
time frame where central banks have had

1647
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:16,960
historic quantitative easing literally

1648
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:17,679
six trillion dollars in the united

1649
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,519
states

1650
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,598
the one asset that historically has been

1651
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:23,280
the best store of value and has uh you

1652
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,119
know in 2008 financial crisis

1653
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,400
hit an all-time high based on the the

1654
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:30,079
government response

1655
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,720
has actually suffered uh for a main part

1656
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,039
of this

1657
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,399
financial crisis you then look at

1658
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:34,719
central banks around the world who have

1659
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,400
been

1660
00:50:34,719 --> 00:50:39,039
very large holders of gold for a long

1661
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,599
time and net buyers on a monthly basis

1662
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,639
for multiple months over the last six

1663
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,359
months they've been net

1664
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,920
sellers of gold and then you start to

1665
00:50:45,358 --> 00:50:47,598
look at

1666
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,000
jewelry demand so the actual

1667
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,960
non-monetary value of gold

1668
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,000
and that demand for gold jewelry peaked

1669
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,880
in 2013

1670
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,000
and has continued to fall since and so

1671
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,400
what you start to say to yourself is

1672
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,079
take

1673
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:02,000
just the asset of gold which about 10

1674
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:03,760
trillion dollars market cap

1675
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,119
and you say okay well if jewelry demand

1676
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:07,440
continues to fall even if it's at a

1677
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,358
slight rate but it continues to contract

1678
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,358
you have central banks that now at some

1679
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,358
times are net sellers and sometimes net

1680
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:14,000
buyers right so okay again contraction

1681
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:16,318
there

1682
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,039
and then from the investment standpoint

1683
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:19,119
the actual

1684
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:20,880
price that the daily price of this

1685
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:22,559
continues to fall which is

1686
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,800
a signal that there's a contracting

1687
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,680
demand from an investment perspective

1688
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:28,880
that's 93 percent of all use of gold

1689
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:30,639
only seven percent of it's used for

1690
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,000
actual technology and metal conduction

1691
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:33,358
and things like that

1692
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:36,239
and so you have a 10 trillion dollar

1693
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:37,920
asset that it appears and again maybe

1694
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:38,879
data changes and i'll change my mind and

1695
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,680
other people change their mind but it

1696
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,519
appears

1697
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,879
is on the decline and so if that happens

1698
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:44,559
you're going to get the contraction of a

1699
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,800
10 trillion dollar asset

1700
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,000
where's all that value go and what

1701
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,760
you're seeing is at the same time that

1702
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:53,199
that asset is contracting

1703
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:55,839
you're also seeing a massive influx

1704
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:56,558
from not only retail investors not only

1705
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:58,558
uh kind of

1706
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:59,760
the wealthy and the elite but also from

1707
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,960
financial institutions

1708
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,800
corporations pension funds etc into this

1709
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,400
kind of digital sound money so you're

1710
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,200
saying that there's a kind of shift

1711
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,720
from gold to bitcoin because they have a

1712
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:13,199
lot of the same properties except

1713
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:15,199
one is in the physical space the other

1714
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,838
in the digital space so do you see like

1715
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:19,519
central

1716
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:20,880
banks uh quietly potentially switching

1717
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,159
out

1718
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:27,280
uh from sort of ghost gold to bitcoin

1719
00:52:24,159 --> 00:52:27,679
like naturally it's just doing is seeing

1720
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,599
the

1721
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:31,440
pattern that you're referring to now but

1722
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,640
more drastically into the future where

1723
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,559
there's a complete shift

1724
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:36,558
if you line up the gold community and

1725
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:38,160
the bitcoin community next to each other

1726
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,839
they'll agree on all the problems that

1727
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:41,920
they that they see in the world

1728
00:52:39,838 --> 00:52:43,440
right they'll actually agree on the

1729
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:44,720
solution that sound money is the

1730
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,280
solution

1731
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,000
were they differentiate is the gold

1732
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,519
communities

1733
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,199
believes that it's the analog

1734
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:52,159
application of sound money right the

1735
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,000
physical gold

1736
00:52:52,159 --> 00:52:55,279
that is the solution the bitcoin

1737
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,880
community believes the digital

1738
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,559
application of sound money bitcoin

1739
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,920
can you find sound money by the way

1740
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:01,599
someone is just outside the system and

1741
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,318
no one can create more of it so nobody

1742
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,640
controls it

1743
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:07,039
this scarcity is fundamental exactly why

1744
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:09,598
scarcity important in money

1745
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:11,519
i think scarcity just has this very high

1746
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:12,318
correlation to value across all assets

1747
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:14,079
not just money

1748
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:15,759
right money happens to be the the unit

1749
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:19,359
of account that we use in terms of

1750
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:21,280
uh daily commerce um but whether it is

1751
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:22,400
um you know as we're seeing how uh

1752
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,720
sneakers are

1753
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,880
you know what whatever it is uh scarcity

1754
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,318
ultimately is that signal of value i

1755
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,039
think and that's just

1756
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:32,318
been the way that humans uh derive value

1757
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:34,000
for literally you know thousands and

1758
00:53:32,318 --> 00:53:36,079
thousands of years yeah i gotta say

1759
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,960
that's my view on life and love in

1760
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,839
general is scarcity is what makes it

1761
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,000
more valuable people talk about

1762
00:53:40,838 --> 00:53:44,239
immortality

1763
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:45,280
i you know i would like to be immortal

1764
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:48,318
but it does

1765
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:52,800
it does seem that uh when you let go

1766
00:53:48,318 --> 00:53:57,519
of the fightiness of life i feel like

1767
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:59,839
that meals and the experiences you have

1768
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,280
get devalued significantly like the

1769
00:53:59,838 --> 00:54:04,400
longer you live

1770
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,839
the less value there are in in infinity

1771
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,400
if you live forever

1772
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:10,078
i worry that all the meaning will will

1773
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,079
dissipate and the same thing with love

1774
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,839
a quick criticism of sort of dating

1775
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:16,480
culture and all that kind of stuff

1776
00:54:13,838 --> 00:54:18,000
like i haven't uh had shocking

1777
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:20,000
revelation that i've never been an

1778
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,280
attended date or any of those things

1779
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:26,719
i i believe that scarcity and dating and

1780
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,359
interaction is like intensifies the

1781
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:29,759
value of

1782
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:31,920
when the interactions do happen so we'll

1783
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:34,240
need like when love does happen

1784
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,318
and so in that sense there's something

1785
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,078
magical about scarcity in the more

1786
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:40,719
subjective psychological social

1787
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:42,318
world as well and perhaps money is just

1788
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:44,558
another version of that right it's just

1789
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:45,519
it's all about the stories and ideas we

1790
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,559
tell ourselves

1791
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:48,318
i think they're actually more

1792
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,000
interconnected than you're giving it

1793
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:53,599
credit for right which is

1794
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:56,880
what is money money is time ultimately

1795
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:59,838
right the the pursuit of

1796
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:02,318
the acquisition of money right of

1797
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:04,639
whether it's a currency or true money

1798
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:05,599
is because that should give you more

1799
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:07,920
time

1800
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,880
and so one of my favorite movies ever is

1801
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,798
uh and it's

1802
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,599
funny because justin timberlake is in it

1803
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:15,838
uh is this movie

1804
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:16,640
i lose most people at that point in time

1805
00:55:15,838 --> 00:55:18,078
in time

1806
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,159
and basically the premise of the movie

1807
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:21,760
is that everyone has a clock that's

1808
00:55:20,159 --> 00:55:24,558
embedded into their arm

1809
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,280
and so uh if you go to work you

1810
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:26,960
basically

1811
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,720
put your arm underneath when you leave

1812
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,720
and there's time that's deposited into

1813
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:33,519
your clock and if your clock ever hits

1814
00:55:30,719 --> 00:55:34,318
all zeros you're dead you die on the

1815
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:36,079
spot

1816
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:37,599
and so there's a number of scenes where

1817
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,960
people are basically running

1818
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,240
you know to get to you and i give you a

1819
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,000
little bit more time so that you can get

1820
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,919
to work on monday and then you

1821
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,760
work to acquire time and so basically

1822
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,599
time becomes this currency

1823
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,480
but what becomes very fascinating about

1824
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:52,720
it is there are sections in society

1825
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,639
where literally there's physical places

1826
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,879
if you only have let's say

1827
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:58,159
72 hours or less you're allowed to go to

1828
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:59,920
section 1.

1829
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:01,279
section 5 though is because you have

1830
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:04,000
years and years and years

1831
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,680
on your clock and in this movie everyone

1832
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:08,639
at the age of 25

1833
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,598
freezes from a biological aging

1834
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:11,279
standpoint

1835
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,760
so everyone stays the same but you may

1836
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,680
have lived for a thousand years

1837
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,200
and so what becomes so fascinating about

1838
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:19,679
it is that

1839
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:20,719
rich people have time poor people do not

1840
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,960
have time

1841
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:24,159
and so in it justin timberlake the main

1842
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,960
character at one point

1843
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:27,920
uh essentially acquires a bunch of time

1844
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,039
and he's able to go

1845
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,119
to one of the higher levels and now he's

1846
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:34,880
attending all these galas and you know

1847
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,559
poker nights and all stuff

1848
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,559
and one of the first things that he

1849
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,640
learns is that in

1850
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:41,920
the lower end of society everyone is

1851
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,400
running everywhere

1852
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,559
at all times in the movie because time

1853
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,400
is so finite and it is so scarce

1854
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,280
and so therefore why would i walk down

1855
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,400
the street i must run down the street

1856
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,720
in the highest level of society no one

1857
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:59,920
runs anywhere and in fact if you run

1858
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:02,399
you are seen as lower class yeah

1859
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,559
because wealth is time and so that movie

1860
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,000
is you know it's got a ton of kind of um

1861
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:06,480
things that you can pull out of it but

1862
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,519
to me

1863
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:12,318
is the perfect epitome of money is time

1864
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:13,199
and so when you start to think about the

1865
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:15,039
acquisition

1866
00:57:13,199 --> 00:57:17,679
of money right it goes to this whole

1867
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:19,279
idea of time billionaire and i know that

1868
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:20,879
there's probably a lot of people have

1869
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,440
heard about this already but

1870
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,318
if you think of a million seconds it's

1871
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,440
about

1872
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:31,920
11 days a billion seconds is 31 years

1873
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,960
and so if i said to somebody you have to

1874
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,480
switch lives

1875
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:38,000
with warren buffett would you do it

1876
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,440
some people would say sure that'd be

1877
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,400
their initial reaction i said but you

1878
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:45,599
gotta have to be you know 92 years old

1879
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,039
is the money worth the lack of time most

1880
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:48,400
people would say no right there's this

1881
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:51,679
guy graham duncan

1882
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:53,119
who really articulated this well um and

1883
00:57:51,679 --> 00:57:54,480
ultimately what ends up happening is you

1884
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,119
realize time is more valuable than the

1885
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,159
money

1886
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:00,318
but you you acquire the money to

1887
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:02,159
gain more time and be the reason it's

1888
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:02,880
valuable is because of the scarcity of

1889
00:58:02,159 --> 00:58:06,159
time

1890
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:09,519
we currently have the the biology

1891
00:58:06,159 --> 00:58:11,199
the physics means that um

1892
00:58:09,519 --> 00:58:12,719
this is not just the narrative we tell

1893
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:15,919
ourselves maybe this

1894
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:18,639
i don't know but it it feels like

1895
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:20,400
pretty sure we're mortal and in that

1896
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,558
sense the scarcity there

1897
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,079
gives value to time it's fascinating to

1898
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:24,880
think about all the thought experiments

1899
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,440
here

1900
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:30,480
of if that could actually be on the

1901
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:33,519
economy if you can actually convert time

1902
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,119
in a frictionless way to money well and

1903
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,239
if you start to pull on this a little

1904
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,838
bit and say okay

1905
00:58:36,239 --> 00:58:40,479
a young person today let's say somebody

1906
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:42,159
in their 20s has about 2 billion seconds

1907
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,798
left in their life right kind of

1908
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:46,480
60 years give or take based on life

1909
00:58:44,798 --> 00:58:49,519
expectancy

1910
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,000
they usually until they start to

1911
00:58:49,519 --> 00:58:53,039
understand this

1912
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:56,079
concept think of wealth

1913
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:57,199
in dollar terms but dollars are being

1914
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,640
devalued

1915
00:58:57,199 --> 00:59:00,239
and so you know a million dollars

1916
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:01,279
doesn't get you what it used to get

1917
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:03,358
right it's kind of a

1918
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,640
an old adage and so what you're doing is

1919
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:07,440
you're pursuing

1920
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:08,239
something that ends up losing value and

1921
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,400
so it's

1922
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:12,000
the constant rat race it's how do i

1923
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,599
constantly try to get more how do i get

1924
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,440
more dollars how do i get more dollars

1925
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:17,200
because even if i say to myself you know

1926
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:18,480
i'm gonna retire when i get a hundred

1927
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,039
thousand dollars

1928
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:22,318
when i get the hundred thousand dollars

1929
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:23,519
the hundred thousand dollars five years

1930
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:24,639
from now doesn't buy me what i thought

1931
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,920
it did so now i need

1932
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:27,358
five hundred thousand or two hundred

1933
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,400
thousand or a million or whatever the

1934
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:30,639
number is

1935
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,519
and so ultimately what ends up occurring

1936
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:33,598
is that

1937
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,599
the bitcoin community and many people in

1938
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,680
kind of this idea of sound money

1939
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,640
is you want to be able to acquire an

1940
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:41,358
asset

1941
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:42,960
that not only will hold the value right

1942
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:45,279
the store of value over time

1943
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,318
but it will actually appreciate over

1944
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:48,079
time

1945
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,759
and so when you look at something like

1946
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:51,039
bitcoin against the dollar against other

1947
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,960
types of assets

1948
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:55,199
all of these assets are down compared to

1949
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:57,599
bitcoin right now some of that's just

1950
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:59,439
in the early days of kind of the pricing

1951
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:00,880
of an asset you go from very small to

1952
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:02,159
something much larger

1953
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,920
but now what you start to look at is

1954
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:05,039
well if you have a finite supply of

1955
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,680
something

1956
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:09,199
what ends up happening is people begin

1957
01:00:07,679 --> 01:00:11,759
to value it more

1958
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,719
and so in a world where dollars are

1959
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,119
infinite

1960
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:16,239
and other fiat currencies are infinite

1961
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:19,280
bitcoin becomes

1962
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:21,519
very very interesting very special uh

1963
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,559
and something that is very aspirational

1964
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:23,920
and so i think that's where you're

1965
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:25,519
starting to see people say wait a second

1966
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:29,200
this is something where

1967
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:31,838
that finite secure store of value

1968
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:34,000
is essential to wealth generation and

1969
01:00:31,838 --> 01:00:36,318
preservation over a long period of time

1970
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,838
and if sam harris is right that free

1971
01:00:36,318 --> 01:00:39,519
will is an illusion this is really

1972
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:43,679
interesting to think about

1973
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:45,759
maybe time is the kind of block chain

1974
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:46,798
because you can't change anything and

1975
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:51,280
then the

1976
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:53,358
physical space time of the universe is a

1977
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,319
ledger

1978
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:57,598
so maybe uh it won't be bitcoin that

1979
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:01,279
replaces gold

1980
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,680
maybe it'll be time once we crack open

1981
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,119
that

1982
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:05,039
in fact the universe is fully

1983
01:01:03,119 --> 01:01:06,798
deterministic so maybe that's what like

1984
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:08,639
eric weinstein is afraid of once you

1985
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:11,920
figure out the theories

1986
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:12,719
of everything of physics will be able to

1987
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:16,079
then start

1988
01:01:12,719 --> 01:01:18,399
trading create a market out of like the

1989
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:20,720
very fabric of reality

1990
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,079
and that way break it well if you look

1991
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:25,519
at

1992
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:27,200
infinite inflationary type currencies

1993
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:28,798
you can't do that right because it

1994
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:31,039
constantly is losing value right

1995
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:31,920
when you look at a finite asset again

1996
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:34,798
that has the

1997
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,079
provability of the actual finite element

1998
01:01:34,798 --> 01:01:39,119
to it

1999
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:42,240
ultimately the wealth is

2000
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:44,240
that marketplace yeah and so you know i

2001
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:46,479
i always uh kind of try to highlight for

2002
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:48,558
people the top 55

2003
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:49,838
of americans understand something that

2004
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:53,599
the bottom 45

2005
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:56,639
don't they invest right the bottom 45

2006
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,318
consume the top 55 percent invest and

2007
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:58,719
that's why we have a wealth and equality

2008
01:01:58,318 --> 01:02:00,639
gap

2009
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,798
and it continues to get wider and wider

2010
01:02:00,639 --> 01:02:04,798
and wider is because the people who are

2011
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:07,199
holding the devaluing assets

2012
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:08,159
and saving or watching their wealth be

2013
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,000
devalued away

2014
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:12,159
and there's arguments and controversy

2015
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,280
over how fast that's happening but it's

2016
01:02:12,159 --> 01:02:14,879
happening

2017
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,720
the people who are holding the assets

2018
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,400
that have any level of scarcity right

2019
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:20,798
real estate may not be finite

2020
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:22,559
but it's scarce right art may not be

2021
01:02:20,798 --> 01:02:25,119
finite but it's scarce

2022
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,880
gold may not be finite but it's scarce

2023
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,880
those assets continue to

2024
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,440
appreciate against the devaluing

2025
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,039
currency and so when you then say no

2026
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:37,920
i have complete finite supply

2027
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,440
with provability and this transparency

2028
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,119
around it where everyone knows

2029
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,358
how much is there and what where it's

2030
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:45,280
going now all of a sudden

2031
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:46,480
you and i can transact back and forth

2032
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:48,400
that value

2033
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,079
and it is a representation of time

2034
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,400
because what i can essentially do is if

2035
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:53,359
i

2036
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,480
gather or acquire more of that wealth i

2037
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:58,960
then can apply

2038
01:02:54,480 --> 01:03:02,559
leverage to my life i can use machines

2039
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:05,519
humans or some other resources

2040
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:07,119
and basically now free up my time yeah

2041
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:08,798
and it's not funny about the way you are

2042
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:10,318
trading time maybe it's a little bit

2043
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,880
indirect but

2044
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:13,599
maybe not uh so just because i brought

2045
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:15,680
up eric

2046
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,119
and uh you're on twitter i'd love to

2047
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:19,838
hear your opinions uh

2048
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:22,318
i talk to him a lot he seems to have

2049
01:03:19,838 --> 01:03:24,318
stepped into the beautiful dance

2050
01:03:22,318 --> 01:03:25,838
of human communication and the social

2051
01:03:24,318 --> 01:03:27,279
dynamics that is the bitcoin

2052
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:29,838
cryptocurrency community

2053
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,798
do you have uh do you have thoughts on

2054
01:03:29,838 --> 01:03:34,119
uh

2055
01:03:30,798 --> 01:03:35,838
uh engaged theoretic concepts

2056
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:37,680
conceptualization of the world there's

2057
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:39,838
just eric in general

2058
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:41,199
he's got a lot of love in his heart and

2059
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:43,279
he's got a grace in the way he

2060
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:46,318
communicates

2061
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:48,079
but he's also uh loves to play with

2062
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:49,679
ideas and seems to have touched a

2063
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,880
sensitive point with the bitcoin

2064
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:51,838
community is there anything you could

2065
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:54,400
say

2066
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:56,558
uh that's hopeful inspiring about that

2067
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:58,798
whole dynamic that went down

2068
01:03:56,559 --> 01:03:59,760
i so i don't know all of the details um

2069
01:03:58,798 --> 01:04:00,960
but what i will say

2070
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,440
is i've listened to a number of his

2071
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,960
podcasts um and

2072
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,519
him and there's a whole bunch of people

2073
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:09,599
like him i basically put them in the

2074
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:12,798
bucket of they're an independent thinker

2075
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:16,000
who are courageous enough to speak their

2076
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:19,440
truth whatever that may be they are

2077
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:21,358
humble enough to revisit their ideas

2078
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,880
and say i got this right i got this

2079
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:23,440
wrong information changed i'll change my

2080
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,599
mind

2081
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,440
it's obviously a sign of intelligence to

2082
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,480
be able to do that type of stuff

2083
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:30,240
and i actually think that one of the

2084
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:31,599
most scarce things in our society are

2085
01:04:30,239 --> 01:04:32,798
those independent thinkers who are able

2086
01:04:31,599 --> 01:04:35,200
to do all this

2087
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:35,838
right speaking of scarcity yeah and so

2088
01:04:35,199 --> 01:04:38,798
to me

2089
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:39,679
uh i put eric and a whole host of other

2090
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:40,960
people kind of

2091
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,960
if you look at like the intellectual

2092
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,400
dark web is kind of a label that's uh

2093
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,599
been used

2094
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:47,599
they're actually some of the most

2095
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:48,798
important people in our society

2096
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:51,039
because they're the people who are

2097
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:53,038
willing to stand up against the mass

2098
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,240
kind of um thought process they're

2099
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:55,839
willing to

2100
01:04:54,239 --> 01:04:58,479
talk about things that others may think

2101
01:04:55,838 --> 01:05:00,078
are taboo right they're willing to

2102
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,838
change their mind which all of a sudden

2103
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,798
has become a bad thing rather than a

2104
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:05,119
good thing

2105
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:07,038
and so when i see the exploration of

2106
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,480
ideas in public

2107
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,720
i actually think that those are the

2108
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:13,679
people who are most open

2109
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:15,118
to the kind of vehement blowback as well

2110
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:16,879
right because that's part of what

2111
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,318
they're doing is that they're eliciting

2112
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,318
hey i'm going to throw an idea into the

2113
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:21,599
arena if it doesn't get attacked they

2114
01:05:20,318 --> 01:05:23,519
actually may be more nervous

2115
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,599
than if there is some level of you know

2116
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,119
kind of war of attrition if you will

2117
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:28,559
and so what i've seen with a number of

2118
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:28,960
the people who have done this everyone

2119
01:05:28,559 --> 01:05:30,160
from

2120
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:31,519
some of the best you know hedge fund

2121
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:32,078
managers and kind of money managers in

2122
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:33,358
the world

2123
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:35,280
all the way to what i'll consider some

2124
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:36,239
of the most uh intellectual people in

2125
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,960
the world

2126
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:40,078
is they play with these ideas and they

2127
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:41,039
play with the ideas and they play with

2128
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,400
them and they play with them

2129
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:44,319
and they all arrive at the same

2130
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:46,480
conclusion and sometimes it takes

2131
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:47,679
a month sometimes it takes years but

2132
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:50,000
they arrive at this bitcoin

2133
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:52,639
thesis and what's so interesting about

2134
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,599
it is it highlights something that

2135
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:56,879
many people view as a bug but i think

2136
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,599
people in the bitcoin community view as

2137
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,318
a feature

2138
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:01,280
which is that community and so what ends

2139
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:03,038
up happening is

2140
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:05,280
when you have something that is as

2141
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:07,440
ambitious as

2142
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,960
creating a global reserve currency

2143
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:10,400
doesn't mean it needs to unseat any of

2144
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,000
the existing ones but become the global

2145
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,760
reserve currency of the internet right

2146
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,079
this digital economy

2147
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,920
you need shepherds of it and so just

2148
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,920
like a technology company wants to find

2149
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:21,920
those loyal fans that are willing to go

2150
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,480
out and market and word of mouth

2151
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,280
and and kind of not only promote it but

2152
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,480
also

2153
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,920
protect it this technology that is this

2154
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,400
decentralized thing

2155
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:35,119
which uses a financial incentive in

2156
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,960
order to elicit the buy-in uh not from a

2157
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:40,160
financial perspective but from a mental

2158
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,639
energy standpoint has built one of the

2159
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:44,239
most

2160
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:46,239
rabid powerful and engaged communities

2161
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:47,598
on the internet and what ends up

2162
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:49,679
happening is

2163
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,880
those people have thought more about

2164
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:53,519
these ideas

2165
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,119
and actually challenged those ideas more

2166
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:57,119
than anyone else in the world

2167
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,039
and so i've got a lot of folks who will

2168
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:01,039
just say there's this guy marty bent who

2169
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,720
we'll talk all the time about

2170
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,240
the bitcoin critics haven't done their

2171
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:06,318
homework in a lot of cases

2172
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:07,919
so they show up and sometimes it's super

2173
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:09,358
intellectual lazy arguments sometimes

2174
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,200
it's actually very well thought out

2175
01:07:09,358 --> 01:07:12,639
arguments you know on the counter to the

2176
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:14,558
bitcoin thesis

2177
01:07:12,639 --> 01:07:16,000
but ultimately what ends up happening is

2178
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,280
you're talking to somebody who's

2179
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,440
an expert i've been thinking about for

2180
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,640
five seven eight ten years right they've

2181
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,599
gone through every simulation you

2182
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:24,879
possibly can

2183
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:26,640
and they show up with data examples um

2184
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,000
and responses now they're not always

2185
01:07:26,639 --> 01:07:30,318
right but they've just

2186
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,480
done the work and so what i actually uh

2187
01:07:30,318 --> 01:07:33,519
like about folks like eric and others is

2188
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:34,240
as they're kind of going through this

2189
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:36,318
journey

2190
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:38,558
they're incredibly smart right and they

2191
01:07:36,318 --> 01:07:40,880
provide uh or they um

2192
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,079
apply a lot of intellectual rigor to

2193
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:43,440
some of these arguments

2194
01:07:42,079 --> 01:07:44,880
and so what it does is what does it do

2195
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:46,079
it's a marketplace it keeps people

2196
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:48,240
honest

2197
01:07:46,079 --> 01:07:50,000
so i uh let me sort of make a few

2198
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:52,159
comments it's kind of interesting uh so

2199
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:54,239
you're exactly right

2200
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:55,759
uh maybe the blowback is part of the

2201
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,879
mechanism that actually develops these

2202
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:58,960
ideas and so on

2203
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:00,960
i do want to kind of speak to a little

2204
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:02,639
bit of the toxicity that i've

2205
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,838
experienced in the bitcoin community i

2206
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:05,440
kind of see it

2207
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:07,199
the bitcoin community i think he paints

2208
01:08:05,440 --> 01:08:09,358
a really nice picture which i kind of

2209
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:12,239
see it as an immune system

2210
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:13,440
that protects against sort of uh the

2211
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:17,198
viruses

2212
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:17,759
that are bad ideas that said the immune

2213
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:21,439
system

2214
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:22,960
can destroy a body right and

2215
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:24,960
the thing you mentioned about eric and

2216
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:27,359
maybe about myself

2217
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:28,640
and in general just people exploring

2218
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,400
ideas

2219
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:32,159
is there is a dunning-kruger effect

2220
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:35,278
which is when you first

2221
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:38,798
start exploring ideas deeply you have

2222
01:08:35,279 --> 01:08:40,640
um overblown level of confidence about

2223
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:42,000
like how much you understand

2224
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,119
and that's actually the process about

2225
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,158
learning then you realize you don't

2226
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,439
understand much

2227
01:08:44,158 --> 01:08:47,278
what i've noticed with the bitcoin

2228
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,479
community is uh

2229
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:52,159
they're not as uh patient with the

2230
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:54,238
the basics of the dunning-kruger effect

2231
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:57,278
like if i step in

2232
01:08:54,238 --> 01:09:00,399
and make declarative statements about

2233
01:08:57,279 --> 01:09:01,120
bitcoin like i you know i read a long

2234
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:04,318
time ago

2235
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:06,238
uh the white paper like at the cursed

2236
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:09,359
degree level i felt

2237
01:09:06,238 --> 01:09:10,718
uh that i understand the technology this

2238
01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:12,079
is basic intuitions

2239
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:13,920
you know i didn't think about the social

2240
01:09:12,079 --> 01:09:15,679
dynamics i didn't think about any like

2241
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,759
financial implications and

2242
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:19,600
a lot of the deep actually the ongoing

2243
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,880
innovations and all that kind of stuff

2244
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,400
but i thought i understood that

2245
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:24,000
technology and so i step in and make

2246
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:24,639
declarative statements i think those are

2247
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:26,960
the

2248
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,239
the first time you say okay what's the

2249
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,000
role of bitcoin in the world you start

2250
01:09:28,238 --> 01:09:32,079
thinking about it deeply

2251
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,880
and then you make statements the

2252
01:09:32,079 --> 01:09:35,679
toxicity that you get in those first few

2253
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,440
statements

2254
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,520
is really off-putting to me i'm somebody

2255
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:43,678
that tries to communicate love and

2256
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:46,080
live that with everything i do and

2257
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:47,199
there is a level of disrespect that i've

2258
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:48,960
experienced

2259
01:09:47,198 --> 01:09:50,798
not directly just observing others

2260
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:53,679
people have been mostly kind to me

2261
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:55,119
and i appreciate that but if you're

2262
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:58,560
going to criticize me

2263
01:09:55,119 --> 01:10:00,479
about my exploration of ideas in bitcoin

2264
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,640
you have to also acknowledge that i'm a

2265
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:05,279
human being they got like a phd

2266
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:07,119
and stuff like i did some hard [ __ ] of

2267
01:10:05,279 --> 01:10:08,158
that it could be in farming or it could

2268
01:10:07,119 --> 01:10:10,079
be whatever

2269
01:10:08,158 --> 01:10:11,519
like i've lived life and i've really

2270
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:14,238
thought deeply i really care

2271
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:15,040
like i know a lot of [ __ ] and it's

2272
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:17,759
possible

2273
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:18,319
that i actually have a lot of ideas that

2274
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,679
you can

2275
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:22,479
learn from now if it's agriculture fine

2276
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,719
or if it's

2277
01:10:22,479 --> 01:10:26,399
artificial intelligence fine like i know

2278
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:27,039
what i'm talking about about certain

2279
01:10:26,399 --> 01:10:28,319
things

2280
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:29,920
and i could be wrong about a lot of

2281
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:31,198
things and there's like an exchange of

2282
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,440
ideas that's

2283
01:10:31,198 --> 01:10:34,319
that makes the that mechanism that you

2284
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:37,119
talked about

2285
01:10:34,319 --> 01:10:38,479
um more efficient sometimes when the

2286
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:41,198
blowback is too strong

2287
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:41,519
too early on the development of ideas is

2288
01:10:41,198 --> 01:10:44,000
just

2289
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:45,600
inefficient and i'm not sure if if

2290
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,439
there's a

2291
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:49,760
you know the way it was explained to me

2292
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:53,919
is that for so long

2293
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:56,800
that community was like bombarded

2294
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:57,520
with just like bad ideas like criticisms

2295
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:01,039
there's just

2296
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:03,679
overly sensitive now to like

2297
01:11:01,039 --> 01:11:05,198
to [ __ ] just they're like triggered

2298
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:06,880
by statements like

2299
01:11:05,198 --> 01:11:08,799
they've heard it all before and they're

2300
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,319
like oh there they go again with the

2301
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:13,119
same old arguments

2302
01:11:10,319 --> 01:11:14,639
but that doesn't mean that um you know

2303
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:15,920
you have to sort of i guess develop

2304
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:18,400
patience and so on

2305
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,920
especially when you feel like in my case

2306
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,639
that the person is coming from a good

2307
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:21,600
place right

2308
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:24,079
i don't know if there's something you

2309
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:25,840
could say yeah that's positive about the

2310
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:26,719
future of this kind of overcoming this

2311
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,319
toxicity

2312
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,560
i think there's a couple of trends that

2313
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:32,319
are all kind of coalescing here right

2314
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,600
in these types of experiences so one is

2315
01:11:32,319 --> 01:11:35,920
uh when you look at a community

2316
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:36,640
there's always um a spectrum right in

2317
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,158
terms of

2318
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:40,239
there's some people who over index on

2319
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:41,279
kindness uh and stupidity

2320
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:43,279
right and there's some people who over

2321
01:11:41,279 --> 01:11:44,319
index on intelligence and uh basically

2322
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:45,840
just being an [ __ ]

2323
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:47,519
right and then you get everyone in

2324
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:50,239
between and so like uh

2325
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:50,719
naturally as we know the extremist ends

2326
01:11:50,238 --> 01:11:52,399
of

2327
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:54,239
uh any community end up being the

2328
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:57,279
loudest usually right

2329
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:59,759
the second thing is um

2330
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:01,359
there is from the outsider view like in

2331
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,079
at the beginning of the exploration of

2332
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:04,079
ideas

2333
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:05,760
uh it's very much a learning process

2334
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:07,359
right it's it's

2335
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,760
i don't know if i understand this or not

2336
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:12,559
but piers ideas a b and c

2337
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:14,719
from the internal perspective there's a

2338
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,320
trillion dollars of value at stake and

2339
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:18,480
we must protect it with our lives

2340
01:12:16,319 --> 01:12:19,679
yeah right the truth's probably

2341
01:12:18,479 --> 01:12:21,599
somewhere in between there

2342
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:23,600
right again the world's not black and

2343
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:24,880
white there's this kind of more gray

2344
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,600
area that i think actually

2345
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:28,960
um is where most people exist the other

2346
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:31,920
thing that's at play here

2347
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:33,520
is uh i think the bitcoin community

2348
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,079
understands the internet and internet

2349
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,320
culture

2350
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:37,119
and uh narratives better than almost

2351
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:39,198
anyone yes

2352
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:41,119
and so you see this with kind of the uh

2353
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:44,238
the just complete destruction

2354
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:46,399
uh of narratives with memes and and um

2355
01:12:44,238 --> 01:12:47,519
just the the visceral reaction and the

2356
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:50,158
use of things like

2357
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:51,360
reddit and twitter and uh youtube

2358
01:12:50,158 --> 01:12:54,559
podcasts just

2359
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:57,279
areas where um i think a lot about uh

2360
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,640
if you are an upstart right and you are

2361
01:12:57,279 --> 01:13:02,399
going to go challenge

2362
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:04,400
the most uh well-respected elite

2363
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:05,519
kind of establishment institutions in

2364
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:08,479
the world

2365
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:08,960
if you walk in in a suit and tie and you

2366
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:12,000
say

2367
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:13,679
i'm here to debate you with ideas you're

2368
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,119
going to get your clock cleaned

2369
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:17,199
yeah right because they're going to trot

2370
01:13:15,119 --> 01:13:18,000
out their lawyers their regulators

2371
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:21,279
they're lobbyists

2372
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:21,760
right like all this stuff if you instead

2373
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:23,198
say

2374
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,480
i'm going to meme you to death on the

2375
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:26,238
internet yeah and i'm going to control

2376
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:28,079
the public narrative

2377
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:29,678
you've shifted the the power the

2378
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:32,158
asymmetry of power is more symmetrical

2379
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:34,239
now it's the ultimate insurgency

2380
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:35,439
right if you bring it back to the the

2381
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:37,839
field yes

2382
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:39,599
and so when you think about this you

2383
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,400
have to lean into the advantage that you

2384
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,560
have

2385
01:13:40,399 --> 01:13:43,439
yeah and so what ends up happening is

2386
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:46,560
you and i

2387
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:48,639
would absolutely lose it if we saw

2388
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:50,000
jp morgan or goldman sachs or the

2389
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,400
federal reserve

2390
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:54,719
start tweeting memes yeah right it would

2391
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:58,000
almost the the validation it would give

2392
01:13:54,719 --> 01:14:00,480
to the medium and the uh even playing

2393
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:03,198
field that it would provide would

2394
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:04,079
pull these establishments down to the

2395
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:06,719
level of

2396
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:07,679
what is this upstart but now what you're

2397
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:10,079
starting to see

2398
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,719
is that the bitcoin community even

2399
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:13,359
though

2400
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,760
there's some level of toxic toxicity at

2401
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:15,039
times

2402
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,800
even though there's this visceral

2403
01:14:15,039 --> 01:14:20,079
reaction sometimes

2404
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,119
there's even what i would call bullying

2405
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:22,800
or or

2406
01:14:21,119 --> 01:14:23,920
kind of outward projection of things

2407
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,480
right even though it may be a small

2408
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:26,960
percentage

2409
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:28,799
it'll happen every once in a while what

2410
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:29,920
they do understand though is that these

2411
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,480
establishments

2412
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:34,158
are made up of humans and what you can

2413
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:35,839
actually do one of the best ways to pick

2414
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:39,119
apart an institution

2415
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,520
is to recruit from inside of them one by

2416
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:41,599
one

2417
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,640
yes and so what you're starting to see

2418
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:44,400
now is

2419
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:45,679
i mean i get the messages on twitter and

2420
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:48,000
linkedin all the time

2421
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,840
hey i'm a banker by trade i'm a

2422
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,600
bitcoiner at heart

2423
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:53,039
right and so what you're doing is you're

2424
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,400
essentially infiltrating the

2425
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:57,359
organizations

2426
01:14:54,399 --> 01:14:58,158
not in in physical uh you know uh

2427
01:14:57,359 --> 01:15:00,799
population

2428
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:01,920
yeah but with the ideas and with the

2429
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,239
philosophies

2430
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:06,480
banker in the streets bitcoin are in the

2431
01:15:04,238 --> 01:15:06,479
sheets

2432
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,600
i like it uh with that said uh in terms

2433
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,719
of [ __ ] posting and memes

2434
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:18,560
i gotta say um uh like

2435
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:21,119
bring it on because i i believe

2436
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,840
um in terms of asymmetry of power i

2437
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:24,399
believe in

2438
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,440
that love will save the world not memes

2439
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:29,759
uh or at least

2440
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:31,439
the good good vibe memes as opposed to

2441
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,880
[ __ ] posting it's a it's an interesting

2442
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:34,158
battleground though

2443
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,920
it's an interesting battleground to

2444
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:36,479
think about the other thing i would say

2445
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,279
too is

2446
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:40,639
um one of the elements uh that's always

2447
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:44,479
kind of funny to me

2448
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:45,920
is how much of the entertainment is love

2449
01:15:44,479 --> 01:15:47,439
right so when you start to think about

2450
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:48,399
how many of the memes that are posted

2451
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:51,279
for example

2452
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:52,319
are for outsiders versus insiders yes

2453
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:54,800
laser eyes

2454
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:55,759
right which seems absolutely ridiculous

2455
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:59,119
elementary and

2456
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:01,600
and uh frankly uh beneath anyone in any

2457
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:03,760
level of power or influence in the world

2458
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,120
somehow has congressmen and senators who

2459
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:07,600
have done it yeah

2460
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:08,399
they're not trying to uh convince their

2461
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:10,400
colleagues

2462
01:16:08,399 --> 01:16:11,439
in uh elected positions to become

2463
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,119
bitcoiners yeah

2464
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:14,639
they're speaking directly internally to

2465
01:16:13,119 --> 01:16:17,119
the bitcoin community yeah

2466
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,679
there's some sense in which yes memes is

2467
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:21,039
love

2468
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:23,920
even if hearing bitcoin is love

2469
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:24,399
they're trying to convert me uh the one

2470
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,399
that you

2471
01:16:24,399 --> 01:16:27,759
the you uh you have to laugh at right

2472
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:29,359
probably my favorite one out of all that

2473
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,000
is i've seen on multiple occasions

2474
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:32,639
uh you know mark cuban a couple of years

2475
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,640
ago

2476
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:36,640
kevin o'leary whoever you know wealthy

2477
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,159
people billionaires et cetera

2478
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,679
and you have people on anonymous

2479
01:16:38,158 --> 01:16:43,119
accounts who knows who they are

2480
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,119
telling them have fun staying poor

2481
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:46,879
and it's just you know it's just again

2482
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,960
part of a community and i think it

2483
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,880
it's uh it's a feature not a bug there's

2484
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:53,119
bad aspects to it at times

2485
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:55,600
but i do think it's a net positive it's

2486
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,119
just like the immune system

2487
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:59,600
it does a lot of crappy stuff but

2488
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:02,158
overall it's a it's a major

2489
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,280
net positive maybe this is a bit of a

2490
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:06,479
personal question for me

2491
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:08,559
just out of my own curiosity but i've uh

2492
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:09,519
talked to ray daly a few times so ray

2493
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,360
dalio i think

2494
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:12,719
was one of those people that took the

2495
01:17:11,359 --> 01:17:15,920
that that journey

2496
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:18,079
uh the the the bitcoin journey gift give

2497
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:20,079
thoughts about him specifically

2498
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:21,359
about that whole world and about the

2499
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:23,119
journey maybe of others

2500
01:17:21,359 --> 01:17:25,359
that are going through the same process

2501
01:17:23,119 --> 01:17:26,880
because ray is

2502
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:28,799
at least from my perspective i'm a bit

2503
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:32,400
of an outsider he's

2504
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:35,440
one of the most uh insightful

2505
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:36,399
and deep thinkers about investment about

2506
01:17:35,439 --> 01:17:39,599
finance about

2507
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:40,079
economics in general uh actually about

2508
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,480
life

2509
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:43,279
so it's interesting to see him go on

2510
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:44,479
that journey

2511
01:17:43,279 --> 01:17:46,399
do you have something in common about

2512
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:46,959
rey or just those kinds of people in

2513
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:48,799
general

2514
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:50,399
so if we look at um what i'll just

2515
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,520
consider the legends of wall street in

2516
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,960
general yeah right

2517
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:54,960
um there's no denying that they're

2518
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,760
incredibly intelligent uh there's no

2519
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,119
denying that

2520
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,079
actually especially in the hedge fund

2521
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,039
world they're some of the most

2522
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:01,119
open-minded

2523
01:17:59,039 --> 01:18:02,158
people uh in terms of they're willing to

2524
01:18:01,119 --> 01:18:03,519
change their mind when they get new

2525
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:05,039
information

2526
01:18:03,520 --> 01:18:07,120
there's no doubt that they are

2527
01:18:05,039 --> 01:18:08,880
historians in the sense of having

2528
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:10,319
studied financial markets and cycles

2529
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,159
over time

2530
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,920
and also uh one of the things that i

2531
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:15,759
really respect about all those guys is

2532
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:18,239
almost all of them are willing to put

2533
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:18,960
ideas out uh via various writings that

2534
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:21,119
they do

2535
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,039
uh and accept the public criticism right

2536
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:24,479
whether it's howard marx ray or others

2537
01:18:23,039 --> 01:18:26,640
uh they will put this stuff out in

2538
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:27,519
public and uh sure there's a lot of

2539
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,840
people who

2540
01:18:27,520 --> 01:18:30,880
um are supportive and kind of are part

2541
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,400
of a fan base

2542
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,760
if you will but there's a lot of people

2543
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:34,559
who also think that sometimes they say

2544
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:36,159
stupid things

2545
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:38,239
and so putting that out takes kind of

2546
01:18:36,158 --> 01:18:39,439
courage right um

2547
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:41,439
i think ray's actually the most

2548
01:18:39,439 --> 01:18:43,519
fascinating though out of all of these

2549
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:46,319
kind of legends of wall street in that

2550
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:47,760
um he understands debt cycles he

2551
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:51,198
understands currencies

2552
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:53,760
he for a while now has been all over

2553
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:54,238
and famously said you know cash's trash

2554
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:56,079
uh

2555
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:57,759
investable assets right he just he kind

2556
01:18:56,079 --> 01:18:59,198
of like just knew all of it

2557
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:00,800
and for a long time bitcoiners have said

2558
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:02,000
ray you understand the bitcoin argument

2559
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:02,400
you're just missing the last part which

2560
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,479
is

2561
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:07,119
bitcoin's the solution right and so he

2562
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:09,678
was gold and some other ideas but

2563
01:19:07,119 --> 01:19:11,279
i think that he's a perfect example of

2564
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:14,560
when you are part of

2565
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:16,000
uh the establishment people view you in

2566
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,719
a very static way as

2567
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,960
uh the leader of a part of establishment

2568
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:22,158
but whether it's bill gates ray dalio or

2569
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,000
somebody else

2570
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:25,599
each one of these people were innovators

2571
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:27,119
and challengers to a system they were

2572
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,480
upstarts at one point

2573
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:29,840
and so it's kind of this idea that like

2574
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:31,198
if you live long enough you eventually

2575
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:33,360
become the man

2576
01:19:31,198 --> 01:19:34,479
right and so you know gates is a good

2577
01:19:33,359 --> 01:19:36,238
example right

2578
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,319
warren buffett is a good example ray

2579
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:40,000
dalio's a good example etc and so

2580
01:19:38,319 --> 01:19:41,519
uh you have to give credit i think to

2581
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:44,158
dalio in the sense of

2582
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:44,560
he kept an open mind about all of this

2583
01:19:44,158 --> 01:19:47,439
and

2584
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:49,199
more so than many of his peers has

2585
01:19:47,439 --> 01:19:50,559
continued to do the work and come around

2586
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:52,559
to this idea

2587
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,480
and now i don't want to know if i want

2588
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:57,039
to say that he's a bitcoin proponent

2589
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:59,279
as much as he believes it is one of you

2590
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:00,399
know a portion of assets that can be a

2591
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:02,960
solution

2592
01:20:00,399 --> 01:20:04,639
and so to me when you start to convince

2593
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,079
those types of people when it's you know

2594
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:06,880
paul tudor jones or stanley

2595
01:20:06,079 --> 01:20:09,359
druckenmiller

2596
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,159
ray dalio howard mark's now even writing

2597
01:20:09,359 --> 01:20:12,559
about it saying hey

2598
01:20:10,158 --> 01:20:13,519
you know i was anti-bitcoin i didn't put

2599
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,760
a ton of intellectual

2600
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,040
rigor into it but thank god my son

2601
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:19,039
bought a bunch of our family

2602
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:20,479
right and uh and kind of we've had

2603
01:20:19,039 --> 01:20:22,158
exposure to it

2604
01:20:20,479 --> 01:20:23,519
i think what it does is more than

2605
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:24,719
anything it's not going to convince

2606
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:28,000
somebody to go and

2607
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:29,840
um you know take it seriously or

2608
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,719
go ahead and make an allocation it

2609
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:34,560
reduces career risk and so if all of a

2610
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:36,158
sudden when paul tudor jones and stanley

2611
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,239
dracula come out and say hey i own

2612
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:40,000
bitcoin and here's why

2613
01:20:38,238 --> 01:20:42,000
every other investor on wall street now

2614
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,840
can say to an investment committee

2615
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,039
well it's good enough for paul tudor

2616
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:46,239
jones it's good enough for stanley

2617
01:20:45,039 --> 01:20:47,920
druckenmiller

2618
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:49,599
and so i think that it's very

2619
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,319
interesting because rey doesn't just

2620
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:53,440
represent

2621
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:54,719
wall street i think ray in some weird

2622
01:20:53,439 --> 01:20:57,919
way represents this like

2623
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:59,119
macro economic investor and so some of

2624
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,840
those are in hedge funds and some of

2625
01:20:59,119 --> 01:21:01,359
those

2626
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,199
people would be like cios at

2627
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:04,799
organizations some of them would be at

2628
01:21:03,198 --> 01:21:06,559
corporations and some of them are just

2629
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:08,960
kind of retail investors

2630
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,239
and so you can see this kind of

2631
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:12,399
inflection point

2632
01:21:10,238 --> 01:21:14,319
throughout the adoption of bitcoin right

2633
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:16,399
there was infrastructure that got built

2634
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:17,359
okay that kind of led to more adoption

2635
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:19,198
there was

2636
01:21:17,359 --> 01:21:21,679
certain individuals right usually they

2637
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,919
were kind of technology oriented

2638
01:21:21,679 --> 01:21:25,359
entrepreneurial billionaires they would

2639
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:26,880
buy it and come out and say it okay that

2640
01:21:25,359 --> 01:21:29,279
led to inflection points

2641
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,199
uh you started to have some of these

2642
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:34,158
kind of wall street legends

2643
01:21:31,198 --> 01:21:34,719
come out started financial institutions

2644
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:36,399
started

2645
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,319
now you're seeing corporations start to

2646
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:39,759
do it right eventually there's gonna be

2647
01:21:38,319 --> 01:21:41,119
a central bank that does it

2648
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,960
and so you kind of walk through that

2649
01:21:41,119 --> 01:21:44,479
line and what you understand it's like

2650
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,079
it's the same thing every time it's just

2651
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:47,678
somebody new

2652
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:49,920
right that that path right that

2653
01:21:47,679 --> 01:21:52,399
bitcoiner's journey if you will

2654
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:53,039
and i think that that is almost the

2655
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:56,479
beauty

2656
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:57,359
of it is uh if you short circuit the

2657
01:21:56,479 --> 01:21:58,399
journey

2658
01:21:57,359 --> 01:22:00,719
it's almost like somebody doesn't

2659
01:21:58,399 --> 01:22:02,638
appreciate it right if you take let's

2660
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,760
say somebody who's a young kid and you

2661
01:22:02,639 --> 01:22:05,440
just give them a bunch of money and they

2662
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:08,320
didn't have to work hard for it

2663
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:08,799
they don't really appreciate it and uh

2664
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:10,399
ray

2665
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:11,840
ray actually has the book principles

2666
01:22:10,399 --> 01:22:12,879
right and he talks about the hero's

2667
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,199
journey so

2668
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,400
he's like living in some sense in terms

2669
01:22:15,198 --> 01:22:18,638
of

2670
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:19,920
you know thinking about digital currency

2671
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:22,960
in general like

2672
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,719
digital finance it's one of the big

2673
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:27,840
transitions

2674
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:30,719
transformations of our world

2675
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:32,000
in some sense it's not just about money

2676
01:22:30,719 --> 01:22:33,679
or you could argue that money is

2677
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:36,000
everything i mean it's like

2678
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:37,600
money isn't just the the narrow

2679
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,079
definition of money money is really

2680
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:40,159
everything

2681
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:42,639
and so we're you could argue that sort

2682
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:44,879
of uh cryptocurrency

2683
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:46,880
is like the base layer of this

2684
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,400
transformation to the digital space and

2685
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,719
everything else will just be

2686
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:52,000
built on top of it i use a different

2687
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:54,399
word um

2688
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:55,198
that i think is kind of closer to your

2689
01:22:54,399 --> 01:22:57,920
world which is

2690
01:22:55,198 --> 01:22:58,559
it's ultimately automation and what i

2691
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,760
mean by that

2692
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:03,360
is uh you know before 1970 or 1980 all

2693
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,719
the assets were analog

2694
01:23:03,359 --> 01:23:06,158
and so when you have analog assets

2695
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:07,760
physical stock certificates physical

2696
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:10,638
bonds right physical

2697
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,440
deed to a home you have to physically

2698
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:14,960
exchange them

2699
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:17,519
yeah when we wanted to increase

2700
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:19,119
transactions and increase kind of global

2701
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,800
finance and access

2702
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:23,119
we took those physical assets and we

2703
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:25,119
created electronic qsip assets so now we

2704
01:23:23,119 --> 01:23:25,920
have in centralized databases kind of a

2705
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:27,679
file

2706
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:28,960
represents the asset that's sitting

2707
01:23:27,679 --> 01:23:30,399
somewhere in custody

2708
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,158
and you and i can transact them a little

2709
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:33,359
bit easier but still centralized there's

2710
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:35,279
still some bureaucracy

2711
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:36,479
and you know maybe it takes two days to

2712
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:38,000
transact rather than

2713
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:39,678
actually mailing it across the other

2714
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,158
world

2715
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:43,920
now what we're seeing is a transition

2716
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:45,279
from those electronic q-sips to these

2717
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,119
digital assets

2718
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:49,279
and so if you look at again just let's

2719
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:50,479
say money uh or currency

2720
01:23:49,279 --> 01:23:52,079
every currency in the world is going to

2721
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:52,559
be digital you're gonna have a digital

2722
01:23:52,079 --> 01:23:55,679
dollar

2723
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:58,880
a digital euro yen rmb you're gonna have

2724
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:00,880
decentralized uh kind of open source uh

2725
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,319
money like bitcoin you're also gonna

2726
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,639
have private currencies

2727
01:24:02,319 --> 01:24:06,238
like facebook's attempt at dm uh and

2728
01:24:04,639 --> 01:24:06,960
there will be others that will try to do

2729
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:09,279
this

2730
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,319
and so when you get everything digital

2731
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:12,000
right and i think that's the kind of

2732
01:24:10,319 --> 01:24:13,920
first step everyone focuses on

2733
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:15,198
the competition at the technology layer

2734
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,800
essentially goes away

2735
01:24:15,198 --> 01:24:18,158
you get some level of feature parity and

2736
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,679
sure there's bells and whistles on each

2737
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:20,479
kind of implementation of a digital

2738
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:21,840
currency

2739
01:24:20,479 --> 01:24:23,919
but at the end of the day the technology

2740
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,600
is relatively the same and ultimately

2741
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,800
what it will do is it will facilitate

2742
01:24:25,600 --> 01:24:28,639
the adoption of

2743
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,679
digital wallets so you have to have a

2744
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,359
digital wallet regardless of what

2745
01:24:29,679 --> 01:24:33,279
digital currency you have same with me

2746
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:34,880
same with everybody else in the world

2747
01:24:33,279 --> 01:24:37,198
but what it does do is when you

2748
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,440
kind of uh push away and reduce the

2749
01:24:37,198 --> 01:24:40,960
friction of competition at the

2750
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:44,000
technology layer it moves the

2751
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:45,439
competition to the monetary policy layer

2752
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,039
and so when you get to that layer now

2753
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:48,638
often it becomes interesting because all

2754
01:24:47,039 --> 01:24:50,560
of the currencies are the same

2755
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:51,840
except for this one right now and maybe

2756
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:53,920
there will be others in the future

2757
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:55,440
uh but but for sure bitcoin today and

2758
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:56,960
people may try to replicate in a private

2759
01:24:55,439 --> 01:24:58,158
manner or something but bitcoin is kind

2760
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,920
of the the only

2761
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:04,158
finite scarce digital cell money and so

2762
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:05,279
when you then have that pretty big

2763
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:06,799
difference in that competition at the

2764
01:25:05,279 --> 01:25:08,719
monetary policy layer

2765
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,000
it's actually not going to matter where

2766
01:25:08,719 --> 01:25:12,000
you get paid

2767
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:14,479
right and what i mean by that is like

2768
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:17,600
you and i both live in a single currency

2769
01:25:14,479 --> 01:25:20,399
environment i get paid in dollars

2770
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:21,600
i historically have saved in dollars all

2771
01:25:20,399 --> 01:25:24,719
of the assets in my life

2772
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:26,960
are denominated in dollars and i owe

2773
01:25:24,719 --> 01:25:29,198
my debts in dollars whether it's taxes

2774
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,399
or in the private market

2775
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:32,399
and i don't have to worry about foreign

2776
01:25:30,399 --> 01:25:33,519
currencies i don't exchange anything the

2777
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:34,799
only time i would ever think about in

2778
01:25:33,520 --> 01:25:35,360
other currencies if i'm going to another

2779
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:38,000
country

2780
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:39,439
in their single currency environment and

2781
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,079
in order to

2782
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:42,719
change or exchange my currency i go to

2783
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:44,479
the bank

2784
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,158
or i go get ripped off at the airport

2785
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:47,198
right like those are my two options so

2786
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:49,519
it's high friction

2787
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:50,559
to change between currencies when the

2788
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,199
competition

2789
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:54,320
of technology is kind of um innovated

2790
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:56,158
away

2791
01:25:54,319 --> 01:25:57,599
now i can get paid in dollars these

2792
01:25:56,158 --> 01:25:59,039
digital dollars and with a click of a

2793
01:25:57,600 --> 01:26:00,159
button switching to any other currency

2794
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:02,399
in the world

2795
01:26:00,158 --> 01:26:04,638
and so what ultimately happens is value

2796
01:26:02,399 --> 01:26:05,279
and liquidity is going to coalesce

2797
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:07,679
around

2798
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:08,880
the best monetary policy and so you get

2799
01:26:07,679 --> 01:26:10,000
in this very weird world where even if

2800
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:11,359
the united states says hey you're gonna

2801
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:12,479
get paid in dollars you have to pay your

2802
01:26:11,359 --> 01:26:14,000
taxes in dollars

2803
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:15,678
you're gonna start to see people operate

2804
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:17,039
in a multi-currency environment where

2805
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:19,119
they say okay i got paid my digital

2806
01:26:17,039 --> 01:26:20,960
dollar click a button i save in bitcoin

2807
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:22,399
it stays there protects or grows my

2808
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:23,920
purchasing power oh i need to pay my

2809
01:26:22,399 --> 01:26:26,000
taxes let me switch back into dollars

2810
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:28,560
with click of a button and pay

2811
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:30,079
when you go to a multi-currency world

2812
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:32,560
it's not just about currency

2813
01:26:30,079 --> 01:26:33,679
it's now multi-asset world because not

2814
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,320
only is the

2815
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:38,319
currency digitized but that same

2816
01:26:36,319 --> 01:26:41,279
technology is used to digitize

2817
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:42,960
stocks bonds and commodities as well and

2818
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:44,479
so today we live in a very fragmented

2819
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,439
financial world where basically i have a

2820
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:46,959
brokerage account

2821
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:49,439
i have a bank account i may have an

2822
01:26:46,960 --> 01:26:50,960
alternative asset account etc

2823
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:52,879
when i can put all those assets in a

2824
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,679
single digital wallet

2825
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:57,279
and i can then go from asset to asset

2826
01:26:55,679 --> 01:26:58,239
without having to go back to a single

2827
01:26:57,279 --> 01:27:00,559
unit of account

2828
01:26:58,238 --> 01:27:01,439
like frictionless uh going from acid to

2829
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,120
asset yeah

2830
01:27:01,439 --> 01:27:04,799
so now what you end up doing is you

2831
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:06,960
start to open up the possibility for

2832
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,679
machine-to-machine transactions

2833
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:11,439
so today if you and i write software

2834
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:12,079
code for two machines to transact with

2835
01:27:11,439 --> 01:27:13,919
each other

2836
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:16,000
yeah they can't transact physical

2837
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:17,840
currency and in many cases they can't

2838
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:19,520
actually transact the electronic q-sip

2839
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,800
currencies or assets either

2840
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,719
because there's too long of a settlement

2841
01:27:20,800 --> 01:27:24,159
time so you can't get true automation

2842
01:27:22,719 --> 01:27:26,158
right so the whole idea of like the

2843
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:28,000
car's going to drive over a strip in the

2844
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,599
road it's going to pay the toll

2845
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,800
right well that can't happen right now

2846
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:32,320
because literally the transaction won't

2847
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,320
go through right

2848
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:35,359
and so i always joke that like in an

2849
01:27:34,319 --> 01:27:37,439
automated world

2850
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:39,119
it's like a cd-rom but we're trying to

2851
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:40,000
take cassette tape player assets and put

2852
01:27:39,119 --> 01:27:41,439
it in the cd-rom

2853
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,920
it's just incompatible technology

2854
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:44,479
references nobody understands at this

2855
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,760
point

2856
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:47,279
oh by the way you need to update your

2857
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,880
references i probably do it's like

2858
01:27:47,279 --> 01:27:49,519
taking a cd-rom trying to put an mp3

2859
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:52,319
player

2860
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:53,199
into uh streaming but but i think that

2861
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:54,559
the reason why that becomes really

2862
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:57,279
interesting is when you start to

2863
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:58,639
create these digital assets now you open

2864
01:27:57,279 --> 01:27:59,920
up the world of possibilities

2865
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:01,679
so when new technology is created you

2866
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,440
can do two things you can either create

2867
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:04,960
new things the world's never seen before

2868
01:28:03,439 --> 01:28:05,678
or you can use it to improve the old

2869
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:07,679
world

2870
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:08,800
most people because it's the easiest

2871
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:11,279
thing to think about

2872
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:12,800
want to improve the old world so an

2873
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:14,800
equivalent of this would be

2874
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,159
when the internet came along a media

2875
01:28:14,800 --> 01:28:17,920
company that had newspapers

2876
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:19,279
would say hey we should take a pdf of

2877
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,000
the newspaper and we should put it on a

2878
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:21,279
website

2879
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:22,560
and now anyone in the world can go to

2880
01:28:21,279 --> 01:28:23,599
this website they can read the newspaper

2881
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:26,400
today

2882
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:28,079
that was valuable but it missed out on

2883
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:30,719
the ability to change headlines

2884
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:31,840
to test to put multimedia to distribute

2885
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:33,359
it differently to

2886
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,880
you know do all kinds of things that

2887
01:28:33,359 --> 01:28:35,920
today we understand the internet really

2888
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:37,440
empowered

2889
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,880
and so what i think we're about to watch

2890
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:39,439
happen is we're going to digitize the

2891
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,440
assets

2892
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:42,479
we're going to put them all into these

2893
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:43,759
digital wallets

2894
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:45,119
you're going to get automated

2895
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,400
technologies where machines cannot

2896
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:48,880
transact with each other

2897
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:50,079
and we're going to do simple things like

2898
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:53,279
why do we pay

2899
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:54,719
people once every two weeks why don't we

2900
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:56,880
just pay them at the end of every day

2901
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:58,800
or why don't i literally stream payments

2902
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,319
to you yeah on an hour-by-hour basis

2903
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,719
based on the work you do

2904
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:04,399
it would solve incredible economic

2905
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:05,439
issues in our country and in countries

2906
01:29:04,399 --> 01:29:07,039
around the world

2907
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:09,439
but historically businesses can't do

2908
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:10,639
this because the technology problem

2909
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:11,759
they can't keep track of it all how do

2910
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:13,039
they pay everyone every day how do they

2911
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,280
pay everyone every hour like

2912
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:16,800
you just can't do it yeah it's funny the

2913
01:29:15,279 --> 01:29:18,158
the the vision of the future you're

2914
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:21,279
painting

2915
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:22,479
it's kind of an exciting one and it

2916
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:24,079
almost makes me sad

2917
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:26,079
looking into the future when we'll look

2918
01:29:24,079 --> 01:29:29,119
back at this time it's like

2919
01:29:26,079 --> 01:29:32,238
is how incredibly inefficient

2920
01:29:29,119 --> 01:29:34,960
our financial transactions were like the

2921
01:29:32,238 --> 01:29:37,359
transaction of value of any kind

2922
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:38,000
like how like what to pay each other

2923
01:29:37,359 --> 01:29:41,119
like there has

2924
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:42,479
like processes there's like payroll and

2925
01:29:41,119 --> 01:29:44,000
all this kind of

2926
01:29:42,479 --> 01:29:46,000
just the the entirety of the

2927
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:48,560
transactions is just

2928
01:29:46,000 --> 01:29:49,439
like painful almost all transactions are

2929
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,920
painful

2930
01:29:49,439 --> 01:29:52,479
and even and the companies that innovate

2931
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:55,520
to make

2932
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:57,119
the transactions a little bit more

2933
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:58,719
frictionless like amazon with the

2934
01:29:57,119 --> 01:30:00,719
one-click purchase button

2935
01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:02,158
like went out huge but even that's

2936
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:03,520
really painful

2937
01:30:02,158 --> 01:30:05,039
so it's actually really interesting

2938
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:06,719
especially then you start to move that

2939
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:08,079
into the space of data

2940
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:11,198
there's a lot of people thinking about

2941
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:14,319
privacy and data and like can we put

2942
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:17,279
can we uh like convert data into

2943
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:19,198
like money it's just so that you can pay

2944
01:30:17,279 --> 01:30:20,880
for how much you reveal to the companies

2945
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:22,238
about your own private data that can

2946
01:30:20,880 --> 01:30:24,560
then be

2947
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:25,919
used to assign value to you so you can

2948
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,600
use a service for free

2949
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,840
if you hand over the data but there's

2950
01:30:27,600 --> 01:30:31,679
like explicit transaction going on

2951
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,880
so you can empower all those kinds of

2952
01:30:31,679 --> 01:30:35,359
things

2953
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,960
that uh will just like fundamentally

2954
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:38,000
change our world that's that's really

2955
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,198
really really exciting

2956
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,439
one of one of the most interesting

2957
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:42,399
things to me um is i invested in a

2958
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:43,839
company called bridget

2959
01:30:42,399 --> 01:30:45,439
what they told me was they said eight

2960
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:48,880
billion dollars

2961
01:30:45,439 --> 01:30:52,079
was paid to the top four banks last year

2962
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:53,279
on overdraft fees okay so literally they

2963
01:30:52,079 --> 01:30:54,479
took eight billion dollars from people

2964
01:30:53,279 --> 01:30:55,279
who didn't have money in their bank

2965
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:57,359
account

2966
01:30:55,279 --> 01:30:58,800
right and so when you dig into why is

2967
01:30:57,359 --> 01:31:00,639
that a lot of times it's not that

2968
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,000
the people don't have the money it's

2969
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:03,920
actually a mismatch of

2970
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,039
the payments yeah so what ends up

2971
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:05,840
happening is you get paid on the first

2972
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:08,238
and the 15th

2973
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:10,400
but on the 12th your netflix bill hits

2974
01:31:08,238 --> 01:31:12,000
on the 13th you went grocery shopping

2975
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:14,000
and on the 14th your car payments

2976
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:14,960
hit you overdraft and then on the 15th

2977
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,840
you actually get the check and then

2978
01:31:14,960 --> 01:31:17,359
you're able to pay not only the

2979
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,679
overdraft but for the

2980
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:21,198
expenses that you have and so something

2981
01:31:19,679 --> 01:31:22,399
as simple as just getting paid at the

2982
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:24,479
end of every day

2983
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:25,920
immediately would eliminate you know

2984
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:28,319
some big percentage of those eight

2985
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,239
billion dollars of value that flows to

2986
01:31:28,319 --> 01:31:32,399
large institutions on overdraft fees

2987
01:31:30,238 --> 01:31:34,158
yeah and also i mean this whole process

2988
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:36,000
with overdraft fees

2989
01:31:34,158 --> 01:31:37,279
and just many of the financial

2990
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:38,319
transactions we have to live through

2991
01:31:37,279 --> 01:31:42,479
today

2992
01:31:38,319 --> 01:31:45,198
forces many of us to be like accountants

2993
01:31:42,479 --> 01:31:46,959
like to understand uh the different

2994
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:49,439
mechanism of financial like

2995
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:51,039
movement of money as opposed to you

2996
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:51,519
which is what we want to do as human

2997
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:54,079
beings

2998
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:56,719
operating in higher layers of like

2999
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:59,198
providing services for others

3000
01:31:56,719 --> 01:32:00,000
of like following your passions and like

3001
01:31:59,198 --> 01:32:03,359
working for

3002
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:06,079
others like doing cool [ __ ] or or

3003
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:07,759
you know basically providing value

3004
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:09,198
exchanging value in the world and not

3005
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:11,360
thinking about the money

3006
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:13,519
the money takes care of itself and then

3007
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:16,799
you see the results of it so you're

3008
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:20,400
you're able to think in terms of

3009
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:22,960
money but not have to know

3010
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:23,920
how the like the accounting works

3011
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:25,920
automation

3012
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:27,279
simply frees humans up to do more

3013
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:29,679
creative work yeah

3014
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:31,599
right yeah like that like that's it yeah

3015
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:33,440
and which is why they use the term

3016
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,039
which is why you use the term automation

3017
01:32:33,439 --> 01:32:37,359
which i think is kind of brilliant

3018
01:32:35,039 --> 01:32:38,079
uh reframing of all this yeah because

3019
01:32:37,359 --> 01:32:40,319
ultimately

3020
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:42,479
digital technologies are merely the

3021
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:45,679
conduit to usher us into that world

3022
01:32:42,479 --> 01:32:46,079
yeah and i think the most fascinating

3023
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:49,359
part

3024
01:32:46,079 --> 01:32:52,238
of this entire industry is

3025
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:53,279
people who are trying to figure out now

3026
01:32:52,238 --> 01:32:54,559
that we're going to have these digital

3027
01:32:53,279 --> 01:32:56,880
technologies

3028
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,760
how do we usher in that automated world

3029
01:32:56,880 --> 01:32:59,440
faster

3030
01:32:57,760 --> 01:33:01,119
and so there's people who are building

3031
01:32:59,439 --> 01:33:02,158
all kinds of incredible things right

3032
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:05,359
there's literally

3033
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:08,479
um some technologies where you can

3034
01:33:05,359 --> 01:33:09,279
stream uh for paying for consumption of

3035
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:11,678
content

3036
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:13,840
yeah right there's i saw somebody

3037
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:16,480
recently who they basically said hey

3038
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:17,520
i have created something but it's not

3039
01:33:16,479 --> 01:33:19,439
gonna be released

3040
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,560
until everyone and almost like a

3041
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:23,279
gofundme type

3042
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:24,480
situation pays for in combination then

3043
01:33:23,279 --> 01:33:25,679
it gets unlocked

3044
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:27,439
and so when you start to think about

3045
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:29,679
this it's not only innovation on the

3046
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:32,799
technology front it's innovation around

3047
01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:34,158
the way that we form capital it's the

3048
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:35,840
way that we

3049
01:33:34,158 --> 01:33:38,000
organize resources it's the way that we

3050
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:39,600
build companies it's the business models

3051
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,479
right it's the application of those

3052
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:43,280
technologies

3053
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:44,079
all that stuff starts to change and go

3054
01:33:43,279 --> 01:33:48,238
back to

3055
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:50,238
20 uh 2007 is when the iphone came out

3056
01:33:48,238 --> 01:33:51,599
uber wasn't possible right he's going

3057
01:33:50,238 --> 01:33:53,359
online like all these companies that

3058
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:55,120
weren't possible before

3059
01:33:53,359 --> 01:33:57,039
when the digital technologies are kind

3060
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:59,039
of adopted on a global scale

3061
01:33:57,039 --> 01:34:01,519
i think that we all myself included

3062
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:04,479
drastically underestimate how

3063
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:05,360
fast and how big innovation can be uh

3064
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:06,718
because it's just hard

3065
01:34:05,359 --> 01:34:08,000
right like like we like to think

3066
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:08,480
linearly and that's not how the world

3067
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:11,520
works

3068
01:34:08,479 --> 01:34:12,399
yeah i i do find it kind of interesting

3069
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,880
uh

3070
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:15,839
it is nft based but uh i i don't think

3071
01:34:14,880 --> 01:34:19,359
it has to be

3072
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:22,560
this uh this idea of i think

3073
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:24,960
big clout it's called or whatever uh the

3074
01:34:22,560 --> 01:34:26,639
idea of sort of investing in individuals

3075
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,239
it makes me immediately think about

3076
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:31,600
investing in

3077
01:34:28,238 --> 01:34:35,279
ideas so even just the words you speak

3078
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:37,760
having value and sort of

3079
01:34:35,279 --> 01:34:39,119
if you have a frictionless like

3080
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,760
automated

3081
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:43,760
financial system then you could do a

3082
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:46,239
bunch of interesting things about

3083
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:47,840
what it means to add value to the world

3084
01:34:46,238 --> 01:34:49,839
i mean

3085
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:52,159
i don't know if bit cloud is currently

3086
01:34:49,840 --> 01:34:55,520
an efficient representation of that

3087
01:34:52,158 --> 01:34:59,359
but i am truly happy

3088
01:34:55,520 --> 01:35:02,639
that however that thing works

3089
01:34:59,359 --> 01:35:04,238
i'm just one notch above vladimir putin

3090
01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:05,920
which is one of the that's like one of

3091
01:35:04,238 --> 01:35:08,319
the bucket list items for me

3092
01:35:05,920 --> 01:35:08,960
to have a list where i'm one notch above

3093
01:35:08,319 --> 01:35:10,399
putin

3094
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,560
well what i think you're talking about

3095
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:15,118
here is important because there's

3096
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,600
uh historical examples you could invest

3097
01:35:15,118 --> 01:35:18,158
in

3098
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:18,800
a patent in some situations you could

3099
01:35:18,158 --> 01:35:21,198
invest in

3100
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:21,920
an organization that has an idea right

3101
01:35:21,198 --> 01:35:24,000
so these are

3102
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:25,279
super inefficient given kind of the

3103
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,719
vision that you're painting in terms of

3104
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:28,880
like investing directly in an idea in a

3105
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:31,039
super efficient automated fashion

3106
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,920
but that's how the technology evolution

3107
01:35:31,039 --> 01:35:34,158
works right

3108
01:35:31,920 --> 01:35:35,920
is it's really hard to do it first and

3109
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:37,039
then slowly kind of becomes easier and

3110
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,279
easier as technology

3111
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:40,238
uh is more prevalent the other thing

3112
01:35:39,279 --> 01:35:42,079
that i think is interesting is this

3113
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:43,919
whole idea of investing in people

3114
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:45,760
if you really think about the

3115
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:46,960
origination of that is i would hire

3116
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:49,039
somebody

3117
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,239
right i pay you money and then you're

3118
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:52,000
going to create production

3119
01:35:50,238 --> 01:35:54,319
but i take the lion's share and you

3120
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:56,479
don't now there's things like

3121
01:35:54,319 --> 01:35:58,479
these isas these income sharing

3122
01:35:56,479 --> 01:36:00,238
agreements where basically i will

3123
01:35:58,479 --> 01:36:02,718
educate you on something train you on

3124
01:36:00,238 --> 01:36:04,479
something i'll put up capital

3125
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:06,480
right and then over time you'll pay me

3126
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:09,039
back plus profits

3127
01:36:06,479 --> 01:36:10,319
as some version eventually i don't know

3128
01:36:09,039 --> 01:36:13,439
what it looks like

3129
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:15,118
but being able to get upside in

3130
01:36:13,439 --> 01:36:17,359
somebody's success

3131
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:18,799
for having risk capital early on doesn't

3132
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:20,479
seem that far off

3133
01:36:18,800 --> 01:36:22,320
seen in professional sports you see it

3134
01:36:20,479 --> 01:36:25,198
in you know a lot of these things and so

3135
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:25,840
i just think that a lot of um the focus

3136
01:36:25,198 --> 01:36:28,799
right now

3137
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,159
is on the technology but ultimately

3138
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:32,639
these are

3139
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:34,399
ideas that are very old and have had

3140
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:36,079
lots of success and traction and we're

3141
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:38,319
just merely standing in the way of the

3142
01:36:36,079 --> 01:36:40,000
evolution of these ideas with new

3143
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:41,840
technology and so

3144
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:43,600
uh it's easy to get caught up in the

3145
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:44,560
technology but when you really zoom out

3146
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,560
and look at it from the

3147
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:48,239
ideological standpoint and kind of the

3148
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:49,760
the progress of humanity

3149
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:51,678
it's a foregone conclusion this stuff's

3150
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:53,360
going to happen it's just how

3151
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:55,600
i think the world is waiting and some of

3152
01:36:53,359 --> 01:36:57,519
us are trying to create

3153
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:59,360
that future world which is like what are

3154
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:00,960
the applications of this technology that

3155
01:36:59,359 --> 01:37:03,599
will transform the world

3156
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:05,118
and then you know i hate the term but

3157
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:07,920
killer apps like

3158
01:37:05,118 --> 01:37:09,759
cool ideas that are implemented

3159
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:11,520
effectively at scale to transform the

3160
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:13,520
world there's been

3161
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,719
there's been a lot of different ideas

3162
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,480
popping up

3163
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:18,399
like the there's a lot of ideas about

3164
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:19,678
social networks that are built on top of

3165
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:20,559
the technology and all that kind of

3166
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:23,039
stuff

3167
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:24,560
so but let me actually uh drag us back

3168
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:29,118
down to something basic

3169
01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:33,920
if a person wanted to buy bitcoin

3170
01:37:29,118 --> 01:37:34,639
store bitcoin how do they actually do it

3171
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:36,399
yeah

3172
01:37:34,639 --> 01:37:38,480
so there's a couple of different ways to

3173
01:37:36,399 --> 01:37:41,118
kind of uh acquire bitcoin

3174
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:42,399
and in every way you've got to exchange

3175
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:44,479
some form of value

3176
01:37:42,399 --> 01:37:45,920
for bitcoin right which is part of why

3177
01:37:44,479 --> 01:37:46,479
it has values because you're giving up

3178
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:50,800
value

3179
01:37:46,479 --> 01:37:54,079
so um in one way is to exchange

3180
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:56,239
uh energy and computational power

3181
01:37:54,079 --> 01:37:57,118
for bitcoin so you can mine it you can

3182
01:37:56,238 --> 01:37:59,359
literally take

3183
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:01,118
uh computer power that you have you can

3184
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:03,118
rent it to the network

3185
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:04,158
uh and run that software and then it

3186
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:07,039
will pay you

3187
01:38:04,158 --> 01:38:08,479
a portion of the kind of daily revenue

3188
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:10,000
uh off that system

3189
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:12,559
you can acquire bitcoin in exchange for

3190
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,319
your power uh and your computational

3191
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:16,000
um kind of contribution and that's the

3192
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:18,719
fundamental principle behind bitcoin

3193
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,679
is the proof of work so i got a hundred

3194
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:23,198
bucks

3195
01:38:19,679 --> 01:38:25,359
uh like i use cash app uh

3196
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:27,198
you know they uh there's coinbase

3197
01:38:25,359 --> 01:38:30,399
there's all these exchanges

3198
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:33,678
like how do i convert my hundred dollars

3199
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:36,399
to uh to bitcoin is there something

3200
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:37,600
disclaimer this is not financial advice

3201
01:38:36,399 --> 01:38:40,079
and this is just us

3202
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:41,520
uh talking is just your opinions just do

3203
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:45,760
not use this to invest

3204
01:38:41,520 --> 01:38:48,719
um or take us financial expertise

3205
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:50,880
that said uh like uh is there something

3206
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:51,679
you recommend that's an easy entry point

3207
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,840
for somebody

3208
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:56,158
that's like hmm i wonder if i can

3209
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:58,000
convert this hundred dollars into

3210
01:38:56,158 --> 01:38:59,679
whatever amount of bitcoin what do you

3211
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,679
recommend what are the options

3212
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:03,199
so there's a lot of options uh i'm

3213
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:04,880
heavily biased i went out and i

3214
01:39:03,198 --> 01:39:05,839
scoured the market looked at all of them

3215
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:06,960
i've invested a lot of money in a

3216
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:08,800
company called block fi

3217
01:39:06,960 --> 01:39:10,560
that basically um basically has

3218
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,000
financial products for crypto investors

3219
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:14,159
so you can go you can take

3220
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,000
dollars or other currency you have you

3221
01:39:14,158 --> 01:39:18,399
can convert it through an exchange

3222
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:19,679
uh you can leave it on these interest

3223
01:39:18,399 --> 01:39:20,799
bearing accounts you can earn interest

3224
01:39:19,679 --> 01:39:22,000
just like you would earn in a

3225
01:39:20,800 --> 01:39:23,279
traditional account but

3226
01:39:22,000 --> 01:39:26,000
higher levels of interest because it's

3227
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:28,238
this new thing or you can withdraw

3228
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:29,840
it and you can put it into cold storage

3229
01:39:28,238 --> 01:39:30,879
on a hardware device you can leave it in

3230
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,239
a software wall there's kind of all

3231
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:33,840
these storage options

3232
01:39:32,238 --> 01:39:35,279
uh so block file is you know kind of the

3233
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:37,199
one that i'm biased towards because

3234
01:39:35,279 --> 01:39:38,319
so block files or sorry to interrupt uh

3235
01:39:37,198 --> 01:39:41,519
so the block fi

3236
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:42,238
is is uh bitcoin only or is it an

3237
01:39:41,520 --> 01:39:43,199
exchange with the

3238
01:39:42,238 --> 01:39:44,718
other crypto it's got a bunch of

3239
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:45,439
different ones yeah they basically are

3240
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:48,480
agnostic

3241
01:39:45,439 --> 01:39:49,519
to what it is um but they provide uh

3242
01:39:48,479 --> 01:39:51,519
kind of financial

3243
01:39:49,520 --> 01:39:53,280
you know products to crypto investors

3244
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,800
okay so you mentioned a few

3245
01:39:53,279 --> 01:39:56,960
interesting ideas that'd be nice for

3246
01:39:54,800 --> 01:40:00,079
people who would not be familiar

3247
01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:01,679
with it uh cold storage hot storage uh

3248
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:04,639
what does that mean so like

3249
01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:06,079
i go to a website and i convert dollars

3250
01:40:04,639 --> 01:40:08,079
to bitcoin

3251
01:40:06,079 --> 01:40:09,679
that's the kind of storage that's like

3252
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:12,960
online banking

3253
01:40:09,679 --> 01:40:14,319
right what else is there

3254
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:15,840
so there's a couple of different things

3255
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:18,238
that you can do right and let's use the

3256
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:22,079
legacy system as kind of an example so

3257
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:24,319
if i want to um get currency

3258
01:40:22,079 --> 01:40:26,639
and i put in my bank account it sits

3259
01:40:24,319 --> 01:40:29,439
there i have to trust that the bank

3260
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:31,039
doesn't go under nobody steals it all

3261
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:31,439
this kind of stuff there's insurance for

3262
01:40:31,039 --> 01:40:32,639
it right

3263
01:40:31,439 --> 01:40:34,638
there's all these kind of benefits in

3264
01:40:32,639 --> 01:40:35,600
the legacy system to make sure that as

3265
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:36,880
long as i don't have

3266
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:38,320
millions and millions of dollars there

3267
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,440
i'm going to be protected pretty much if

3268
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:42,559
anything happens

3269
01:40:39,439 --> 01:40:44,399
through fdic insurance if

3270
01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:45,679
i want to do that i'm taking that

3271
01:40:44,399 --> 01:40:46,879
counterparty risk though

3272
01:40:45,679 --> 01:40:48,480
so it's mitigated but there's still

3273
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:49,039
counterparty risk i'm counting on that

3274
01:40:48,479 --> 01:40:50,718
bank

3275
01:40:49,039 --> 01:40:51,760
but it is easier to move it around right

3276
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:53,279
if all of a sudden you call me up and

3277
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:54,560
say hey send me some money i can press a

3278
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:56,960
couple buttons on my computer

3279
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:58,560
and it'll send it to you if i want

3280
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,639
deeper level of security

3281
01:40:58,560 --> 01:41:02,719
i can go and i can get the physical

3282
01:41:00,639 --> 01:41:04,960
dollars and i can go and i can

3283
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:06,239
you know put under my mattress right and

3284
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,760
i can say you know what

3285
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:09,759
it's not gonna be as easy to send it to

3286
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:10,400
you immediately but if i really want to

3287
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,840
i can go

3288
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:13,439
underneath my mattress pretty quickly i

3289
01:41:11,840 --> 01:41:15,760
can grab it i can get it back to the

3290
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:16,879
bank and then i can send you the money

3291
01:41:15,760 --> 01:41:18,320
the third thing i could do is i could

3292
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,840
basically take those physical dollars

3293
01:41:18,319 --> 01:41:21,279
out of the bank and i could go and i

3294
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:23,119
could go put it literally

3295
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:24,960
uh you know in a vault somewhere that i

3296
01:41:23,118 --> 01:41:25,839
don't have control over that's behind 10

3297
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:27,840
passwords

3298
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:29,360
uh and biometric scanning and like it's

3299
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,079
really difficult to even get to it yeah

3300
01:41:29,359 --> 01:41:31,359
right

3301
01:41:30,079 --> 01:41:33,519
so if you almost look at it as like

3302
01:41:31,359 --> 01:41:35,118
there's three stages of security that

3303
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:36,880
you could have in the traditional world

3304
01:41:35,118 --> 01:41:38,479
the same thing is true in bitcoin so you

3305
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,679
could buy bitcoin on any exchange you

3306
01:41:38,479 --> 01:41:41,678
could do it on wi-fi but you also can do

3307
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:44,960
it on places like coinbase gemini

3308
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:47,600
kraken etc also cash app

3309
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,158
cash app you can do that i think i i

3310
01:41:47,600 --> 01:41:50,960
think there's

3311
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:52,079
still sponsoring this podcast i'm not

3312
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:54,880
biased at all

3313
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:55,760
so once you get bitcoin on any of these

3314
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,800
uh venues

3315
01:41:55,760 --> 01:42:01,520
uh you can leave it there on that venue

3316
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:03,440
now the trade-off is you're taking

3317
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:05,040
counterparty risk so somebody else

3318
01:42:03,439 --> 01:42:06,559
is responsible for the security and the

3319
01:42:05,039 --> 01:42:09,039
protection of it uh

3320
01:42:06,560 --> 01:42:10,000
in many cases big well-known companies

3321
01:42:09,039 --> 01:42:11,118
who have billions and billions of

3322
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:12,479
dollars of assets

3323
01:42:11,118 --> 01:42:13,839
they have higher levels of security

3324
01:42:12,479 --> 01:42:15,118
that's why they're well known that's why

3325
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:17,199
people trust them whatever but you are

3326
01:42:15,118 --> 01:42:19,279
taking counterparty risk

3327
01:42:17,198 --> 01:42:21,039
it is easier to quickly send to somebody

3328
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:21,679
so this so the trade-off of like ease of

3329
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:23,519
use

3330
01:42:21,679 --> 01:42:25,118
uh but counterparty risk is big and in

3331
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:27,760
the bitcoin community specifically

3332
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:28,799
this is a huge thing of uh they really

3333
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,880
really have a cape for

3334
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:32,639
not leaving the bitcoin there right for

3335
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,000
the obvious counter priority

3336
01:42:32,639 --> 01:42:36,560
the second thing you can do is you can

3337
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,679
basically get it off of an exchange and

3338
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,039
you can put it in

3339
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:41,039
some level of kind of what i'll call a

3340
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:42,000
second layer of storage that second

3341
01:42:41,039 --> 01:42:43,679
layer storage could be

3342
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,039
a hardware device that you can quickly

3343
01:42:43,679 --> 01:42:46,719
just you know grab off your desk and

3344
01:42:45,039 --> 01:42:47,840
plug into your computer and immediately

3345
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:48,399
use that's what they call like a

3346
01:42:47,840 --> 01:42:50,319
hardware

3347
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:51,839
hardware wallet yep or you can have some

3348
01:42:50,319 --> 01:42:52,319
sort of software wallet right where it's

3349
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:54,560
not on

3350
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:56,238
an exchange but there is some level of

3351
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:58,239
uh in between between the hardware

3352
01:42:56,238 --> 01:42:59,678
wallet and the exchange in this software

3353
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:01,279
wallet but the software wallet is

3354
01:42:59,679 --> 01:43:03,520
connected to the internet yeah

3355
01:43:01,279 --> 01:43:04,639
and so um if you kind of think of it as

3356
01:43:03,520 --> 01:43:06,800
like the exchange

3357
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:08,400
software wallet hardware wallet and then

3358
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:10,880
there's something called deep storage

3359
01:43:08,399 --> 01:43:12,399
right or cold storage um and this is you

3360
01:43:10,880 --> 01:43:15,520
know literally there was a

3361
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:17,359
a company uh called zappo that uh would

3362
01:43:15,520 --> 01:43:19,119
put things in deep cold storage

3363
01:43:17,359 --> 01:43:20,399
and it was literally buried in a

3364
01:43:19,118 --> 01:43:22,639
mountain

3365
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:24,238
right so like the odds that somebody's

3366
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:25,840
physically gonna go there there's armed

3367
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:26,879
guards there's you know kind of all this

3368
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,159
type of stuff

3369
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:29,840
but again you're taking some level of

3370
01:43:28,158 --> 01:43:30,559
counterparty risk because they have your

3371
01:43:29,840 --> 01:43:33,600
bitcoin

3372
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:37,039
and so the saying or the phrase uh is

3373
01:43:33,600 --> 01:43:38,639
not your keys not your coins uh whereas

3374
01:43:37,039 --> 01:43:40,079
my buddy isaiah jackson came up with

3375
01:43:38,639 --> 01:43:42,400
these said uh uh

3376
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:43,519
not your keys not your cheese right in

3377
01:43:42,399 --> 01:43:46,000
terms of uh

3378
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:47,199
uh sovereignty is important right and

3379
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:48,238
ultimately this goes back to

3380
01:43:47,198 --> 01:43:50,479
kind of the beginning of a conversation

3381
01:43:48,238 --> 01:43:52,799
around bitcoin's ethos

3382
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:54,879
sovereignty right giving the power back

3383
01:43:52,800 --> 01:43:57,039
to people you don't have to rely on

3384
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:58,880
uh this infrastructure in order to be

3385
01:43:57,039 --> 01:44:00,880
able to participate in this monetary

3386
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,400
uh kind of economy which you are now

3387
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:04,400
able to do is you're able to

3388
01:44:02,399 --> 01:44:05,519
use digital sound money you're able to

3389
01:44:04,399 --> 01:44:07,679
keep control of it

3390
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:09,760
you and you alone are responsible for it

3391
01:44:07,679 --> 01:44:11,920
so the idea of personal responsibility

3392
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:13,039
um and then also you and you alone make

3393
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,679
the decisions as to

3394
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:17,439
whether you hold on to it or you use it

3395
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:18,800
without censorship right no one can tell

3396
01:44:17,439 --> 01:44:20,158
you what you can do with it or can't do

3397
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:23,760
with it and so

3398
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:26,799
the purchase and the storage what i find

3399
01:44:23,760 --> 01:44:30,560
is uh depending on who you are there's

3400
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:32,560
varying uh degrees of kind of concern

3401
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,880
or decisions that get made there a lot

3402
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:36,560
of it comes down to personal preference

3403
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:38,480
the bitcoin community though absolutely

3404
01:44:36,560 --> 01:44:41,199
will over optimize for

3405
01:44:38,479 --> 01:44:42,238
uh sovereignty and uh kind of hardware

3406
01:44:41,198 --> 01:44:43,839
or cold storage

3407
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:47,279
i wonder if you can sort of comment on

3408
01:44:43,840 --> 01:44:50,480
that because you you have uh

3409
01:44:47,279 --> 01:44:51,439
uh sort of uh cash app and block fi and

3410
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:54,959
coinbase

3411
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:56,559
like you can store it that you can

3412
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:58,880
purchase and trade it there and store it

3413
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,600
there and so on but ultimately they're

3414
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,440
saying

3415
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,880
you want to you know keep some of it

3416
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:03,519
there but you want to move it to the

3417
01:45:02,880 --> 01:45:06,319
hardware

3418
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:07,280
wallet and the cold storage of the

3419
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:08,880
hardware wallet

3420
01:45:07,279 --> 01:45:10,800
is like you can disconnect it from the

3421
01:45:08,880 --> 01:45:12,880
computer because ultimately stuff that's

3422
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:15,600
connected to the internet

3423
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:18,079
can be compromised can be controlled by

3424
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:20,239
governments and other parties and so on

3425
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:22,479
what are your thoughts about sort of

3426
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:25,919
practically speaking for

3427
01:45:22,479 --> 01:45:27,759
maybe like a regular citizen what's

3428
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:29,118
what should be the role of the hardware

3429
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:30,960
wallet in their lives

3430
01:45:29,118 --> 01:45:32,559
yeah so at the highest level i just

3431
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,118
think that like learning about it is

3432
01:45:32,560 --> 01:45:34,400
important

3433
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:36,719
right so even if you only have five

3434
01:45:34,399 --> 01:45:38,559
dollars equivalent of bitcoin

3435
01:45:36,719 --> 01:45:39,920
going and understanding here's how it

3436
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,760
works here's why it's important

3437
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:43,440
here's how i would actually withdraw

3438
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:44,560
from an exchange under the hardware wall

3439
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:46,479
like that alone

3440
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:47,840
just as an intellectual exercise is a

3441
01:45:46,479 --> 01:45:48,479
worthwhile pursuit i think people should

3442
01:45:47,840 --> 01:45:49,760
go do that

3443
01:45:48,479 --> 01:45:51,519
and actually go through the process of

3444
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,440
the steps so you feel like you can

3445
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:54,719
you can do it yeah yeah it's kind of

3446
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:56,079
like if i said to you you know hey we're

3447
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:57,279
gonna go buy an asset

3448
01:45:56,079 --> 01:45:58,800
and you never went and you looked at it

3449
01:45:57,279 --> 01:45:59,599
you never went and uh you know made a

3450
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,520
decision like

3451
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:03,199
sure maybe i did it or i didn't do it

3452
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,320
but like you didn't actually experience

3453
01:46:03,198 --> 01:46:05,279
it right and so i think that that's the

3454
01:46:04,319 --> 01:46:07,599
important part

3455
01:46:05,279 --> 01:46:09,118
the second thing is uh each person is

3456
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:10,719
different from a

3457
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:12,238
how they view this asset so there are

3458
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:13,520
some people who are speculating right

3459
01:46:12,238 --> 01:46:15,039
there's three use cases for bitcoin

3460
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,400
there's store value medium of exchange

3461
01:46:15,039 --> 01:46:17,840
and speculation

3462
01:46:16,399 --> 01:46:19,519
and the people who are speculating they

3463
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:21,199
can't put it in deep cold storage

3464
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:23,679
because they need to be able to trade it

3465
01:46:21,198 --> 01:46:24,960
right so what ends up happening is they

3466
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:26,239
fall in the bucket of like high risk

3467
01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,000
high reward

3468
01:46:26,238 --> 01:46:29,519
they're trying to trade they're trying

3469
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,880
to do all these things and sure maybe

3470
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,840
there are profits that they can generate

3471
01:46:30,880 --> 01:46:33,600
if they're good at it

3472
01:46:31,840 --> 01:46:35,520
but also they're introducing a lot of

3473
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,719
risk and so that person is very

3474
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,159
different than the person who says hey

3475
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:38,480
you know i bought one bitcoin and i'm

3476
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:40,399
gonna

3477
01:46:38,479 --> 01:46:41,839
save it for my child right and i'm gonna

3478
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:43,599
give it to them on their 18th birthday

3479
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:46,079
yeah and so when you start to look at

3480
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:48,400
this what you end up saying is

3481
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:50,238
what are you actually purchasing this

3482
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:52,799
for kind of like why are you doing it

3483
01:46:50,238 --> 01:46:54,479
and then what's your time horizon and

3484
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,840
what ends up happening is

3485
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:57,678
more and more people in the bitcoin

3486
01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,279
community have longer time horizons one

3487
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:01,039
of the advantages to

3488
01:46:59,279 --> 01:47:02,800
uh this community right if you look at

3489
01:47:01,039 --> 01:47:05,039
the on-chain metrics 60

3490
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,560
of bitcoin haven't moved uh from the

3491
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:08,719
digital wallet in which they sit

3492
01:47:06,560 --> 01:47:10,560
in the last 12 months so even though

3493
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:12,158
it's appreciated hundreds of percent

3494
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,639
on the upside there's been lots of

3495
01:47:12,158 --> 01:47:16,960
volatility a 50 drop in a single day

3496
01:47:14,639 --> 01:47:18,159
in terms of the us dollar price still

3497
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,439
doesn't move and so these are

3498
01:47:18,158 --> 01:47:21,439
kind of the long-term holders right

3499
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:22,960
these are the the iron fists or

3500
01:47:21,439 --> 01:47:25,039
as recently as it's become popular the

3501
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:26,800
diamond hands right

3502
01:47:25,039 --> 01:47:28,960
hands they're just they're not going

3503
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:31,920
anywhere and so i think that

3504
01:47:28,960 --> 01:47:33,039
those people are much more likely to not

3505
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:35,279
have their bitcoin

3506
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:36,639
on exchanges or in software walls

3507
01:47:35,279 --> 01:47:37,679
they've got it in some sort of like

3508
01:47:36,639 --> 01:47:40,159
highly secure

3509
01:47:37,679 --> 01:47:40,719
environment uh and what and one in which

3510
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:43,839
they have

3511
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:44,800
deep sovereignty or kind of prevalent

3512
01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:46,639
sovereignty

3513
01:47:44,800 --> 01:47:48,320
and the reason for that is because they

3514
01:47:46,639 --> 01:47:49,359
have that long time horizon they don't

3515
01:47:48,319 --> 01:47:52,719
want to be

3516
01:47:49,359 --> 01:47:55,599
um kind of convicted around bitcoin

3517
01:47:52,719 --> 01:47:56,880
sound money macro environment all stuff

3518
01:47:55,600 --> 01:47:57,840
and then they make a mistake because

3519
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,639
they trusted

3520
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:02,000
you know abcd company uh and that

3521
01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:02,800
counterparty risk because it ends up

3522
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,198
actually being

3523
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:06,400
you know fatal or or detrimental so

3524
01:48:05,198 --> 01:48:09,759
again this is

3525
01:48:06,399 --> 01:48:12,879
not financial advice disclaimer but

3526
01:48:09,760 --> 01:48:15,119
uh let me ask so you in terms of

3527
01:48:12,880 --> 01:48:17,118
investment advice on bitcoin

3528
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:18,238
so you see bitcoins potentially not just

3529
01:48:17,118 --> 01:48:20,639
the thing that you sp

3530
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:21,919
speculate over like buy and sell buy and

3531
01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:23,920
sell buy and sell

3532
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:25,760
but it's something that you can just buy

3533
01:48:23,920 --> 01:48:27,920
only and i believe

3534
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,880
i've heard that you own uh quite a large

3535
01:48:27,920 --> 01:48:31,520
percentage of you

3536
01:48:28,880 --> 01:48:32,079
of your wealth in in bitcoin and you're

3537
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:34,800
basically

3538
01:48:32,079 --> 01:48:37,118
buying only yeah and storing long term

3539
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:39,039
so that's something that's a legitimate

3540
01:48:37,118 --> 01:48:40,158
way to approach bitcoin in your

3541
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:42,319
recommendation

3542
01:48:40,158 --> 01:48:44,319
go to other cultures so if we remove

3543
01:48:42,319 --> 01:48:46,639
ourselves from the western world culture

3544
01:48:44,319 --> 01:48:48,079
of uh investing in gamification of

3545
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:49,679
financial markets and the

3546
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:51,760
financialization of everything

3547
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:53,118
let's say we go to uh the culture of

3548
01:48:51,760 --> 01:48:55,440
india

3549
01:48:53,118 --> 01:48:56,960
for hundreds if not thousands of years

3550
01:48:55,439 --> 01:48:59,439
families basically

3551
01:48:56,960 --> 01:49:00,158
saved their wealth in gold and in

3552
01:48:59,439 --> 01:49:02,559
jewelry

3553
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:04,000
and in these hard assets with the

3554
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,639
expectation

3555
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:07,118
to pass it on to the next generation and

3556
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:09,840
so

3557
01:49:07,118 --> 01:49:10,880
it would be blasphemous to sell the

3558
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:12,960
family's gold

3559
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:14,000
in that culture right you know your

3560
01:49:12,960 --> 01:49:15,198
great grandfather gave it to your

3561
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:16,719
grandfather your grandfather gave it to

3562
01:49:15,198 --> 01:49:20,319
your father your father gave it to you

3563
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:23,599
right and so in that culture

3564
01:49:20,319 --> 01:49:27,439
the long-term kind of uh holding

3565
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:29,679
is the default i think that what bitcoin

3566
01:49:27,439 --> 01:49:30,638
has presented again is a digital

3567
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:32,960
application

3568
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:34,319
of the exact same thing which is that

3569
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:37,039
while everything else in the world is

3570
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:39,519
being devalued that is denominated in a

3571
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:40,319
uh a currency that is being inflated

3572
01:49:39,520 --> 01:49:43,599
away

3573
01:49:40,319 --> 01:49:45,439
whether it's quickly or not this finite

3574
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:47,279
supply this scarce asset ends up

3575
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:48,079
accruing more and more value over time

3576
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:51,118
right

3577
01:49:48,079 --> 01:49:54,000
and so um i think that for me personally

3578
01:49:51,118 --> 01:49:55,679
um i've got you know over 95 of my net

3579
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:59,279
worth that's in this

3580
01:49:55,679 --> 01:50:01,920
90 over 95 percent of your net worth

3581
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:02,559
there's two important caveats to this

3582
01:50:01,920 --> 01:50:05,639
one

3583
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:07,360
is i didn't you know buy some bitcoin in

3584
01:50:05,639 --> 01:50:08,960
2011 or 12

3585
01:50:07,359 --> 01:50:10,960
right and then also it appreciated a

3586
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:12,719
bunch and it grew into that but

3587
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:14,000
from a cost basis perspective you know i

3588
01:50:12,719 --> 01:50:17,118
put 100 and now it's

3589
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:19,198
a ton of money instead what i did was i

3590
01:50:17,118 --> 01:50:22,158
basically in 2018

3591
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:23,519
um saw bitcoin from a us dollar price

3592
01:50:22,158 --> 01:50:24,238
standpoint was falling and falling and

3593
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:25,840
falling

3594
01:50:24,238 --> 01:50:27,678
and in december of 2018 it said take

3595
01:50:25,840 --> 01:50:30,400
about 50 of my net worth

3596
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:31,920
and convert it from dollar denominated

3597
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:33,439
assets into bitcoin so it was a very

3598
01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:34,960
kind of intentional decision with a very

3599
01:50:33,439 --> 01:50:36,719
specific view on the world as to like

3600
01:50:34,960 --> 01:50:39,039
why i was doing it

3601
01:50:36,719 --> 01:50:40,319
i then essentially just let it sit there

3602
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:43,599
grow whatever

3603
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:45,198
until uh the spring of 2020.

3604
01:50:43,599 --> 01:50:47,599
and when i saw the government step in

3605
01:50:45,198 --> 01:50:49,039
and start to say hey we're going to

3606
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:50,159
really be aggressive in terms of

3607
01:50:49,039 --> 01:50:51,279
interest rate manipulation and

3608
01:50:50,158 --> 01:50:52,799
quantitative easing

3609
01:50:51,279 --> 01:50:54,319
i then decided to go ahead and take

3610
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:56,000
basically the remainder

3611
01:50:54,319 --> 01:50:57,920
and start to convert it as well so i

3612
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:00,479
became very aggressive in doing that

3613
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:02,319
and so the way that i look at it is

3614
01:51:00,479 --> 01:51:04,559
that's actually my savings

3615
01:51:02,319 --> 01:51:05,920
right and so in some weird way if i said

3616
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:06,639
to you know what's the dollar worth

3617
01:51:05,920 --> 01:51:08,639
you'd say well

3618
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:11,199
a one dollar bill's worth one dollar

3619
01:51:08,639 --> 01:51:12,319
right bitcoin to me i denominate my

3620
01:51:11,198 --> 01:51:14,479
wealth in bitcoin

3621
01:51:12,319 --> 01:51:16,158
so i think of one bitcoin is worth one

3622
01:51:14,479 --> 01:51:17,359
bitcoin not one bitcoin is worth sixty

3623
01:51:16,158 --> 01:51:18,799
thousand or fifty five thousand or

3624
01:51:17,359 --> 01:51:20,000
seventy thousand right i denominate

3625
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:20,480
everything in bitcoin when i make a

3626
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,560
purchase

3627
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:24,319
in my head i'm calculating how much

3628
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,400
bitcoin am i spending right now

3629
01:51:24,319 --> 01:51:28,399
right well guess what happens when you

3630
01:51:26,399 --> 01:51:30,399
have a devaluing currency as the

3631
01:51:28,399 --> 01:51:31,759
denominator

3632
01:51:30,399 --> 01:51:33,359
doesn't matter right like you're

3633
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:35,119
financially incentivized to spend or

3634
01:51:33,359 --> 01:51:38,079
invest right to consume

3635
01:51:35,118 --> 01:51:39,118
uh when you have an appreciating

3636
01:51:38,079 --> 01:51:41,039
currency

3637
01:51:39,118 --> 01:51:43,198
all of a sudden you become much less

3638
01:51:41,039 --> 01:51:46,560
consumptive

3639
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:49,598
yeah because you're actually trading off

3640
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,639
future purchasing power yeah for the

3641
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:54,159
consumption today

3642
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:56,639
it's fascinating to think that if if uh

3643
01:51:54,158 --> 01:51:57,679
when you move about this world you think

3644
01:51:56,639 --> 01:52:00,159
in bitcoin

3645
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:01,599
you behave differently is if you think

3646
01:52:00,158 --> 01:52:05,118
in dollars

3647
01:52:01,599 --> 01:52:06,079
that's really fascinating people but but

3648
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:08,079
here's the thing is

3649
01:52:06,079 --> 01:52:10,960
the last 50 years or so is actually the

3650
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:13,920
outlier in history

3651
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:14,960
most people used to think this way yeah

3652
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:18,000
it's only when

3653
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:19,920
a fiat currency got introduced that

3654
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:22,399
one argument the positive argument or

3655
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:23,920
perspective is there was an explosion in

3656
01:52:22,399 --> 01:52:24,960
growth

3657
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:26,960
but really it's because there was a

3658
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:29,198
financial incentive to consume yeah

3659
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:30,480
right and there's nobody better in the

3660
01:52:29,198 --> 01:52:32,879
world than the united states

3661
01:52:30,479 --> 01:52:33,678
at consuming and we consume anything and

3662
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,440
everything

3663
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:37,599
and if you want to see a great example

3664
01:52:35,439 --> 01:52:38,238
look at how big the coca-colas are at

3665
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:39,840
mcdonald's

3666
01:52:38,238 --> 01:52:41,359
right you know you go to other places

3667
01:52:39,840 --> 01:52:44,960
they don't serve them that big

3668
01:52:41,359 --> 01:52:46,000
and so the other example or the negative

3669
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:49,439
argument

3670
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:51,599
is we have to consume

3671
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:53,519
because if not you end up being the

3672
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:55,440
bottom 45 percent of americans that held

3673
01:52:53,520 --> 01:52:56,639
no investable assets

3674
01:52:55,439 --> 01:52:58,638
and actually are just having their

3675
01:52:56,639 --> 01:52:59,359
wealth devalued away so holding the

3676
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:01,679
dollars

3677
01:52:59,359 --> 01:53:02,799
end up being a very bad economic

3678
01:53:01,679 --> 01:53:04,639
decision

3679
01:53:02,800 --> 01:53:06,159
and so when you then switch to this

3680
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:08,639
sound money

3681
01:53:06,158 --> 01:53:10,479
you say wait a second why would i if

3682
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:12,480
today i can trade one bitcoin

3683
01:53:10,479 --> 01:53:13,598
you know back in october of last year

3684
01:53:12,479 --> 01:53:17,198
one bitcoin for 10

3685
01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:19,440
000 us dollars why would i spend that if

3686
01:53:17,198 --> 01:53:21,519
at some point in the future whether it's

3687
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:23,519
a month from now or 10 years from now

3688
01:53:21,520 --> 01:53:25,119
i could trade it for something much more

3689
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:28,480
than that

3690
01:53:25,118 --> 01:53:31,039
you just become much more of a um

3691
01:53:28,479 --> 01:53:31,678
uh anti-consumer and much more of a

3692
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:32,960
long-term

3693
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:34,319
thinker yeah from the individual

3694
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:34,800
perspective that's pretty powerful i

3695
01:53:34,319 --> 01:53:36,479
wonder

3696
01:53:34,800 --> 01:53:38,880
i mean i think that's an interesting

3697
01:53:36,479 --> 01:53:40,319
debate what's better for the long-term

3698
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:43,039
economy no

3699
01:53:40,319 --> 01:53:44,399
uh better for the growth of the

3700
01:53:43,039 --> 01:53:47,840
civilization

3701
01:53:44,399 --> 01:53:51,279
because capitalism is fascinating uh

3702
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:54,319
it seems to it seems to work pretty well

3703
01:53:51,279 --> 01:53:57,920
there's this kind of like eric weinstein

3704
01:53:54,319 --> 01:54:00,639
says that one of the problems is

3705
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:01,840
for the past several decades this whole

3706
01:54:00,639 --> 01:54:03,679
economy

3707
01:54:01,840 --> 01:54:05,039
society is built on the idea that we

3708
01:54:03,679 --> 01:54:08,079
have to keep growing

3709
01:54:05,039 --> 01:54:10,479
like it depends on that idea and it's a

3710
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:13,599
good question whether that's going to

3711
01:54:10,479 --> 01:54:16,799
result in huge problems or if like a

3712
01:54:13,599 --> 01:54:19,920
college student on a deadline

3713
01:54:16,800 --> 01:54:21,760
the the dependence on growth will mean

3714
01:54:19,920 --> 01:54:24,639
that we'll have to grow

3715
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:25,119
like the fear of death will force us to

3716
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:26,880
grow

3717
01:54:25,118 --> 01:54:28,479
but i think there's a false equivalency

3718
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:30,639
between um

3719
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:32,158
we're dependent on growth and then if

3720
01:54:30,639 --> 01:54:32,639
the world was denominated and sound

3721
01:54:32,158 --> 01:54:34,960
money

3722
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:36,400
we don't grow what i think ends up

3723
01:54:34,960 --> 01:54:37,920
happening is

3724
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:39,439
we remove a lot of the society's

3725
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:42,158
[ __ ] yeah

3726
01:54:39,439 --> 01:54:42,559
because right now when the money is free

3727
01:54:42,158 --> 01:54:44,638
or

3728
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:46,080
the currency is free you can come up

3729
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:46,960
with all kinds of crazy stuff and people

3730
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:50,000
will give it to you

3731
01:54:46,960 --> 01:54:53,039
right when all of a sudden it's really

3732
01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:54,238
really valued by the population the

3733
01:54:53,039 --> 01:54:56,960
decisions are better

3734
01:54:54,238 --> 01:54:58,638
yeah you have to provide real value in

3735
01:54:56,960 --> 01:54:59,920
the goods and services you provide

3736
01:54:58,639 --> 01:55:01,760
to get them to give it to you there's

3737
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:03,118
less room for corruption less room for

3738
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:05,440
manipulation that's

3739
01:55:03,118 --> 01:55:06,479
and like that's not actually productive

3740
01:55:05,439 --> 01:55:09,678
yeah uh

3741
01:55:06,479 --> 01:55:10,319
definitely so you said you moved a lot

3742
01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:13,199
of

3743
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:13,599
your investment into bitcoin and is

3744
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:17,439
there

3745
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:20,319
uh when you look so you're a special

3746
01:55:17,439 --> 01:55:22,158
human being in many ways uh so you're

3747
01:55:20,319 --> 01:55:23,519
like a strategic thinker but you're also

3748
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:23,920
like a deep thinker about this whole

3749
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:26,000
thing

3750
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:28,079
but when you look at a regular club like

3751
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:31,279
me uh in terms of just

3752
01:55:28,079 --> 01:55:32,479
investing and moving into uh thinking

3753
01:55:31,279 --> 01:55:34,800
about cryptocurrency

3754
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:36,399
is there a strategy that you recommend

3755
01:55:34,800 --> 01:55:37,360
what are the different options about

3756
01:55:36,399 --> 01:55:39,118
investing

3757
01:55:37,359 --> 01:55:41,039
into bitcoin yeah so i think that

3758
01:55:39,118 --> 01:55:43,519
there's just uh kind of

3759
01:55:41,039 --> 01:55:45,599
timeless advice when it comes to uh

3760
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:46,000
investing or acquiring an asset in

3761
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:48,239
general

3762
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,439
uh dollar cost averaging is usually the

3763
01:55:48,238 --> 01:55:50,158
the best way to think about it and what

3764
01:55:49,439 --> 01:55:53,678
i mean by that

3765
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:54,158
is um most people don't just have a pile

3766
01:55:53,679 --> 01:55:55,760
of

3767
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:57,039
uh currency sitting there right it's not

3768
01:55:55,760 --> 01:55:58,719
like they have a million dollars sitting

3769
01:55:57,039 --> 01:56:01,519
in their banks like what do i do with it

3770
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:02,399
uh that situation aside what happens is

3771
01:56:01,520 --> 01:56:05,440
they

3772
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:07,279
trade their hours and their effort for

3773
01:56:05,439 --> 01:56:08,559
currency and so as they get paid every

3774
01:56:07,279 --> 01:56:11,039
two weeks let's say

3775
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:12,719
um the best way to acquire bitcoin

3776
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:14,719
without having to worry about timing

3777
01:56:12,719 --> 01:56:16,000
markets and being a professional trader

3778
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:18,560
is to simply take whatever the

3779
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:20,319
percentage is that you want and to

3780
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,760
buy bitcoin when you get your paycheck

3781
01:56:20,319 --> 01:56:22,880
so if you get paid on the first and 15th

3782
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:24,800
of every month

3783
01:56:22,880 --> 01:56:25,840
on that day you should go take you know

3784
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,639
let's say it's three percent of your

3785
01:56:25,840 --> 01:56:28,319
paycheck

3786
01:56:26,639 --> 01:56:29,679
take three percent go buy bitcoin don't

3787
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:30,719
worry about what the price is just do

3788
01:56:29,679 --> 01:56:32,239
that over time

3789
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:35,198
and the reason why that's important is

3790
01:56:32,238 --> 01:56:36,399
um if in december of 2017 when bitcoin

3791
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:38,479
was at 20 000

3792
01:56:36,399 --> 01:56:40,079
it was the height of kind of this last

3793
01:56:38,479 --> 01:56:42,000
big upwards movement

3794
01:56:40,079 --> 01:56:43,599
you had taken all of your money and you

3795
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:45,198
had put it into bitcoin

3796
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:47,440
you would have had to wait almost three

3797
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:50,559
years just to get back to quote-unquote

3798
01:56:47,439 --> 01:56:51,598
break even in us dollar terms if at the

3799
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:54,880
same time

3800
01:56:51,599 --> 01:56:56,880
you had simply bought then and over the

3801
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:58,319
next three years bought every two weeks

3802
01:56:56,880 --> 01:57:00,800
you would have been up hundreds of

3803
01:56:58,319 --> 01:57:02,079
percent three years later

3804
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:03,599
because what ended up happening was you

3805
01:57:02,079 --> 01:57:04,079
bought a bunch of bitcoin when it was at

3806
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:07,119
15

3807
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:09,519
12 10 9 8 3 4

3808
01:57:07,118 --> 01:57:10,880
5 5 5 you know all the way back up on

3809
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:12,719
the other side

3810
01:57:10,880 --> 01:57:14,639
and so dollar cost averaging is one of

3811
01:57:12,719 --> 01:57:16,560
these weird things that uh it almost

3812
01:57:14,639 --> 01:57:19,118
sounds too easy

3813
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:21,360
but what we find is in america we have a

3814
01:57:19,118 --> 01:57:23,359
lack of financial education

3815
01:57:21,359 --> 01:57:24,799
and so rather than try to be smarter

3816
01:57:23,359 --> 01:57:26,158
than markets what most people are better

3817
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:27,599
off doing is just saying hey

3818
01:57:26,158 --> 01:57:29,759
set your what's called an asset

3819
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:32,480
allocation plan i want

3820
01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:33,599
30 in stocks i want 10 real estate i

3821
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:35,279
want this this whatever

3822
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:37,279
and every time you get your paycheck

3823
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:39,039
just think of it as a savings account

3824
01:57:37,279 --> 01:57:41,679
right just put it in based on those

3825
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:43,279
percentages and don't think about it

3826
01:57:41,679 --> 01:57:44,880
and over a long enough period of time

3827
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:46,559
what we find is

3828
01:57:44,880 --> 01:57:48,000
almost anyone in the united states right

3829
01:57:46,560 --> 01:57:48,880
there's exceptions but almost anyone in

3830
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,399
the united states

3831
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:52,719
can become a millionaire in their

3832
01:57:50,399 --> 01:57:54,079
lifetime if they follow these plans and

3833
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:55,840
have that long-term view and they allow

3834
01:57:54,079 --> 01:57:57,359
compounding to work for them

3835
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:59,039
and so don't look at the price of

3836
01:57:57,359 --> 01:57:59,920
bitcoin and all that kind of stuff just

3837
01:57:59,039 --> 01:58:03,039
pick a

3838
01:57:59,920 --> 01:58:04,319
specific time specific day that you just

3839
01:58:03,039 --> 01:58:05,920
buy

3840
01:58:04,319 --> 01:58:07,599
and you just keep buying that's probably

3841
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:09,039
good investment advice across any kind

3842
01:58:07,599 --> 01:58:10,400
of assets

3843
01:58:09,039 --> 01:58:11,679
it's like if you don't believe in

3844
01:58:10,399 --> 01:58:13,198
bitcoin and you just want to let's say

3845
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:14,719
you just want to do the s p 500

3846
01:58:13,198 --> 01:58:16,399
yeah you shouldn't try to time the

3847
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:17,039
market of the s p 500 either right you

3848
01:58:16,399 --> 01:58:18,319
should just

3849
01:58:17,039 --> 01:58:20,238
every two weeks you should just buy

3850
01:58:18,319 --> 01:58:21,679
something over a 20-year period

3851
01:58:20,238 --> 01:58:22,959
you're gonna end up buying it at all

3852
01:58:21,679 --> 01:58:24,719
kinds of different prices but you're

3853
01:58:22,960 --> 01:58:26,639
gonna get kind of a blended average

3854
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:28,399
and the more important thing is the

3855
01:58:26,639 --> 01:58:30,560
compounding and the time in the market

3856
01:58:28,399 --> 01:58:32,238
then did you buy it at you know two

3857
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:32,960
percent higher or lower than where you

3858
01:58:32,238 --> 01:58:34,799
bought it doesn't

3859
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:37,118
really matter and buying often makes you

3860
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:39,279
i guess uh resistant robust

3861
01:58:37,118 --> 01:58:41,118
to the uh to the volatility of the

3862
01:58:39,279 --> 01:58:42,319
market or the volatility the bitcoin

3863
01:58:41,118 --> 01:58:46,319
price and so on

3864
01:58:42,319 --> 01:58:49,920
that said uh you know bitcoin price

3865
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:53,599
is volatile and

3866
01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:56,960
you know again the argument i've heard

3867
01:58:53,599 --> 01:59:00,319
is like everything that's going to be

3868
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:02,319
a lot more valuable in the future

3869
01:59:00,319 --> 01:59:03,519
like if you look at the history like

3870
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:06,719
companies like apple

3871
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:08,639
like tesla's now i mean but

3872
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:10,480
you know let's look at companies that

3873
01:59:08,639 --> 01:59:12,960
have now stabilized right

3874
01:59:10,479 --> 01:59:14,879
uh apple is a good example it's like

3875
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:17,118
volatile in the beginning

3876
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,880
and so the argument for bitcoin is like

3877
01:59:17,118 --> 01:59:21,118
yeah this is the early stages because

3878
01:59:18,880 --> 01:59:23,199
it's going to be a lot more valuable

3879
01:59:21,118 --> 01:59:24,319
and right now it's volatile and this is

3880
01:59:23,198 --> 01:59:26,559
why you have to have these kinds of

3881
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:28,319
strategies to write out the volatility

3882
01:59:26,560 --> 01:59:29,679
of course everything that goes to zero

3883
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:32,960
is also volatile

3884
01:59:29,679 --> 01:59:35,118
like the early days are volatile uh

3885
01:59:32,960 --> 01:59:36,639
do you see like this volatility is like

3886
01:59:35,118 --> 01:59:39,118
a feature or a bug

3887
01:59:36,639 --> 01:59:40,400
or is this just like a way of life so

3888
01:59:39,118 --> 01:59:42,479
amazon is the one that i know the

3889
01:59:40,399 --> 01:59:44,799
numbers on in terms of early volatility

3890
01:59:42,479 --> 01:59:46,718
uh every year since they've gone it has

3891
01:59:44,800 --> 01:59:50,079
gone public it's had a double-digit

3892
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:52,560
drawdown in that year uh the average

3893
01:59:50,079 --> 01:59:55,198
is over 30 percent and one time it drew

3894
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:57,199
down over 95 percent

3895
01:59:55,198 --> 01:59:58,960
sounds a lot like bitcoin right like oh

3896
01:59:57,198 --> 02:00:00,238
wow this is crazy

3897
01:59:58,960 --> 02:00:01,760
but it's one of the best performing

3898
02:00:00,238 --> 02:00:03,359
stocks in the last 20 years if not the

3899
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:05,679
best performing stock

3900
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:06,799
and so volatility is not positive or

3901
02:00:05,679 --> 02:00:08,719
negative

3902
02:00:06,800 --> 02:00:10,159
it's positive or negative compared to

3903
02:00:08,719 --> 02:00:12,560
the position you're in

3904
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:13,359
so if you're long and it's volatile to

3905
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,840
the upside

3906
02:00:13,359 --> 02:00:17,359
it's positive if you're long holding

3907
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:18,000
something and it's volatile to the

3908
02:00:17,359 --> 02:00:19,439
downside

3909
02:00:18,000 --> 02:00:21,920
you see it as a negative it's all about

3910
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:25,039
perspective with that said

3911
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:28,158
um another way that i look at this is

3912
02:00:25,039 --> 02:00:32,000
every asset priced in bitcoin

3913
02:00:28,158 --> 02:00:35,039
is down significantly so over the last

3914
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:39,198
one three five years the dollar

3915
02:00:35,039 --> 02:00:41,679
priced in bitcoin has crashed 99

3916
02:00:39,198 --> 02:00:42,399
if you denominate stocks it's down like

3917
02:00:41,679 --> 02:00:44,800
80

3918
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:46,479
85 if you dominate gold if you

3919
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:48,880
denominate bonds if you just go down the

3920
02:00:46,479 --> 02:00:52,000
line real estate et cetera it's all down

3921
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:53,039
massively against bitcoin now you could

3922
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:54,800
argue that that's because

3923
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:57,039
bitcoin is appreciating in u.s dollar

3924
02:00:54,800 --> 02:01:00,000
terms or you could actually

3925
02:00:57,039 --> 02:01:01,439
argue that the world is repricing this

3926
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:02,079
asset it's doing price discovery on this

3927
02:01:01,439 --> 02:01:03,759
asset

3928
02:01:02,079 --> 02:01:06,000
and it's essentially comparing it's

3929
02:01:03,760 --> 02:01:07,520
saying hey bitcoin versus this stock or

3930
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:08,000
bitcoin versus this ounce of gold or

3931
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:09,840
bitcoin

3932
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:11,599
verse you know this dollar which is more

3933
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:13,199
valuable and it continues to move up in

3934
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:13,679
the rankings in terms of the value that

3935
02:01:13,198 --> 02:01:15,598
the world

3936
02:01:13,679 --> 02:01:17,440
ascribes to this some that's based on

3937
02:01:15,599 --> 02:01:19,360
lindy effect just the longer it persists

3938
02:01:17,439 --> 02:01:20,719
the more likely it is to survive

3939
02:01:19,359 --> 02:01:22,238
some of that's based on like the

3940
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:23,118
underlying fundamentals of how much

3941
02:01:22,238 --> 02:01:24,959
computing power

3942
02:01:23,118 --> 02:01:27,439
the usage transaction volume things like

3943
02:01:24,960 --> 02:01:29,198
that but some of it also

3944
02:01:27,439 --> 02:01:30,879
is that as more and more people wake up

3945
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:32,960
to the fact that it's a finite supply

3946
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:34,880
asset that has a place in the world

3947
02:01:32,960 --> 02:01:36,239
and demand increases people just

3948
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:38,560
naturally compete and

3949
02:01:36,238 --> 02:01:40,000
ascribe more value to it and so the

3950
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:41,920
volatility

3951
02:01:40,000 --> 02:01:43,118
i think all comes back to like what do

3952
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:44,880
you price

3953
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:46,479
your life in for the majority of people

3954
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:49,199
that's dollars so you look at the us

3955
02:01:46,479 --> 02:01:51,359
dollar price you get all this volatility

3956
02:01:49,198 --> 02:01:52,960
the beauty of this is that 60 that

3957
02:01:51,359 --> 02:01:56,079
doesn't move regardless of

3958
02:01:52,960 --> 02:01:57,039
price upward or downward in movement

3959
02:01:56,079 --> 02:01:59,198
those people aren't looking at the

3960
02:01:57,039 --> 02:02:00,560
day-to-day price what they've basically

3961
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:02,238
said is i've acquired x

3962
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:04,000
amount of bitcoin and i'm just going to

3963
02:02:02,238 --> 02:02:05,439
hold it for years

3964
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,760
and every time somebody's done that

3965
02:02:05,439 --> 02:02:09,598
right if you bought bitcoin at any point

3966
02:02:07,760 --> 02:02:13,760
in the last 12 years and you held it

3967
02:02:09,599 --> 02:02:15,840
till today you are up in us dollar terms

3968
02:02:13,760 --> 02:02:18,079
now if we had this conversation 18

3969
02:02:15,840 --> 02:02:20,319
months ago couldn't say that

3970
02:02:18,079 --> 02:02:21,198
so it's all about not only the

3971
02:02:20,319 --> 02:02:23,359
acquisition

3972
02:02:21,198 --> 02:02:24,238
price if you will it's also when are you

3973
02:02:23,359 --> 02:02:26,238
looking at it

3974
02:02:24,238 --> 02:02:27,359
right because there was a point in 2017

3975
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:28,718
you could have said the same thing but

3976
02:02:27,359 --> 02:02:30,799
in 18 you couldn't

3977
02:02:28,719 --> 02:02:32,079
and so i tend to think a lot about

3978
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:35,360
humans are really really bad

3979
02:02:32,079 --> 02:02:37,039
at short-term uh decision-making

3980
02:02:35,359 --> 02:02:38,559
because we're so emotional especially

3981
02:02:37,039 --> 02:02:39,519
when something has a price tied to it

3982
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:41,360
yeah so it's

3983
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:43,040
in terms of our the strategies and

3984
02:02:41,359 --> 02:02:44,238
decision-making we should be long-term

3985
02:02:43,039 --> 02:02:46,560
and have like a regular

3986
02:02:44,238 --> 02:02:47,919
almost think like an algorithm that in

3987
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:50,400
that in that kind of way

3988
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:52,239
so i think you've tweeted that uh you

3989
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:53,519
believe that bitcoin has a chance of

3990
02:02:52,238 --> 02:02:57,039
reaching one million i don't know what

3991
02:02:53,520 --> 02:03:00,080
it is currently i think it's five

3992
02:02:57,039 --> 02:03:02,238
which is incredible i

3993
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:04,079
think i remember when it was at least in

3994
02:03:02,238 --> 02:03:05,919
the double digits i think i remember was

3995
02:03:04,079 --> 02:03:09,679
in the signal digits of a dollar

3996
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:13,199
so the fact that it's across 50 is crazy

3997
02:03:09,679 --> 02:03:15,199
uh but uh you're even crazier apparently

3998
02:03:13,198 --> 02:03:16,960
thinking that it can reach a million

3999
02:03:15,198 --> 02:03:18,559
so do you think it's possible for it to

4000
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:19,679
reach a million is there some kind of

4001
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:22,000
transformative effects

4002
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:23,279
we'll have to see first when might it

4003
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:25,118
reach a million like

4004
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:26,960
what are the signs that we would look

4005
02:03:25,118 --> 02:03:29,118
for what's required for it to reach a

4006
02:03:26,960 --> 02:03:29,760
million so let's just look at it from a

4007
02:03:29,118 --> 02:03:32,319
macro

4008
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:33,599
perspective uh gold is a 10 trillion

4009
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:35,519
dollar asset

4010
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:37,199
and when you compare the technology of

4011
02:03:35,520 --> 02:03:39,199
gold to the technology of

4012
02:03:37,198 --> 02:03:40,719
bitcoin bitcoin is superior in every

4013
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:42,879
single way right it's more

4014
02:03:40,719 --> 02:03:45,039
portable it's more divisible uh it's

4015
02:03:42,880 --> 02:03:47,599
more verifiable it's more scarce on

4016
02:03:45,039 --> 02:03:49,279
everything and so some people would

4017
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:50,800
argue it's a 10x improvement some people

4018
02:03:49,279 --> 02:03:52,399
argue it's 100x improvement from a

4019
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:57,199
technology standpoint

4020
02:03:52,399 --> 02:04:00,319
and so we don't need bitcoin to actually

4021
02:03:57,198 --> 02:04:01,198
kind of um capture the full 10x or 100x

4022
02:04:00,319 --> 02:04:03,759
improvement from a

4023
02:04:01,198 --> 02:04:04,399
market cap standpoint if bitcoin simply

4024
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:07,360
captures

4025
02:04:04,399 --> 02:04:08,719
2x the value would be a 20 trillion

4026
02:04:07,359 --> 02:04:10,238
dollar market cap which would put

4027
02:04:08,719 --> 02:04:11,520
bitcoin at about a million dollars

4028
02:04:10,238 --> 02:04:13,598
right so kind of just from a macro

4029
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:15,599
perspective if you have a 10x or 100x

4030
02:04:13,599 --> 02:04:17,920
improvement from a technology standpoint

4031
02:04:15,599 --> 02:04:19,440
and you directionally get some value

4032
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:21,760
capture in that direction

4033
02:04:19,439 --> 02:04:23,039
you're hitting around a million or more

4034
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:25,520
uh dollar price point

4035
02:04:23,039 --> 02:04:26,880
you can ask a quick question which is uh

4036
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:27,679
what's the current market cap for

4037
02:04:26,880 --> 02:04:29,039
bitcoin

4038
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:30,639
uh the current market cap's right around

4039
02:04:29,039 --> 02:04:31,039
a trillion just over a trillion dollars

4040
02:04:30,639 --> 02:04:34,000
and

4041
02:04:31,039 --> 02:04:34,719
you're saying gold is 10 trillion and uh

4042
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:36,960
i'm sorry

4043
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:38,800
where did you get the 20 trillion 20

4044
02:04:36,960 --> 02:04:39,679
trillion would just be 2x cold's market

4045
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:41,599
cap

4046
02:04:39,679 --> 02:04:42,719
got it right so if it's a 10x technology

4047
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:44,319
improvement let's just say it only

4048
02:04:42,719 --> 02:04:46,800
captures 2x the market cap

4049
02:04:44,319 --> 02:04:48,399
got it right and so again if it was to

4050
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:49,039
capture just gold's market cap kind of

4051
02:04:48,399 --> 02:04:51,439
the equivalent

4052
02:04:49,039 --> 02:04:52,158
puts you around 500 000 right so you can

4053
02:04:51,439 --> 02:04:54,479
kind of see there's

4054
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:56,000
bitcoin so if you capture the entirety

4055
02:04:54,479 --> 02:04:58,238
of the gold market

4056
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:00,238
uh then it would be value of single

4057
02:04:58,238 --> 02:05:02,078
bitcoin uh the price of a single bitcoin

4058
02:05:00,238 --> 02:05:05,839
would be 500

4059
02:05:02,078 --> 02:05:06,960
000 okay to reach a million it would be

4060
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:08,639
double that

4061
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:10,719
that's what the 20 trillion comes from

4062
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:14,239
correct got it so if you then

4063
02:05:10,719 --> 02:05:17,599
say to yourself okay how does the uh

4064
02:05:14,238 --> 02:05:18,078
the pricing um kind of cycles work right

4065
02:05:17,599 --> 02:05:21,360
or

4066
02:05:18,078 --> 02:05:25,198
the boom and bust cycles gold

4067
02:05:21,359 --> 02:05:28,399
is a very kind of linear type

4068
02:05:25,198 --> 02:05:29,598
supply schedule meaning that there is a

4069
02:05:28,399 --> 02:05:30,638
certain amount of gold that comes out of

4070
02:05:29,599 --> 02:05:34,319
the ground each year

4071
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:35,279
the inter-year variation in that

4072
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:37,039
incoming supply

4073
02:05:35,279 --> 02:05:38,559
is not much right maybe there's an extra

4074
02:05:37,039 --> 02:05:39,279
mining company that gets set up or a

4075
02:05:38,560 --> 02:05:40,719
couple of them

4076
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:42,238
or maybe one goes out of business but

4077
02:05:40,719 --> 02:05:44,000
for the most part the kind of

4078
02:05:42,238 --> 02:05:46,959
inflationary

4079
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:49,760
increase to the supply of gold is pretty

4080
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:52,639
stagnant uh year over year

4081
02:05:49,760 --> 02:05:53,760
bitcoin has a very unique feature which

4082
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:56,560
every four years

4083
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:57,520
there is a programmatic supply shock

4084
02:05:56,560 --> 02:05:59,520
meaning that

4085
02:05:57,520 --> 02:06:01,679
uh in the beginning 50 bitcoin every 10

4086
02:05:59,520 --> 02:06:03,440
minutes was introduced into the supply

4087
02:06:01,679 --> 02:06:05,440
after four years of that happening every

4088
02:06:03,439 --> 02:06:07,598
10 minutes it was cut in half

4089
02:06:05,439 --> 02:06:09,359
so on a in a single moment it went from

4090
02:06:07,599 --> 02:06:11,920
50 to now it was 25.

4091
02:06:09,359 --> 02:06:13,519
four years every 10 minutes 25 got cut

4092
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:16,880
in half again to 12 and a half and then

4093
02:06:13,520 --> 02:06:19,280
recently in may 2020 got cut to 6.25

4094
02:06:16,880 --> 02:06:20,560
when you have an asset that is

4095
02:06:19,279 --> 02:06:22,960
determined the price

4096
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:24,960
based on supply and demand you normally

4097
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:26,399
have two inputs to the equation

4098
02:06:24,960 --> 02:06:28,960
what is the supply and what is the

4099
02:06:26,399 --> 02:06:31,519
demand in an asset like gold

4100
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:32,639
or a stock or anything else we have to

4101
02:06:31,520 --> 02:06:35,040
do our best

4102
02:06:32,639 --> 02:06:36,639
guess at the supply both the existing

4103
02:06:35,039 --> 02:06:38,639
supply and the incoming supply

4104
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:39,920
and do our best guess at the demand and

4105
02:06:38,639 --> 02:06:41,760
we're actually pretty good at this a lot

4106
02:06:39,920 --> 02:06:43,199
of times in terms of directionally

4107
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:44,239
saying it's going to go up or down and

4108
02:06:43,198 --> 02:06:45,678
here's kind of some price point

4109
02:06:44,238 --> 02:06:48,158
milestones

4110
02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:50,239
bitcoin is unique in that there's 100

4111
02:06:48,158 --> 02:06:54,158
verifiable proof

4112
02:06:50,238 --> 02:06:56,879
of the existing supply the total supply

4113
02:06:54,158 --> 02:06:58,638
and the incoming daily supply so we know

4114
02:06:56,880 --> 02:06:59,359
100 i can show you on the actual

4115
02:06:58,639 --> 02:07:00,960
blockchain

4116
02:06:59,359 --> 02:07:03,279
uh or in the code that there's 21

4117
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:04,319
million bitcoin uh and that's all there

4118
02:07:03,279 --> 02:07:06,800
will ever be

4119
02:07:04,319 --> 02:07:07,599
i can show you that there's 18.6 million

4120
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:09,199
give or take

4121
02:07:07,599 --> 02:07:10,960
uh bitcoin that actually are in

4122
02:07:09,198 --> 02:07:11,759
circulation today right now i can go all

4123
02:07:10,960 --> 02:07:12,880
the way back show you every single

4124
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:14,239
transaction that's ever occurred since

4125
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:15,599
january through 2009

4126
02:07:14,238 --> 02:07:17,279
and then i can show you on a daily basis

4127
02:07:15,599 --> 02:07:18,800
that 900 bitcoin a day are coming into

4128
02:07:17,279 --> 02:07:21,198
the circulating supply

4129
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:22,639
and so when you have 100 confidence

4130
02:07:21,198 --> 02:07:25,039
because you can prove

4131
02:07:22,639 --> 02:07:26,159
the supply side of this equation you can

4132
02:07:25,039 --> 02:07:29,279
hold it constant

4133
02:07:26,158 --> 02:07:31,839
i know with 100 accuracy the supply side

4134
02:07:29,279 --> 02:07:33,759
so now i've reduced the mathematical

4135
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,880
equation that i need to do to determine

4136
02:07:33,760 --> 02:07:37,119
price movements

4137
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:38,400
to a 50 reduction i only have to worry

4138
02:07:37,118 --> 02:07:39,598
about demand i don't have to worry about

4139
02:07:38,399 --> 02:07:41,279
supply

4140
02:07:39,599 --> 02:07:43,279
and so when i look at demand i can do

4141
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:44,639
all kinds of things i can take the

4142
02:07:43,279 --> 02:07:46,399
demand over the last 10 years and the

4143
02:07:44,639 --> 02:07:48,960
growth and just extrapolate it out i can

4144
02:07:46,399 --> 02:07:51,679
increase it i can decrease it whatever

4145
02:07:48,960 --> 02:07:52,960
but what you find is that these supply

4146
02:07:51,679 --> 02:07:55,599
shocks

4147
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:57,920
lead to significant price appreciation

4148
02:07:55,599 --> 02:07:59,840
as the asset gets repriced because there

4149
02:07:57,920 --> 02:08:02,319
there's a supply shock to it

4150
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:04,078
and so probably the best thing that i've

4151
02:08:02,319 --> 02:08:06,799
done over the last couple of years was

4152
02:08:04,078 --> 02:08:07,920
in 2019 i started to talk about the idea

4153
02:08:06,800 --> 02:08:08,960
that we were going to have both the

4154
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:13,118
supply shock

4155
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:16,239
and the demand shock in 2021

4156
02:08:13,118 --> 02:08:17,598
or i'm sorry in 2020. i didn't know when

4157
02:08:16,238 --> 02:08:19,678
this bull market that we were in was

4158
02:08:17,599 --> 02:08:20,319
gonna nobody knows right it's impossible

4159
02:08:19,679 --> 02:08:21,760
to time

4160
02:08:20,319 --> 02:08:23,599
these things but you could tell that we

4161
02:08:21,760 --> 02:08:25,280
were kind of at late stages of a cycle

4162
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:27,920
there was inverted yield curves there

4163
02:08:25,279 --> 02:08:29,920
was re uh gyrations in the repo markets

4164
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:31,679
a lot of ceos leaving their jobs you

4165
02:08:29,920 --> 02:08:33,520
know all this kind of stuff

4166
02:08:31,679 --> 02:08:35,039
and all i said was at some point when

4167
02:08:33,520 --> 02:08:36,239
the market turns over

4168
02:08:35,039 --> 02:08:37,920
the government's gonna have to step in

4169
02:08:36,238 --> 02:08:39,198
we are addicted to stimulus they're

4170
02:08:37,920 --> 02:08:40,158
gonna have to manipulate interest rates

4171
02:08:39,198 --> 02:08:41,118
down and they're gonna have to print

4172
02:08:40,158 --> 02:08:43,118
money

4173
02:08:41,118 --> 02:08:44,399
i had no clue that there was gonna be a

4174
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:45,839
global pandemic

4175
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:47,598
that they were gonna have to step in in

4176
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:49,599
such an aggressive way and move rates

4177
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:50,880
not down but down to zero

4178
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:52,000
and that they not only were going to

4179
02:08:50,880 --> 02:08:54,639
print hundreds of billions but they

4180
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:56,399
could print trillions of dollars

4181
02:08:54,639 --> 02:08:58,239
but the framework that i used to think

4182
02:08:56,399 --> 02:09:01,279
about this was when they

4183
02:08:58,238 --> 02:09:02,799
do that everyone is going to run

4184
02:09:01,279 --> 02:09:03,840
to store value assets they're going to

4185
02:09:02,800 --> 02:09:05,279
run to gold they're going to run the

4186
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:07,520
bitcoin et cetera

4187
02:09:05,279 --> 02:09:08,800
and right as they do that it appears at

4188
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:10,079
the same time there's going to be this

4189
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:11,679
supply shock so you're going to get a

4190
02:09:10,078 --> 02:09:13,279
supply shock and a demand shock that are

4191
02:09:11,679 --> 02:09:15,920
both positive for the price and i call

4192
02:09:13,279 --> 02:09:19,279
it rocket fuel for bitcoin

4193
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:20,639
well it happened and here we are i now

4194
02:09:19,279 --> 02:09:22,158
look for and i say okay

4195
02:09:20,639 --> 02:09:23,440
we are likely going to see a hundred

4196
02:09:22,158 --> 02:09:25,039
thousand bitcoin a hundred thousand

4197
02:09:23,439 --> 02:09:26,238
dollar bitcoin this year right at some

4198
02:09:25,039 --> 02:09:27,439
point i don't know when it happens but

4199
02:09:26,238 --> 02:09:30,638
we're moving in that city i think in

4200
02:09:27,439 --> 02:09:32,799
2021 we'll see a hundred thousand

4201
02:09:30,639 --> 02:09:34,000
that would be uh my most conservative

4202
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:35,520
view uh i

4203
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:38,158
i've said a hundred thousand dollars

4204
02:09:35,520 --> 02:09:40,800
since 2019 and people thought that was

4205
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:42,000
insane and crazy and all stuff now i'm

4206
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:42,960
the conservative guy in the room because

4207
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,238
i stick with the hundred thousand

4208
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:47,198
dollars and people are saying

4209
02:09:44,238 --> 02:09:48,799
you know multiples of that number here

4210
02:09:47,198 --> 02:09:50,319
uh so we'll see what happens but

4211
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:52,079
but i think that there's still a lot of

4212
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:53,920
room kind of to run from a u.s dollar

4213
02:09:52,078 --> 02:09:56,078
price standpoint

4214
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:58,639
what is on the horizon is in 2024 we

4215
02:09:56,078 --> 02:10:00,078
will have another supply shock

4216
02:09:58,639 --> 02:10:01,679
and so that's what i think will carry us

4217
02:10:00,078 --> 02:10:03,198
to the million dollar bitcoin from six

4218
02:10:01,679 --> 02:10:05,679
to five to whatever

4219
02:10:03,198 --> 02:10:06,399
50 reduction yeah yeah and so that's

4220
02:10:05,679 --> 02:10:07,920
what i think

4221
02:10:06,399 --> 02:10:09,679
uh we'll basically when we get that's

4222
02:10:07,920 --> 02:10:10,480
that next supply shock that'll carry us

4223
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:13,199
up over 100

4224
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:14,078
or over a 1 million dollar bitcoin price

4225
02:10:13,198 --> 02:10:17,439
which

4226
02:10:14,078 --> 02:10:19,039
if historical examples persist and again

4227
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:21,198
sometimes it's hard to use historical

4228
02:10:19,039 --> 02:10:23,519
examples to uh look at future

4229
02:10:21,198 --> 02:10:25,359
events um but if that happens we would

4230
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:28,960
see a million dollars of bitcoin

4231
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:31,759
by the end of 2026. after that wave

4232
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:32,399
so 2024 basically is the supply shock

4233
02:10:31,760 --> 02:10:34,880
and within

4234
02:10:32,399 --> 02:10:35,759
you know 18 to 24 months you would see

4235
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:37,359
the uh

4236
02:10:35,760 --> 02:10:39,119
the kind of top of the next market

4237
02:10:37,359 --> 02:10:42,238
hopefully without a coupling to the net

4238
02:10:39,118 --> 02:10:44,000
to another pandemic yes we would like to

4239
02:10:42,238 --> 02:10:46,479
do all of this without a

4240
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,198
public health crisis so that would take

4241
02:10:46,479 --> 02:10:50,078
it to

4242
02:10:47,198 --> 02:10:51,519
would uh 20 trillion you don't have to

4243
02:10:50,078 --> 02:10:54,078
compare it to the dollar

4244
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:55,760
essentially in some sense that the

4245
02:10:54,078 --> 02:10:57,359
dollar could also lose value i mean

4246
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:58,639
there's a lot of kind of dynamics at

4247
02:10:57,359 --> 02:11:00,319
play here

4248
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:02,000
now but like fundamentally there's going

4249
02:11:00,319 --> 02:11:05,439
to be a huge

4250
02:11:02,000 --> 02:11:07,520
move in your prediction of value into

4251
02:11:05,439 --> 02:11:10,319
into bitcoin i mean that's a fascinating

4252
02:11:07,520 --> 02:11:13,599
world to think about

4253
02:11:10,319 --> 02:11:16,158
uh i mean but i do have to kind of

4254
02:11:13,599 --> 02:11:17,279
ask you about the whole space of

4255
02:11:16,158 --> 02:11:18,479
technology there because

4256
02:11:17,279 --> 02:11:20,319
we're talking about the value of

4257
02:11:18,479 --> 02:11:22,799
security we're talking about the

4258
02:11:20,319 --> 02:11:26,960
the future which bitcoin will be at the

4259
02:11:22,800 --> 02:11:29,679
center of but from my perspective of

4260
02:11:26,960 --> 02:11:31,439
thinking how like i and others can build

4261
02:11:29,679 --> 02:11:33,440
technologies on top of

4262
02:11:31,439 --> 02:11:35,039
this kind of decentralized world i'm

4263
02:11:33,439 --> 02:11:36,319
thinking about different tech

4264
02:11:35,039 --> 02:11:38,238
different technologies out there

4265
02:11:36,319 --> 02:11:41,198
different cryptocurrencies out there

4266
02:11:38,238 --> 02:11:42,000
ethereum being one but there's a lot of

4267
02:11:41,198 --> 02:11:43,839
others

4268
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,279
so i'd love to get your sort of ideas

4269
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:47,760
about some of these but

4270
02:11:45,279 --> 02:11:50,238
so first let me ask you about what the

4271
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:53,199
hell is [ __ ] coin

4272
02:11:50,238 --> 02:11:54,879
is this connected to uh to our previous

4273
02:11:53,198 --> 02:11:57,359
discussion of the meme

4274
02:11:54,880 --> 02:11:59,440
uh does [ __ ] coin cover basically all

4275
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:02,799
coins that are not

4276
02:11:59,439 --> 02:12:05,439
bitcoin is it uh uh

4277
02:12:02,800 --> 02:12:06,639
mean is it a beautiful is this a mixture

4278
02:12:05,439 --> 02:12:08,638
of both

4279
02:12:06,639 --> 02:12:10,880
as with most things in life uh depends

4280
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:14,078
who you ask um

4281
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:17,599
the uh most um uh

4282
02:12:14,078 --> 02:12:19,359
kind of enthusiastic and uh uh

4283
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:20,960
parts of the bitcoin community shitcoin

4284
02:12:19,359 --> 02:12:23,359
is anything else

4285
02:12:20,960 --> 02:12:25,118
right kind of if you ascribe to kind of

4286
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:27,039
a maximalistic view of the world

4287
02:12:25,118 --> 02:12:28,799
should run be anything if you look at

4288
02:12:27,039 --> 02:12:29,840
people who i would say are bitcoin

4289
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:33,119
proponents

4290
02:12:29,840 --> 02:12:36,239
uh yet see value in other things

4291
02:12:33,118 --> 02:12:36,960
[ __ ] coin may be the bottom half of the

4292
02:12:36,238 --> 02:12:38,559
other things

4293
02:12:36,960 --> 02:12:40,000
right so i think again it's really

4294
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:42,079
important kind of who you

4295
02:12:40,000 --> 02:12:43,039
ask is how you'll get that answer so

4296
02:12:42,078 --> 02:12:44,880
there's tiers

4297
02:12:43,039 --> 02:12:46,560
and the way you divide those tiers might

4298
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:48,480
be different depending who you ask

4299
02:12:46,560 --> 02:12:50,239
ultimately what it is is it's a meme

4300
02:12:48,479 --> 02:12:53,598
yeah and it's used to

4301
02:12:50,238 --> 02:12:54,959
uh articulate the idea that

4302
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:57,199
whatever you want to put in that bucket

4303
02:12:54,960 --> 02:12:59,520
has no value so [ __ ] coin

4304
02:12:57,198 --> 02:13:01,039
are coins that have no value yeah uh

4305
02:12:59,520 --> 02:13:03,119
what is fascinating

4306
02:13:01,039 --> 02:13:05,039
about it and i think that again speaks

4307
02:13:03,118 --> 02:13:07,519
to the power of the bitcoin community

4308
02:13:05,039 --> 02:13:08,560
is uh there was congressional hearings a

4309
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:11,280
couple of years ago

4310
02:13:08,560 --> 02:13:13,599
oh no and at one point uh a congressman

4311
02:13:11,279 --> 02:13:16,479
from ohio warren davidson who

4312
02:13:13,599 --> 02:13:17,840
was definitely open-minded and excited

4313
02:13:16,479 --> 02:13:20,399
about bitcoin

4314
02:13:17,840 --> 02:13:20,880
asked a an individual on the congress

4315
02:13:20,399 --> 02:13:24,479
floor

4316
02:13:20,880 --> 02:13:26,719
uh during testimony to uh talk about

4317
02:13:24,479 --> 02:13:28,319
these other coins and at one point

4318
02:13:26,719 --> 02:13:31,439
basically read into the

4319
02:13:28,319 --> 02:13:32,639
record the terminology of [ __ ] coin he

4320
02:13:31,439 --> 02:13:34,638
said the word [ __ ] coin

4321
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:36,239
uh i i can't remember if he said it

4322
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:37,679
first somebody else did it or if uh the

4323
02:13:36,238 --> 02:13:40,399
other person did and then he

4324
02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:40,960
um you know repeated it uh but he

4325
02:13:40,399 --> 02:13:42,799
definitely

4326
02:13:40,960 --> 02:13:44,000
he was trying to get that read into the

4327
02:13:42,800 --> 02:13:47,039
record yes uh for

4328
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:50,639
sure and so uh yeah you can imagine

4329
02:13:47,039 --> 02:13:51,279
one again the meme speaking insolently

4330
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:53,199
to the

4331
02:13:51,279 --> 02:13:54,800
bitcoin community was you know made him

4332
02:13:53,198 --> 02:13:58,000
very uh very well liked

4333
02:13:54,800 --> 02:14:00,800
uh but also too was um it does go

4334
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:03,279
back to this idea almost of uh if you

4335
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:05,440
and i sat down with 10 ceos

4336
02:14:03,279 --> 02:14:06,238
and we interviewed each one of them and

4337
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:07,919
then we went in a room and we

4338
02:14:06,238 --> 02:14:09,279
deliberated and we said we have to pick

4339
02:14:07,920 --> 02:14:10,800
the person who's going to be the most

4340
02:14:09,279 --> 02:14:12,399
successful

4341
02:14:10,800 --> 02:14:13,920
one of the inputs not all the inputs but

4342
02:14:12,399 --> 02:14:14,638
one of the inputs would be who's the

4343
02:14:13,920 --> 02:14:17,199
person who

4344
02:14:14,639 --> 02:14:17,840
we believe has the best ability to raise

4345
02:14:17,198 --> 02:14:20,879
capital

4346
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:21,599
recruit people and tell a story to the

4347
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:24,960
world

4348
02:14:21,599 --> 02:14:26,480
that will get them to follow and so

4349
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:28,239
somebody like elon would probably be the

4350
02:14:26,479 --> 02:14:30,718
best example of this

4351
02:14:28,238 --> 02:14:31,678
when you have decentralized products you

4352
02:14:30,719 --> 02:14:34,000
have no kind of

4353
02:14:31,679 --> 02:14:35,199
leader right in the sense of uh somebody

4354
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,198
who is financially

4355
02:14:35,198 --> 02:14:39,198
uh ascribed to be that leader and kind

4356
02:14:37,198 --> 02:14:40,238
of the the executive decision maker

4357
02:14:39,198 --> 02:14:41,519
so what you have to do is you have to

4358
02:14:40,238 --> 02:14:43,118
look at these technologies in these

4359
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:46,239
communities and say

4360
02:14:43,118 --> 02:14:48,238
well which volunteer teams or which

4361
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:49,919
technologies have been able to coalesce

4362
02:14:48,238 --> 02:14:53,279
these groups around it

4363
02:14:49,920 --> 02:14:54,000
and in some way build the same level of

4364
02:14:53,279 --> 02:14:56,479
engagement

4365
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:57,439
and protection and things like that and

4366
02:14:56,479 --> 02:14:59,839
so

4367
02:14:57,439 --> 02:15:00,719
you actually get tribalism but you also

4368
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:03,599
get things like

4369
02:15:00,719 --> 02:15:05,359
[ __ ] coin because what it does is it's

4370
02:15:03,599 --> 02:15:08,560
not only a

4371
02:15:05,359 --> 02:15:12,078
kind of verbal attack towards uh

4372
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:14,639
others it's a rallying cry for

4373
02:15:12,078 --> 02:15:16,559
internal what's so funny is that it was

4374
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:18,078
started with the bitcoin community

4375
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:19,760
talking about everybody but now you've

4376
02:15:18,078 --> 02:15:20,319
seen adoption in other communities who

4377
02:15:19,760 --> 02:15:21,679
use it

4378
02:15:20,319 --> 02:15:23,599
you know basically say well we're not a

4379
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:26,000
[ __ ] coin it's the it's the next guy

4380
02:15:23,599 --> 02:15:26,719
yeah i mean the meaning to be honest

4381
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:30,639
it's

4382
02:15:26,719 --> 02:15:32,880
it's one it's off it's sometimes misused

4383
02:15:30,639 --> 02:15:34,319
i think like with anything it's like

4384
02:15:32,880 --> 02:15:36,639
people adopt memes

4385
02:15:34,319 --> 02:15:37,519
that we used to be brilliant or still

4386
02:15:36,639 --> 02:15:39,599
brilliant

4387
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:40,960
and they're just not good at using them

4388
02:15:39,599 --> 02:15:44,560
so they become

4389
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:47,279
mean but when you do

4390
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:48,000
with with grace it can tear down an

4391
02:15:47,279 --> 02:15:51,198
argument

4392
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:52,800
and at the same time have like love and

4393
02:15:51,198 --> 02:15:54,799
respect underneath it i mean it's a

4394
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:57,279
beautiful dance they have to be good at

4395
02:15:54,800 --> 02:15:59,039
like you know people just can suck at

4396
02:15:57,279 --> 02:16:01,118
communication and even

4397
02:15:59,039 --> 02:16:02,800
uh like even a powerful weapon like a

4398
02:16:01,118 --> 02:16:06,238
meme in the wrong hands

4399
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:07,440
just uh fires in a way that doesn't get

4400
02:16:06,238 --> 02:16:10,399
anything done

4401
02:16:07,439 --> 02:16:12,559
but this is like a war of humor and

4402
02:16:10,399 --> 02:16:14,799
memes it's kind of fascinating exactly

4403
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:16,880
like you formulated that there's

4404
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:19,840
asymmetry of power so you have to have

4405
02:16:16,880 --> 02:16:22,719
guerilla warfare in this internet

4406
02:16:19,840 --> 02:16:24,719
game especially when there's no leader

4407
02:16:22,719 --> 02:16:28,158
like you said in a distributed culture

4408
02:16:24,719 --> 02:16:31,279
here that is um is really important i

4409
02:16:28,158 --> 02:16:35,039
think is from a society standpoint

4410
02:16:31,279 --> 02:16:35,840
we've become very soft and very kind of

4411
02:16:35,040 --> 02:16:38,880
coddling

4412
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:40,318
and not in um not in a way that's like i

4413
02:16:38,879 --> 02:16:42,318
think people take this argument like too

4414
02:16:40,318 --> 02:16:43,840
far sometimes but what i mean by that is

4415
02:16:42,318 --> 02:16:45,359
um

4416
02:16:43,840 --> 02:16:46,960
it's almost like if you're the person

4417
02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:48,800
who holds somebody accountable

4418
02:16:46,959 --> 02:16:50,318
you become the bad person right if

4419
02:16:48,799 --> 02:16:53,358
you're the person who

4420
02:16:50,318 --> 02:16:54,239
um says hey you know that's wrong you're

4421
02:16:53,359 --> 02:16:57,599
the bad person

4422
02:16:54,239 --> 02:17:00,239
right and so in a world where i think in

4423
02:16:57,599 --> 02:17:02,159
this kind of influencery you know all

4424
02:17:00,239 --> 02:17:03,840
positive if you have any negative

4425
02:17:02,159 --> 02:17:06,000
you know feedback or constructive

4426
02:17:03,840 --> 02:17:09,599
criticism like you're the bad person

4427
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:11,760
uh it's the ultimate echo chamber right

4428
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:13,120
and so i think that what the bitcoin

4429
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:17,040
world does

4430
02:17:13,120 --> 02:17:19,760
and some crazy crazy way to look at it

4431
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:20,160
is bitcoin is ultimately about truth

4432
02:17:19,760 --> 02:17:23,439
yeah

4433
02:17:20,159 --> 02:17:27,119
not about narrative not about feelings

4434
02:17:23,439 --> 02:17:28,398
or emotion it's math yeah you look at a

4435
02:17:27,120 --> 02:17:32,000
blockchain

4436
02:17:28,398 --> 02:17:33,199
and you can prove something or you can't

4437
02:17:32,000 --> 02:17:35,120
and so naturally people who are

4438
02:17:33,200 --> 02:17:35,920
attracted to that have a very similar

4439
02:17:35,120 --> 02:17:39,120
approach in life

4440
02:17:35,920 --> 02:17:41,439
yeah right they say hey you made x claim

4441
02:17:39,120 --> 02:17:43,599
prove it and as you can imagine you know

4442
02:17:41,439 --> 02:17:44,159
a great example is like the financial

4443
02:17:43,599 --> 02:17:47,519
media

4444
02:17:44,159 --> 02:17:50,159
meets bitcoiners and it's a bloodbath

4445
02:17:47,519 --> 02:17:50,960
right in kind of the the arena of ideas

4446
02:17:50,159 --> 02:17:52,638
because

4447
02:17:50,959 --> 02:17:54,079
what do they do the financial media is

4448
02:17:52,638 --> 02:17:56,159
used to the soft

4449
02:17:54,079 --> 02:17:57,679
you know opinion pieces et cetera and

4450
02:17:56,159 --> 02:18:00,000
bitcoiners show up and they're like

4451
02:17:57,679 --> 02:18:01,760
uh here's data point a b and c here's

4452
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:02,718
example one two and three and you're

4453
02:18:01,760 --> 02:18:04,239
wrong

4454
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:06,799
and then all they yell and scream about

4455
02:18:04,239 --> 02:18:07,119
is like uh i'm wrong i'm wrong i'm wrong

4456
02:18:06,799 --> 02:18:08,959
like

4457
02:18:07,120 --> 02:18:10,240
you can't say i'm wrong and like no like

4458
02:18:08,959 --> 02:18:11,919
disprove what i just said

4459
02:18:10,239 --> 02:18:13,119
and so you get in this like very very

4460
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:14,318
weird it's fascinating it's a

4461
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:16,639
fascinating benefit but

4462
02:18:14,318 --> 02:18:17,760
i i do want to say it's it i've been

4463
02:18:16,638 --> 02:18:20,799
watching this

4464
02:18:17,760 --> 02:18:24,000
it's kind of interesting i think that

4465
02:18:20,799 --> 02:18:27,840
the pursuit of truth through like

4466
02:18:24,000 --> 02:18:28,558
tearing down bad ideas can be done with

4467
02:18:27,840 --> 02:18:30,960
grace

4468
02:18:28,558 --> 02:18:31,920
and to do it with grace requires a lot

4469
02:18:30,959 --> 02:18:33,759
of skill

4470
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:36,000
like what people don't realize about

4471
02:18:33,760 --> 02:18:38,880
this agreement

4472
02:18:36,000 --> 02:18:39,280
they think that disagreement is easy

4473
02:18:38,879 --> 02:18:43,438
like

4474
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:45,359
they they see the the the lies or the

4475
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:47,200
inaccuracies in the statement

4476
02:18:45,359 --> 02:18:49,439
and and they just think they can say

4477
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:51,920
wrong

4478
02:18:49,439 --> 02:18:54,318
yes you can say that but if you want to

4479
02:18:51,920 --> 02:18:57,280
be effective

4480
02:18:54,318 --> 02:18:57,920
it requires great skill like you look at

4481
02:18:57,280 --> 02:19:01,359
i don't know

4482
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:03,599
um a beautiful uh

4483
02:19:01,359 --> 02:19:05,920
verbal [ __ ] poster which is christopher

4484
02:19:03,599 --> 02:19:08,639
hitchens right

4485
02:19:05,920 --> 02:19:09,359
it requires a lot of skill through your

4486
02:19:08,638 --> 02:19:13,518
words

4487
02:19:09,359 --> 02:19:16,639
to tear down an argument to criticize

4488
02:19:13,519 --> 02:19:18,800
and to take a step towards truth uh

4489
02:19:16,638 --> 02:19:20,079
what i'm disheartened by internet

4490
02:19:18,799 --> 02:19:23,518
culture like the negative

4491
02:19:20,079 --> 02:19:26,879
side is people don't put a lot of effort

4492
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:29,040
in their tear downs like into your [ __ ]

4493
02:19:26,879 --> 02:19:32,318
posting into your memes

4494
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:34,800
you should put effort and see it as a

4495
02:19:32,318 --> 02:19:36,638
skill that you want to if you want to be

4496
02:19:34,799 --> 02:19:40,000
a part of this culture

4497
02:19:36,638 --> 02:19:40,558
you want to uh get good at it like any

4498
02:19:40,000 --> 02:19:44,079
skill

4499
02:19:40,558 --> 02:19:47,039
to 10 000 hours like get improve

4500
02:19:44,079 --> 02:19:48,318
deliberate practice self-criticism all

4501
02:19:47,040 --> 02:19:50,880
of those things

4502
02:19:48,318 --> 02:19:51,680
just because you're anonymous doesn't

4503
02:19:50,879 --> 02:19:53,920
mean

4504
02:19:51,680 --> 02:19:55,520
you won't get deep joy and actually have

4505
02:19:53,920 --> 02:19:58,719
an impact on the world if you get

4506
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:59,040
good at [ __ ] posting but but but i think

4507
02:19:58,719 --> 02:20:00,318
this is

4508
02:19:59,040 --> 02:20:02,399
really really important right because

4509
02:20:00,318 --> 02:20:03,680
you're right in that uh it's all about

4510
02:20:02,398 --> 02:20:06,478
intention versus action

4511
02:20:03,680 --> 02:20:07,359
if your intention is to uh tell somebody

4512
02:20:06,478 --> 02:20:09,599
that they are wrong

4513
02:20:07,359 --> 02:20:10,720
in an effort to get them to see the

4514
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:11,840
truth yes

4515
02:20:10,719 --> 02:20:12,879
that's very different than if your

4516
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:14,398
intention is to tell someone they're

4517
02:20:12,879 --> 02:20:16,959
wrong and hurt their feelings yes

4518
02:20:14,398 --> 02:20:18,639
right and so when you can unpack and

4519
02:20:16,959 --> 02:20:19,919
tension in action

4520
02:20:18,639 --> 02:20:22,079
you really quickly can tell what

4521
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:23,439
somebody ultimately is trying to

4522
02:20:22,079 --> 02:20:25,600
accomplish

4523
02:20:23,439 --> 02:20:26,960
i also think that one of the craziest

4524
02:20:25,600 --> 02:20:30,159
things that i've seen play out

4525
02:20:26,959 --> 02:20:32,000
is uh memes when i use that term i'm not

4526
02:20:30,159 --> 02:20:32,879
just talking about like a static photo

4527
02:20:32,000 --> 02:20:33,760
right when i'm talking about these

4528
02:20:32,879 --> 02:20:36,079
elaborate

4529
02:20:33,760 --> 02:20:36,800
uh kind of edited videos and kind of all

4530
02:20:36,079 --> 02:20:40,559
this stuff

4531
02:20:36,799 --> 02:20:44,639
um when done right

4532
02:20:40,559 --> 02:20:47,600
it is uh the most articulate

4533
02:20:44,639 --> 02:20:49,840
way to deliver a blunt message and it's

4534
02:20:47,600 --> 02:20:51,280
done in such a way that is humorous and

4535
02:20:49,840 --> 02:20:55,680
entertaining

4536
02:20:51,280 --> 02:20:57,359
yet really hammers the point home and so

4537
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:58,720
it's a skill set that many people don't

4538
02:20:57,359 --> 02:21:00,079
have i don't make those i'm

4539
02:20:58,719 --> 02:21:02,000
assuming you don't make them either

4540
02:21:00,079 --> 02:21:02,398
right i see them i share the ones that i

4541
02:21:02,000 --> 02:21:05,680
like

4542
02:21:02,398 --> 02:21:07,279
right uh but it does take practice

4543
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:09,359
and you can tell look there's people who

4544
02:21:07,280 --> 02:21:11,040
are fantastic meme lords

4545
02:21:09,359 --> 02:21:12,880
right and there are people who

4546
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:16,080
absolutely suck at it

4547
02:21:12,879 --> 02:21:18,000
and it's like anything it's just how

4548
02:21:16,079 --> 02:21:20,000
good are you at communicating

4549
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:21,760
and i've heard the idea a bunch of times

4550
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,478
so i don't know who to kind of credit

4551
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:25,600
for it but

4552
02:21:22,478 --> 02:21:27,279
uh whether it's emojis it's gifs it's

4553
02:21:25,600 --> 02:21:29,120
memes whatever

4554
02:21:27,280 --> 02:21:31,280
this is the extension and evolution of

4555
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:33,439
just hieroglyphics

4556
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:34,640
right yeah like like we have been doing

4557
02:21:33,439 --> 02:21:36,639
this for literally

4558
02:21:34,639 --> 02:21:37,840
centuries it's just that now we're doing

4559
02:21:36,639 --> 02:21:39,279
it on the internet and you can press a

4560
02:21:37,840 --> 02:21:41,120
button and go to millions and millions

4561
02:21:39,280 --> 02:21:43,760
of people immediately

4562
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:44,479
uh but speaking of memes what the heck

4563
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:47,120
do you think is

4564
02:21:44,478 --> 02:21:48,318
up with elon musk talking about dogecoin

4565
02:21:47,120 --> 02:21:50,079
a lot

4566
02:21:48,318 --> 02:21:51,600
sort of uh from the cryptocurrency

4567
02:21:50,079 --> 02:21:54,000
community i

4568
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:55,280
uh from i've been talking to a lot of

4569
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:57,200
sort of technologists

4570
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:58,720
i guess and reading papers on

4571
02:21:57,200 --> 02:22:01,920
cryptocurrency

4572
02:21:58,719 --> 02:22:04,559
it's like nobody really sees

4573
02:22:01,920 --> 02:22:05,439
dogecoin as a revolutionary crypto

4574
02:22:04,559 --> 02:22:07,279
technology

4575
02:22:05,439 --> 02:22:09,920
a lot of people talk about security

4576
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:13,040
issues there's a bunch of issues it has

4577
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:17,200
nevertheless you did say that money

4578
02:22:13,040 --> 02:22:21,520
is the kind of social construct right

4579
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:24,079
and uh elon musk's combination of humor

4580
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:25,600
and brilliant engineering in the various

4581
02:22:24,079 --> 02:22:29,200
companies he runs

4582
02:22:25,600 --> 02:22:33,280
combines to create a kind of value

4583
02:22:29,200 --> 02:22:36,399
and excitement behind dogecoin it's like

4584
02:22:33,280 --> 02:22:38,960
what is it he says that the most

4585
02:22:36,398 --> 02:22:40,159
amusing outcome is is the most likely

4586
02:22:38,959 --> 02:22:42,879
kind of idea

4587
02:22:40,159 --> 02:22:44,559
which sounds silly but there could be

4588
02:22:42,879 --> 02:22:46,799
like profound truth to it

4589
02:22:44,559 --> 02:22:48,478
it's like what do you make of deutsche

4590
02:22:46,799 --> 02:22:51,039
coin philosophically

4591
02:22:48,478 --> 02:22:53,039
or technically is is it possible that

4592
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:55,359
deutsche coin will overtake bitcoin and

4593
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:57,680
run the entire

4594
02:22:55,359 --> 02:22:59,359
run the entire world i can't even

4595
02:22:57,680 --> 02:23:02,318
because it could happen

4596
02:22:59,359 --> 02:23:04,720
it could happen but what uh if there's

4597
02:23:02,318 --> 02:23:08,159
any serious way to answer that question

4598
02:23:04,719 --> 02:23:08,879
well we have to start with uh techno

4599
02:23:08,159 --> 02:23:12,000
king

4600
02:23:08,879 --> 02:23:14,000
of tesla yeah and master of coin

4601
02:23:12,000 --> 02:23:15,680
as they are so articulately called in

4602
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:17,359
the latest sec filing

4603
02:23:15,680 --> 02:23:19,520
because he officially changed his title

4604
02:23:17,359 --> 02:23:22,479
techno king yes techno king of tesla

4605
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:24,000
and now the cfo's new uh title is a

4606
02:23:22,478 --> 02:23:28,239
master of coin

4607
02:23:24,000 --> 02:23:32,079
and so uh when you have a sense of humor

4608
02:23:28,239 --> 02:23:35,840
yeah and frankly uh a level of uh

4609
02:23:32,079 --> 02:23:38,079
self-confidence and uh an element

4610
02:23:35,840 --> 02:23:39,520
of uh an appreciation for irony in the

4611
02:23:38,079 --> 02:23:42,000
world

4612
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:44,399
dogecoin is actually one of the least

4613
02:23:42,000 --> 02:23:46,239
crazy things that you could talk about

4614
02:23:44,398 --> 02:23:48,239
when you're willing to go to techno king

4615
02:23:46,239 --> 02:23:51,199
of tesla master of coin

4616
02:23:48,239 --> 02:23:51,600
uh and all this stuff and so i think

4617
02:23:51,200 --> 02:23:53,680
that

4618
02:23:51,600 --> 02:23:55,280
elon uh doesn't get enough credit

4619
02:23:53,680 --> 02:23:56,559
frankly for his understanding of

4620
02:23:55,280 --> 02:23:58,960
internet culture

4621
02:23:56,559 --> 02:24:00,799
understanding of memes and understanding

4622
02:23:58,959 --> 02:24:02,000
of frankly human psychology and

4623
02:24:00,799 --> 02:24:04,959
marketing

4624
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:06,799
and so in some crazy way every time he

4625
02:24:04,959 --> 02:24:08,478
talks about dogecoin

4626
02:24:06,799 --> 02:24:09,920
it's a rallying cry for an entire

4627
02:24:08,478 --> 02:24:11,679
generation of kids

4628
02:24:09,920 --> 02:24:13,680
it's a rallying cry for an entire

4629
02:24:11,680 --> 02:24:15,840
industry in terms of cryptocurrencies

4630
02:24:13,680 --> 02:24:19,040
and digital technologies

4631
02:24:15,840 --> 02:24:21,120
but this is the flag yeah

4632
02:24:19,040 --> 02:24:22,080
and this is the thing that he can yell

4633
02:24:21,120 --> 02:24:25,040
and scream about

4634
02:24:22,079 --> 02:24:26,000
and tweet about without worry of

4635
02:24:25,040 --> 02:24:27,680
punishment

4636
02:24:26,000 --> 02:24:29,680
so he could be talking about bitcoin he

4637
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:32,559
could be talking about cryptocurrency

4638
02:24:29,680 --> 02:24:33,439
but that's not going to be uh as

4639
02:24:32,559 --> 02:24:35,359
beautifully

4640
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:36,639
humorous and whatever the hell internet

4641
02:24:35,359 --> 02:24:38,880
culture is as

4642
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:41,039
dogecoin he's finding the right language

4643
02:24:38,879 --> 02:24:44,079
he's speaking the language of the people

4644
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:45,359
of the in the digital age if you want to

4645
02:24:44,079 --> 02:24:47,280
reach weird people

4646
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:48,960
yeah you can't be serious and most

4647
02:24:47,280 --> 02:24:51,359
people are weird

4648
02:24:48,959 --> 02:24:52,799
the the masses are weird so he's

4649
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:54,640
speaking to the masses

4650
02:24:52,799 --> 02:24:56,398
yeah and the techno king and even

4651
02:24:54,639 --> 02:25:00,079
further than that i think is

4652
02:24:56,398 --> 02:25:04,159
he essentially is um he's using

4653
02:25:00,079 --> 02:25:06,799
dogecoin as a way to say

4654
02:25:04,159 --> 02:25:08,000
i'm doing this because i can yeah he

4655
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:11,519
couldn't do it

4656
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:13,280
with securities he couldn't do it with

4657
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:14,560
certain types of other assets right

4658
02:25:13,280 --> 02:25:16,079
like i almost look at this like a venn

4659
02:25:14,559 --> 02:25:17,039
diagram what's the thing that a bunch of

4660
02:25:16,079 --> 02:25:19,680
people know about

4661
02:25:17,040 --> 02:25:20,240
care about thinkers funny whatever and

4662
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:21,600
also

4663
02:25:20,239 --> 02:25:22,799
overlay that with the things that like

4664
02:25:21,600 --> 02:25:24,159
he could actually talk about they won't

4665
02:25:22,799 --> 02:25:26,799
get in trouble for

4666
02:25:24,159 --> 02:25:27,359
that's a big fu to the sec i could see

4667
02:25:26,799 --> 02:25:30,079
the

4668
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:30,720
the people just freaking out i i mean i

4669
02:25:30,079 --> 02:25:33,039
love it

4670
02:25:30,719 --> 02:25:34,559
but um i i don't know if i would have

4671
02:25:33,040 --> 02:25:36,880
the guts to do it myself

4672
02:25:34,559 --> 02:25:39,199
but i i think he's an inspiration to a

4673
02:25:36,879 --> 02:25:40,879
lot of us to be like well maybe you

4674
02:25:39,200 --> 02:25:42,399
should grow the guts

4675
02:25:40,879 --> 02:25:43,389
when you're the techno king you can do

4676
02:25:42,398 --> 02:25:45,920
whatever you want right

4677
02:25:43,389 --> 02:25:47,920
[Laughter]

4678
02:25:45,920 --> 02:25:49,760
and i mean that's something to aspire to

4679
02:25:47,920 --> 02:25:51,040
is to be the techno king in your own

4680
02:25:49,760 --> 02:25:52,559
little world

4681
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:54,560
if you also think about it in the sense

4682
02:25:52,559 --> 02:25:58,079
of uh when you're somebody on a mission

4683
02:25:54,559 --> 02:26:02,239
to create interplanetary

4684
02:25:58,079 --> 02:26:05,280
life yeah when you're trying to solve

4685
02:26:02,239 --> 02:26:07,039
a or put a dent in the climate crisis

4686
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:08,640
or create electric vehicles and be the

4687
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:10,880
first american company and you know

4688
02:26:08,639 --> 02:26:14,159
however long

4689
02:26:10,879 --> 02:26:16,318
frankly the sec or

4690
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:17,920
other things in your life that just

4691
02:26:16,318 --> 02:26:20,639
don't you don't ascribe that much

4692
02:26:17,920 --> 02:26:23,840
importance to compared to those things

4693
02:26:20,639 --> 02:26:25,840
they're almost uh nuisances and

4694
02:26:23,840 --> 02:26:27,200
that's scary i think for shareholders of

4695
02:26:25,840 --> 02:26:28,799
a company when

4696
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:30,319
the person that you're trusting to lead

4697
02:26:28,799 --> 02:26:31,599
you to the promised land and create

4698
02:26:30,318 --> 02:26:34,719
shareholder value

4699
02:26:31,600 --> 02:26:36,318
doesn't put value on certain things but

4700
02:26:34,719 --> 02:26:38,879
at the same time

4701
02:26:36,318 --> 02:26:40,799
i always look at it as a tug of war how

4702
02:26:38,879 --> 02:26:43,039
much of the actions of what he's doing

4703
02:26:40,799 --> 02:26:44,079
and calling attention to actually

4704
02:26:43,040 --> 02:26:47,200
changed the way

4705
02:26:44,079 --> 02:26:50,639
that regulators lawmakers politicians

4706
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:51,439
countries whatever act he may not be

4707
02:26:50,639 --> 02:26:53,920
able to say

4708
02:26:51,439 --> 02:26:55,280
do x i'm the techno king and they go do

4709
02:26:53,920 --> 02:26:59,040
it

4710
02:26:55,280 --> 02:27:01,680
but with every step he makes he

4711
02:26:59,040 --> 02:27:03,760
changes some of their behavior and so i

4712
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:07,120
think that it's um

4713
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:09,520
a really kind of game of like 3d chess

4714
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:11,280
that frankly i'm not privy to right i'm

4715
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:14,319
kind of watching from the sidelines and

4716
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:17,040
uh figuring out alongside everybody else

4717
02:27:14,318 --> 02:27:18,000
but i also don't think that it's just

4718
02:27:17,040 --> 02:27:19,840
elon

4719
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,879
uh bought a bunch of dogecoin and tweets

4720
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:22,398
about it because he thinks he's going to

4721
02:27:20,879 --> 02:27:23,519
a dollar and he's gonna you know make

4722
02:27:22,398 --> 02:27:25,519
money right like i don't think

4723
02:27:23,520 --> 02:27:26,960
i don't think it's an economic argument

4724
02:27:25,520 --> 02:27:28,560
as to why he's so interested in it i

4725
02:27:26,959 --> 02:27:31,839
think it's much more

4726
02:27:28,559 --> 02:27:34,478
uh it's almost like meta message

4727
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:36,239
for a lot of other stuff yeah he's kind

4728
02:27:34,478 --> 02:27:38,159
of uh trying to break apart

4729
02:27:36,239 --> 02:27:39,600
internet communication from first

4730
02:27:38,159 --> 02:27:40,879
principles like he does so many other

4731
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:42,159
problems it's kind of fascinating to

4732
02:27:40,879 --> 02:27:44,318
watch i know he's been

4733
02:27:42,159 --> 02:27:45,600
uh he's he's taught me quite a bit about

4734
02:27:44,318 --> 02:27:48,879
communication

4735
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:52,399
and uh at least for me

4736
02:27:48,879 --> 02:27:56,000
it's been liberating to not give a

4737
02:27:52,398 --> 02:27:58,398
[ __ ] about the old school way of things

4738
02:27:56,000 --> 02:28:00,799
i've been always bothered by a place i

4739
02:27:58,398 --> 02:28:03,279
deeply admire which is mit

4740
02:28:00,799 --> 02:28:05,039
but there's problems the bureaucracies

4741
02:28:03,280 --> 02:28:07,120
and hierarchies that hold back

4742
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:10,160
innovation brilliant minds

4743
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:13,600
and in that sense doge is a kind of

4744
02:28:10,159 --> 02:28:17,039
fu to the system that's kind of positive

4745
02:28:13,600 --> 02:28:20,559
but also uh kind of uh

4746
02:28:17,040 --> 02:28:23,760
but it was also an fu so in that

4747
02:28:20,559 --> 02:28:25,439
sense i think elon has a perspective on

4748
02:28:23,760 --> 02:28:26,239
the world that's similar to bitcoin

4749
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:28,559
folks

4750
02:28:26,239 --> 02:28:29,520
which i really like which is like

4751
02:28:28,559 --> 02:28:31,600
thinking long

4752
02:28:29,520 --> 02:28:32,880
term it's how visionaries think it's

4753
02:28:31,600 --> 02:28:36,159
like how will

4754
02:28:32,879 --> 02:28:39,358
if i take these ideas what

4755
02:28:36,159 --> 02:28:42,239
and the ideas hold true

4756
02:28:39,359 --> 02:28:43,359
what will the world look like in 20 30

4757
02:28:42,239 --> 02:28:45,359
50 years

4758
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:46,399
and think about everything in that way

4759
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:49,920
yeah i like

4760
02:28:46,398 --> 02:28:53,439
bezos view which is uh is essentially

4761
02:28:49,920 --> 02:28:56,000
how do you minimize regret how do you

4762
02:28:53,439 --> 02:28:59,040
accelerate your life mentally and go to

4763
02:28:56,000 --> 02:29:00,478
80 90 100 150 years whatever we end up

4764
02:28:59,040 --> 02:29:02,399
being you know fortunate enough to live

4765
02:29:00,478 --> 02:29:04,079
to and then look backwards

4766
02:29:02,398 --> 02:29:06,318
yes and say this decision that i'm gonna

4767
02:29:04,079 --> 02:29:08,239
make i have two

4768
02:29:06,318 --> 02:29:10,079
options which one is going to be the one

4769
02:29:08,239 --> 02:29:11,840
that i least regret

4770
02:29:10,079 --> 02:29:13,120
and if you continue to make decisions

4771
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:14,880
that way

4772
02:29:13,120 --> 02:29:15,680
one you have that long-term view kind of

4773
02:29:14,879 --> 02:29:16,879
built in because you're working

4774
02:29:15,680 --> 02:29:19,280
backwards

4775
02:29:16,879 --> 02:29:20,239
two you are ultimately going to optimize

4776
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:23,600
for

4777
02:29:20,239 --> 02:29:26,239
minimal regret but also three is

4778
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:27,600
even if you only look for 10 years

4779
02:29:26,239 --> 02:29:28,159
that's much much further than most

4780
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:29,280
people do

4781
02:29:28,159 --> 02:29:31,520
and so it gives you a significant

4782
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:33,680
advantage and i think that um

4783
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:35,040
bitcoin has kind of this like um you

4784
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:38,800
know proxy for time

4785
02:29:35,040 --> 02:29:39,439
as we talked about inter-plant planetary

4786
02:29:38,799 --> 02:29:41,599
travel

4787
02:29:39,439 --> 02:29:43,439
where there's multiple steps from

4788
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:43,920
creating a reusable rocket to landing it

4789
02:29:43,439 --> 02:29:46,398
to

4790
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:48,478
you know all the stuff all the way to

4791
02:29:46,398 --> 02:29:49,840
simple things just like

4792
02:29:48,478 --> 02:29:51,119
if you're simply trying to figure out

4793
02:29:49,840 --> 02:29:52,478
where the world's going to be 30 years

4794
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:54,399
from now

4795
02:29:52,478 --> 02:29:56,000
you know bill gates says that we

4796
02:29:54,398 --> 02:29:59,519
overestimate what we can do in one year

4797
02:29:56,000 --> 02:30:02,639
underestimate what we can do in 10. well

4798
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:05,920
to me it's a kind of degree of

4799
02:30:02,639 --> 02:30:07,920
uh mistake if you will 10 years maybe

4800
02:30:05,920 --> 02:30:10,079
you're off by 10

4801
02:30:07,920 --> 02:30:11,840
well if that line of progress continues

4802
02:30:10,079 --> 02:30:14,799
20 years you may be off by

4803
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:15,600
100 and 30 years you may be off by a

4804
02:30:14,799 --> 02:30:17,920
thousand percent

4805
02:30:15,600 --> 02:30:20,479
right like almost the further you go out

4806
02:30:17,920 --> 02:30:23,840
the more inaccurate you become

4807
02:30:20,478 --> 02:30:25,840
and so i think that people who

4808
02:30:23,840 --> 02:30:27,200
want to iterate their way to success

4809
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:29,040
right that's a common thing in like the

4810
02:30:27,200 --> 02:30:32,079
startup world

4811
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:33,920
end up actually following

4812
02:30:32,079 --> 02:30:35,439
kind of the breadcrumbs to where the

4813
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:38,079
world is taking them

4814
02:30:35,439 --> 02:30:38,880
but people like an elon musk a jeff

4815
02:30:38,079 --> 02:30:40,719
bezos

4816
02:30:38,879 --> 02:30:42,799
a jack dorsey all the way down the line

4817
02:30:40,719 --> 02:30:45,039
all these innovators

4818
02:30:42,799 --> 02:30:46,000
they actually say to themselves there is

4819
02:30:45,040 --> 02:30:48,479
a point in time

4820
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:50,079
in the future where there's a world i

4821
02:30:48,478 --> 02:30:52,398
want to construct

4822
02:30:50,079 --> 02:30:53,840
and then they go and they construct it

4823
02:30:52,398 --> 02:30:56,239
regardless of

4824
02:30:53,840 --> 02:30:57,760
the short-term iterations and incentives

4825
02:30:56,239 --> 02:30:59,199
it is just they're driving towards that

4826
02:30:57,760 --> 02:31:00,880
point and i think that it's this whole

4827
02:30:59,200 --> 02:31:04,079
idea of having this like

4828
02:31:00,879 --> 02:31:04,879
you know kind of set vision and this uh

4829
02:31:04,079 --> 02:31:07,760
refusal

4830
02:31:04,879 --> 02:31:10,398
to kind of move or budge off of that

4831
02:31:07,760 --> 02:31:12,559
it's what makes them special

4832
02:31:10,398 --> 02:31:14,318
one of the things that garnered a lot of

4833
02:31:12,559 --> 02:31:17,439
excitement in the crypto

4834
02:31:14,318 --> 02:31:20,639
community is nfts i

4835
02:31:17,439 --> 02:31:22,880
i have no idea really the

4836
02:31:20,639 --> 02:31:24,959
depths the fundamental technological

4837
02:31:22,879 --> 02:31:27,119
philosophical depths of the second

4838
02:31:24,959 --> 02:31:28,478
of this technology whether this is just

4839
02:31:27,120 --> 02:31:30,479
like a little bit of a fad

4840
02:31:28,478 --> 02:31:32,159
or if there's some deep lessons to learn

4841
02:31:30,478 --> 02:31:33,438
whether it's bitcoin or cryptocurrency

4842
02:31:32,159 --> 02:31:35,439
in general about it

4843
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:38,559
do you have thoughts about like the long

4844
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:40,239
lasting fundamental aspects of nfts

4845
02:31:38,559 --> 02:31:43,119
i think there's probably both things

4846
02:31:40,239 --> 02:31:46,719
happening fad and things to learn

4847
02:31:43,120 --> 02:31:49,439
right and um if we just start with like

4848
02:31:46,719 --> 02:31:50,398
what is an nft it's a non-fungible token

4849
02:31:49,439 --> 02:31:52,079
meaning that

4850
02:31:50,398 --> 02:31:53,519
um there's no fungibility and

4851
02:31:52,079 --> 02:31:56,239
fungibility is a

4852
02:31:53,520 --> 02:31:57,520
fancy word i always describe it as if i

4853
02:31:56,239 --> 02:31:58,559
took a hundred dollar bill and i put it

4854
02:31:57,520 --> 02:31:59,840
on the table with a bunch of other

4855
02:31:58,559 --> 02:32:00,079
hundred dollar bills and we mixed them

4856
02:31:59,840 --> 02:32:01,439
up

4857
02:32:00,079 --> 02:32:03,840
and i just grabbed a hundred dollar bill

4858
02:32:01,439 --> 02:32:04,318
and left i'm no worse as long as they're

4859
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:06,000
all

4860
02:32:04,318 --> 02:32:07,840
you know uh official hundred dollar

4861
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:10,159
bills because as long as i have 100

4862
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:11,520
500 i don't need that exact same bill

4863
02:32:10,159 --> 02:32:13,280
back so that means that those hundred

4864
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:15,760
dollar bills are fungible

4865
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:17,520
non-fungible would be like art if i took

4866
02:32:15,760 --> 02:32:18,880
a picasso and i put it down on the table

4867
02:32:17,520 --> 02:32:20,239
and you brought three artists that no

4868
02:32:18,879 --> 02:32:20,719
one's ever heard of before and we mixed

4869
02:32:20,239 --> 02:32:22,159
them up

4870
02:32:20,719 --> 02:32:24,318
and i just took any random piece of art

4871
02:32:22,159 --> 02:32:25,680
it wasn't the picasso i lose because the

4872
02:32:24,318 --> 02:32:26,079
picasso is really important there right

4873
02:32:25,680 --> 02:32:28,720
so the

4874
02:32:26,079 --> 02:32:30,318
non-fungibility is important in art what

4875
02:32:28,719 --> 02:32:30,879
these non-fungible tokens essentially

4876
02:32:30,318 --> 02:32:35,039
are doing

4877
02:32:30,879 --> 02:32:38,239
is they are creating scarcity

4878
02:32:35,040 --> 02:32:40,960
and originality in a digital environment

4879
02:32:38,239 --> 02:32:42,000
and what i mean by that is um take a

4880
02:32:40,959 --> 02:32:44,079
music file

4881
02:32:42,000 --> 02:32:45,120
if i had a music file and you wanted it

4882
02:32:44,079 --> 02:32:47,280
you said send it to me

4883
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:49,359
i press send it essentially creates a

4884
02:32:47,280 --> 02:32:50,079
copy and you get one music file i get

4885
02:32:49,359 --> 02:32:51,200
another

4886
02:32:50,079 --> 02:32:52,559
we don't care you can listen to the

4887
02:32:51,200 --> 02:32:53,840
music i can listen to music we're super

4888
02:32:52,559 --> 02:32:57,199
happy

4889
02:32:53,840 --> 02:33:01,439
if i instead though have a digital file

4890
02:32:57,200 --> 02:33:03,200
that entire premise is based on scarcity

4891
02:33:01,439 --> 02:33:04,239
and i hit send and you get a copy and i

4892
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:05,600
keep the original or you get the

4893
02:33:04,239 --> 02:33:08,879
original i get a copy

4894
02:33:05,600 --> 02:33:11,680
there's a problem and so ultimately

4895
02:33:08,879 --> 02:33:12,959
what i think is playing out with nfts is

4896
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:15,200
it's a technology

4897
02:33:12,959 --> 02:33:17,039
regardless of where it plays out from

4898
02:33:15,200 --> 02:33:19,760
blockchains or

4899
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:20,880
what in communities or environments that

4900
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:25,040
just brings

4901
02:33:20,879 --> 02:33:26,639
true digital scarcity to the internet

4902
02:33:25,040 --> 02:33:28,240
and so naturally what do people do they

4903
02:33:26,639 --> 02:33:30,398
look at the legacy world and they say

4904
02:33:28,239 --> 02:33:31,840
well what's scarce there that has value

4905
02:33:30,398 --> 02:33:33,760
how do we bring that to the digital

4906
02:33:31,840 --> 02:33:34,239
world so art is a perfect example right

4907
02:33:33,760 --> 02:33:36,239
and

4908
02:33:34,239 --> 02:33:37,840
you know frankly last year i started to

4909
02:33:36,239 --> 02:33:40,239
look at this because it felt like this

4910
02:33:37,840 --> 02:33:43,840
was going to be really really big

4911
02:33:40,239 --> 02:33:45,840
and the conclusion i came to was

4912
02:33:43,840 --> 02:33:47,760
just as bitcoin is going to be bigger

4913
02:33:45,840 --> 02:33:49,280
than gold right the digital

4914
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:50,880
application of something is going to be

4915
02:33:49,280 --> 02:33:52,000
bigger than the analog application

4916
02:33:50,879 --> 02:33:54,159
the same thing is going to be true in

4917
02:33:52,000 --> 02:33:56,079
art the digital art world is going to be

4918
02:33:54,159 --> 02:33:57,600
bigger than the traditional art world

4919
02:33:56,079 --> 02:33:59,120
people think that sounds crazy at first

4920
02:33:57,600 --> 02:34:01,520
until you start to realize

4921
02:33:59,120 --> 02:34:02,399
it's very very similar the yard is more

4922
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:04,640
portable

4923
02:34:02,398 --> 02:34:06,398
it can be divisible right it's got a

4924
02:34:04,639 --> 02:34:07,439
larger demand market in terms of the

4925
02:34:06,398 --> 02:34:09,119
internet rather than an

4926
02:34:07,439 --> 02:34:10,639
auction right all this kind of stuff

4927
02:34:09,120 --> 02:34:13,760
when you display it

4928
02:34:10,639 --> 02:34:14,159
it can have motion and music and all of

4929
02:34:13,760 --> 02:34:15,760
these

4930
02:34:14,159 --> 02:34:17,280
aspects to it that are better than the

4931
02:34:15,760 --> 02:34:18,719
traditional art

4932
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:20,560
what the traditional art market has that

4933
02:34:18,719 --> 02:34:23,840
the digital art market has not had

4934
02:34:20,559 --> 02:34:26,879
is the narrative narrative-based world

4935
02:34:23,840 --> 02:34:30,000
scarcity kind of in a digital sense

4936
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:31,519
and so what i think the entire world

4937
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:33,359
is going through right now is an

4938
02:34:31,520 --> 02:34:34,479
exploration of how do we use this

4939
02:34:33,359 --> 02:34:37,600
technology

4940
02:34:34,478 --> 02:34:39,119
to create new things

4941
02:34:37,600 --> 02:34:41,120
frankly we're not going to be good at it

4942
02:34:39,120 --> 02:34:43,680
for a while and so

4943
02:34:41,120 --> 02:34:45,600
the only place i've really focused on is

4944
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:48,960
digital art itself

4945
02:34:45,600 --> 02:34:51,040
and i've always been interested in art

4946
02:34:48,959 --> 02:34:52,079
but i wasn't going to go buy a painting

4947
02:34:51,040 --> 02:34:53,840
and hang it on the wall

4948
02:34:52,079 --> 02:34:55,760
right in the sense of that's how i was

4949
02:34:53,840 --> 02:34:58,000
going to store value

4950
02:34:55,760 --> 02:34:59,359
what i find fascinating though is that i

4951
02:34:58,000 --> 02:35:01,439
now can take

4952
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:02,880
that concept which most of the

4953
02:35:01,439 --> 02:35:04,398
wealthiest people in the world

4954
02:35:02,879 --> 02:35:06,398
have a significant portion some you know

4955
02:35:04,398 --> 02:35:07,920
some people have 20 percent in terms of

4956
02:35:06,398 --> 02:35:10,959
you know number of billionaires

4957
02:35:07,920 --> 02:35:12,079
20 of their wealth is in art and you can

4958
02:35:10,959 --> 02:35:15,119
bring to this digital realm

4959
02:35:12,079 --> 02:35:16,799
which is much more um kind of natural to

4960
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:18,399
a digital native

4961
02:35:16,799 --> 02:35:20,159
and so the best way to know how to

4962
02:35:18,398 --> 02:35:22,799
describe the importance is

4963
02:35:20,159 --> 02:35:23,760
imagine a serial number being placed on

4964
02:35:22,799 --> 02:35:26,079
something

4965
02:35:23,760 --> 02:35:28,478
take the eiffel tower the only eiffel

4966
02:35:26,079 --> 02:35:30,879
tower that has value is the first one

4967
02:35:28,478 --> 02:35:31,840
every replica of it regardless of size

4968
02:35:30,879 --> 02:35:33,759
location

4969
02:35:31,840 --> 02:35:35,799
you know who made it where they sent it

4970
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:38,398
they have no value

4971
02:35:35,799 --> 02:35:40,000
eiffeltower001 is the most important and

4972
02:35:38,398 --> 02:35:41,279
so i think that's ultimately what we're

4973
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:43,840
starting to see here

4974
02:35:41,280 --> 02:35:45,359
and what we're looking at is probably

4975
02:35:43,840 --> 02:35:47,680
one percent of what it's going to grow

4976
02:35:45,359 --> 02:35:47,680
into

4977
02:35:47,760 --> 02:35:50,880
you're bullish on us you're saying it

4978
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:52,640
could grow into something for

4979
02:35:50,879 --> 02:35:54,239
one percent it could grow into something

4980
02:35:52,639 --> 02:35:55,199
significant like all kinds of different

4981
02:35:54,239 --> 02:35:56,879
applications

4982
02:35:55,200 --> 02:35:58,399
strip away all the applications right

4983
02:35:56,879 --> 02:35:59,679
now and just think about

4984
02:35:58,398 --> 02:36:01,199
is digital scarcity going to be

4985
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:02,479
important on the internet right moving

4986
02:36:01,200 --> 02:36:04,240
all the things that are scarce in the

4987
02:36:02,478 --> 02:36:05,840
physical world into digital space

4988
02:36:04,239 --> 02:36:08,239
us trying to figure out which things can

4989
02:36:05,840 --> 02:36:09,680
be moved and not and also there's things

4990
02:36:08,239 --> 02:36:11,439
in the digital space just like you're

4991
02:36:09,680 --> 02:36:12,079
saying that don't exist in the physical

4992
02:36:11,439 --> 02:36:15,439
world that

4993
02:36:12,079 --> 02:36:17,600
might also benefit from gaining scarcity

4994
02:36:15,439 --> 02:36:19,680
like you know people are i guess

4995
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:21,680
creating nfts out of like tweets

4996
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:23,280
or whatever so like you're you have you

4997
02:36:21,680 --> 02:36:25,200
have a fun twitter account

4998
02:36:23,280 --> 02:36:27,600
you know you could say like you could

4999
02:36:25,200 --> 02:36:29,920
put value to a single tweet and then be

5000
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:31,439
able to invest in it and trade it and

5001
02:36:29,920 --> 02:36:33,600
buy parts of it and all those kinds of

5002
02:36:31,439 --> 02:36:35,120
things you know you can invest in people

5003
02:36:33,600 --> 02:36:38,800
you can invest in

5004
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:41,840
you know art can be defined broadly as

5005
02:36:38,799 --> 02:36:42,318
any kind of creation right in in some

5006
02:36:41,840 --> 02:36:46,079
sense

5007
02:36:42,318 --> 02:36:47,840
this whole idea of scarcity can overtake

5008
02:36:46,079 --> 02:36:51,439
the entirety

5009
02:36:47,840 --> 02:36:55,040
of the digital world it can like consume

5010
02:36:51,439 --> 02:36:56,639
the all of the markets we see as

5011
02:36:55,040 --> 02:36:58,240
financial markets and just turn

5012
02:36:56,639 --> 02:37:01,119
everything into a market

5013
02:36:58,239 --> 02:37:01,600
well so if i if i take you on like a i

5014
02:37:01,120 --> 02:37:04,640
don't know

5015
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:05,840
10 year fast forward yeah and i paint a

5016
02:37:04,639 --> 02:37:07,439
picture of

5017
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:09,439
something today that seems absolutely

5018
02:37:07,439 --> 02:37:11,359
insane but there's early signs that

5019
02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:12,559
people are building this and let's just

5020
02:37:11,359 --> 02:37:14,079
give them the benefit of the doubt that

5021
02:37:12,559 --> 02:37:17,039
some of the early iterations will work

5022
02:37:14,079 --> 02:37:19,840
and some of or most of them won't

5023
02:37:17,040 --> 02:37:21,840
there's a world where you and i are

5024
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:25,200
participating in a digital economy

5025
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:26,318
in a virtual world where uh whether it

5026
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:28,960
is a piece of art

5027
02:37:26,318 --> 02:37:29,600
it is a digital sculpture it is a

5028
02:37:28,959 --> 02:37:32,719
digital

5029
02:37:29,600 --> 02:37:33,280
skin from a video game it is a digital

5030
02:37:32,719 --> 02:37:36,318
good

5031
02:37:33,280 --> 02:37:39,520
that we purchased somewhere online

5032
02:37:36,318 --> 02:37:40,799
and we bring it and we display it in a

5033
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:43,600
digital museum

5034
02:37:40,799 --> 02:37:44,318
or a virtual museum and so now all of a

5035
02:37:43,600 --> 02:37:46,720
sudden

5036
02:37:44,318 --> 02:37:47,439
you can charge people for entry you can

5037
02:37:46,719 --> 02:37:49,760
consign

5038
02:37:47,439 --> 02:37:51,280
digital goods it's the replication of

5039
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:53,840
what happens in the analog world

5040
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:55,760
now just in digital and when you do that

5041
02:37:53,840 --> 02:37:59,040
what you do is you take

5042
02:37:55,760 --> 02:38:00,478
the addressable markets of these assets

5043
02:37:59,040 --> 02:38:03,439
or these mechanisms

5044
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:05,279
and they explode in the digital realm

5045
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:08,559
and so now all of a sudden

5046
02:38:05,280 --> 02:38:10,479
how fast does the human race

5047
02:38:08,559 --> 02:38:11,760
accelerate when it comes to human

5048
02:38:10,478 --> 02:38:14,478
production

5049
02:38:11,760 --> 02:38:15,920
intelligence learning all in the digital

5050
02:38:14,478 --> 02:38:18,799
output

5051
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:21,520
let's just if i said to you 20 years ago

5052
02:38:18,799 --> 02:38:22,879
i'm going to give you a global education

5053
02:38:21,520 --> 02:38:24,960
it means i'm going to take you and i'm

5054
02:38:22,879 --> 02:38:26,839
going to physically move you

5055
02:38:24,959 --> 02:38:28,799
to geography after geography after

5056
02:38:26,840 --> 02:38:30,559
geography it's going to take time

5057
02:38:28,799 --> 02:38:31,599
it's going to take resources and

5058
02:38:30,559 --> 02:38:32,799
ultimately it's going to take lots of

5059
02:38:31,600 --> 02:38:35,040
effort

5060
02:38:32,799 --> 02:38:36,000
if i now said to you hey i'm going to

5061
02:38:35,040 --> 02:38:39,040
transport you

5062
02:38:36,000 --> 02:38:40,239
in this virtual world to multiple

5063
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:42,319
geographies

5064
02:38:40,239 --> 02:38:44,000
but you're going to experience it in

5065
02:38:42,318 --> 02:38:46,239
this virtual

5066
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:47,760
uh world and you're going to have

5067
02:38:46,239 --> 02:38:50,639
digital goods that you can take

5068
02:38:47,760 --> 02:38:52,398
from economy to economy or from location

5069
02:38:50,639 --> 02:38:53,840
to location

5070
02:38:52,398 --> 02:38:55,279
all of a sudden you may get maybe you

5071
02:38:53,840 --> 02:38:56,398
get 90 of that you don't get a hundred

5072
02:38:55,280 --> 02:38:58,000
percent of the same value we get ninety

5073
02:38:56,398 --> 02:39:00,959
percent of the value

5074
02:38:58,000 --> 02:39:02,719
but you can do it at a much faster pace

5075
02:39:00,959 --> 02:39:03,279
and so in a six month period you've

5076
02:39:02,719 --> 02:39:05,920
actually

5077
02:39:03,280 --> 02:39:06,640
made three times the progress than you

5078
02:39:05,920 --> 02:39:08,478
would have

5079
02:39:06,639 --> 02:39:10,159
if you had to do in the physical world

5080
02:39:08,478 --> 02:39:11,279
so that's where i think we're heading so

5081
02:39:10,159 --> 02:39:13,439
[Music]

5082
02:39:11,280 --> 02:39:15,040
so there's digital art being displayed

5083
02:39:13,439 --> 02:39:16,880
in the digital

5084
02:39:15,040 --> 02:39:20,000
museum and people are being charged for

5085
02:39:16,879 --> 02:39:21,759
access and perhaps we plug in our senses

5086
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:23,520
which means we start to operate more and

5087
02:39:21,760 --> 02:39:25,439
more in a virtual reality

5088
02:39:23,520 --> 02:39:27,120
augmented reality virtual reality way

5089
02:39:25,439 --> 02:39:29,840
with this digital world

5090
02:39:27,120 --> 02:39:30,479
and increasingly go into this world

5091
02:39:29,840 --> 02:39:33,680
basically

5092
02:39:30,478 --> 02:39:37,119
lived most of our productive and uh

5093
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:39,520
social lives in this digital world

5094
02:39:37,120 --> 02:39:41,280
and increasingly essentially create a

5095
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:44,159
simulation

5096
02:39:41,280 --> 02:39:44,960
uh where the biological basis is just

5097
02:39:44,159 --> 02:39:47,039
there to

5098
02:39:44,959 --> 02:39:49,279
sustain the brain that's used to operate

5099
02:39:47,040 --> 02:39:51,359
in the in the virtual world

5100
02:39:49,280 --> 02:39:53,359
uh taking us back to the original when

5101
02:39:51,359 --> 02:39:56,079
we started talking about war

5102
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:57,439
i wonder what conflict looks like in

5103
02:39:56,079 --> 02:39:59,520
that world

5104
02:39:57,439 --> 02:40:02,159
that uh the people who are born today

5105
02:39:59,520 --> 02:40:05,280
maybe will be fighting wars

5106
02:40:02,159 --> 02:40:07,039
in the space in in that museum world

5107
02:40:05,280 --> 02:40:09,200
in that digital world remember what i

5108
02:40:07,040 --> 02:40:12,720
said we're moving from a world

5109
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:15,200
of conflict surrounded and determined by

5110
02:40:12,719 --> 02:40:17,599
bombs bullets and soldiers to a

5111
02:40:15,200 --> 02:40:20,479
battlefield that is determined by

5112
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:21,760
war of information and cyber

5113
02:40:20,478 --> 02:40:24,799
capabilities

5114
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:27,920
and so in that virtual world is it

5115
02:40:24,799 --> 02:40:31,278
about death and destruction of

5116
02:40:27,920 --> 02:40:33,840
human life in the physical analog world

5117
02:40:31,279 --> 02:40:35,760
or will it become more important to

5118
02:40:33,840 --> 02:40:38,960
attack or defend

5119
02:40:35,760 --> 02:40:40,398
virtual property and virtual life and

5120
02:40:38,959 --> 02:40:42,478
you know some level of virtual

5121
02:40:40,398 --> 02:40:45,599
sovereignty

5122
02:40:42,478 --> 02:40:48,079
in my opinion the latter is more likely

5123
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:48,880
and so what you start to understand is

5124
02:40:48,079 --> 02:40:52,000
well

5125
02:40:48,879 --> 02:40:55,199
what do you truly value in your life

5126
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:56,398
is it the physical analog materialistic

5127
02:40:55,200 --> 02:41:00,240
consumptive

5128
02:40:56,398 --> 02:41:03,519
goods or is it virtual

5129
02:41:00,239 --> 02:41:06,719
and in many cases something as simple as

5130
02:41:03,520 --> 02:41:09,040
the ability to connect with somebody

5131
02:41:06,719 --> 02:41:10,398
is really important and so one of the

5132
02:41:09,040 --> 02:41:12,880
most disruptive

5133
02:41:10,398 --> 02:41:15,119
combative violent things that a country

5134
02:41:12,879 --> 02:41:18,239
may do to another country in the future

5135
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:18,240
simply take down the internet

5136
02:41:18,639 --> 02:41:23,199
and put people in isolation yeah i don't

5137
02:41:21,760 --> 02:41:24,960
need to physically harm you if i can

5138
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:27,840
psychologically harm you

5139
02:41:24,959 --> 02:41:29,759
i don't need to terrifying yeah i don't

5140
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:33,200
need to

5141
02:41:29,760 --> 02:41:34,960
actually convince you through

5142
02:41:33,200 --> 02:41:36,240
a monopoly on violence on physical

5143
02:41:34,959 --> 02:41:38,079
violence

5144
02:41:36,239 --> 02:41:39,600
what if i can psychologically change the

5145
02:41:38,079 --> 02:41:42,318
way you see the world

5146
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:42,880
through misinformation through all sorts

5147
02:41:42,318 --> 02:41:44,879
of

5148
02:41:42,879 --> 02:41:46,079
nefarious activities and i think that

5149
02:41:44,879 --> 02:41:47,358
you know the united states has been

5150
02:41:46,079 --> 02:41:49,680
struggling with this idea over the last

5151
02:41:47,359 --> 02:41:51,200
couple of years in the political arena

5152
02:41:49,680 --> 02:41:54,239
but what happens when it starts to come

5153
02:41:51,200 --> 02:41:56,399
to other aspects of our life

5154
02:41:54,239 --> 02:41:58,719
and i think it's very likely it's almost

5155
02:41:56,398 --> 02:42:01,599
obviously likely that we're moving into

5156
02:41:58,719 --> 02:42:01,599
the digital world

5157
02:42:02,079 --> 02:42:05,279
the one of the features of the digital

5158
02:42:04,799 --> 02:42:08,318
world

5159
02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:11,359
is that artificial intelligence systems

5160
02:42:08,318 --> 02:42:14,398
can operate with much more power and

5161
02:42:11,359 --> 02:42:16,559
a frictionless way in that world

5162
02:42:14,398 --> 02:42:18,159
currently as we understand it it's hard

5163
02:42:16,559 --> 02:42:20,318
to build robots

5164
02:42:18,159 --> 02:42:22,719
that operate at scale and do like

5165
02:42:20,318 --> 02:42:26,079
arbitrary large amount of impact

5166
02:42:22,719 --> 02:42:28,000
damage or positive in the physical world

5167
02:42:26,079 --> 02:42:29,840
it's much easier to do in the digital

5168
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:30,478
world do you have do you ever think

5169
02:42:29,840 --> 02:42:34,000
about

5170
02:42:30,478 --> 02:42:37,679
ai systems just swimming about

5171
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:40,079
uh doing extraordinarily powerful

5172
02:42:37,680 --> 02:42:42,398
destructive things in the digital world

5173
02:42:40,079 --> 02:42:44,239
is that something of a concern to you

5174
02:42:42,398 --> 02:42:46,079
or is this something into a very distant

5175
02:42:44,239 --> 02:42:48,799
future

5176
02:42:46,079 --> 02:42:49,439
i think a lot of artificial intelligence

5177
02:42:48,799 --> 02:42:52,478
is

5178
02:42:49,439 --> 02:42:54,720
uh in the name it's simply the

5179
02:42:52,478 --> 02:42:57,760
replication of human intelligence

5180
02:42:54,719 --> 02:43:00,799
at scale automated

5181
02:42:57,760 --> 02:43:02,478
and pr and program programmatic meaning

5182
02:43:00,799 --> 02:43:04,639
that

5183
02:43:02,478 --> 02:43:05,760
in the analog world you could go hire a

5184
02:43:04,639 --> 02:43:07,680
thousand employees

5185
02:43:05,760 --> 02:43:09,359
or in you know an amazon case hire

5186
02:43:07,680 --> 02:43:12,398
millions of employees

5187
02:43:09,359 --> 02:43:13,359
and set a mission or a goal and push

5188
02:43:12,398 --> 02:43:16,719
them to go do that

5189
02:43:13,359 --> 02:43:20,559
that requires recruiting retention

5190
02:43:16,719 --> 02:43:22,559
training resources all that stuff

5191
02:43:20,559 --> 02:43:23,680
in the virtual world or in this digital

5192
02:43:22,559 --> 02:43:25,439
economy

5193
02:43:23,680 --> 02:43:28,000
what if you can just program the

5194
02:43:25,439 --> 02:43:30,559
resources and gain the same leverage

5195
02:43:28,000 --> 02:43:31,920
and do it at scale and do it in a very

5196
02:43:30,559 --> 02:43:33,920
programmatic way

5197
02:43:31,920 --> 02:43:35,520
and then have them actually make

5198
02:43:33,920 --> 02:43:37,920
decisions

5199
02:43:35,520 --> 02:43:39,840
in a way that doesn't require you to

5200
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:42,719
have thought of every single

5201
02:43:39,840 --> 02:43:43,760
potential scenario or edge case that's

5202
02:43:42,719 --> 02:43:45,760
ultimately what we're talking about we

5203
02:43:43,760 --> 02:43:48,000
talk about artificial intelligence right

5204
02:43:45,760 --> 02:43:49,600
and so when you look at that when

5205
02:43:48,000 --> 02:43:52,398
technology's created

5206
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:53,439
everyone uses it for good or bad but

5207
02:43:52,398 --> 02:43:55,439
both get used

5208
02:43:53,439 --> 02:43:57,760
right and so whether we're talking about

5209
02:43:55,439 --> 02:44:00,559
cell phones beepers the internet

5210
02:43:57,760 --> 02:44:01,680
guns whatever it's always used for good

5211
02:44:00,559 --> 02:44:03,439
and bad

5212
02:44:01,680 --> 02:44:05,040
the big question is and i think that you

5213
02:44:03,439 --> 02:44:06,318
know yourself and many other people have

5214
02:44:05,040 --> 02:44:10,000
rightfully

5215
02:44:06,318 --> 02:44:13,119
said this is the question really becomes

5216
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:16,799
is the negative and nefarious

5217
02:44:13,120 --> 02:44:18,880
uses of this inadvertent potentially

5218
02:44:16,799 --> 02:44:20,239
or does it actually come from a

5219
02:44:18,879 --> 02:44:21,519
malicious person it's the intention

5220
02:44:20,239 --> 02:44:22,959
militias

5221
02:44:21,520 --> 02:44:24,560
and to me that's what i i don't know

5222
02:44:22,959 --> 02:44:25,679
enough you know much more about this and

5223
02:44:24,559 --> 02:44:26,559
there's plenty of other people who do as

5224
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:29,840
well

5225
02:44:26,559 --> 02:44:33,278
but i do think that there will be

5226
02:44:29,840 --> 02:44:34,239
nefarious actors and malicious people

5227
02:44:33,279 --> 02:44:35,439
but we're going to treat them the same

5228
02:44:34,239 --> 02:44:36,799
way we've always treated people who use

5229
02:44:35,439 --> 02:44:38,880
technology poorly

5230
02:44:36,799 --> 02:44:39,759
right we're going to understand it we're

5231
02:44:38,879 --> 02:44:41,039
going to identify it we're going to

5232
02:44:39,760 --> 02:44:41,359
control it and then we're going to end

5233
02:44:41,040 --> 02:44:42,960
up

5234
02:44:41,359 --> 02:44:45,520
reversing it or preventing that from

5235
02:44:42,959 --> 02:44:46,719
doing that it's the inadvertent things

5236
02:44:45,520 --> 02:44:47,680
that i think are actually the most

5237
02:44:46,719 --> 02:44:49,760
dangerous

5238
02:44:47,680 --> 02:44:51,760
because when you have something that can

5239
02:44:49,760 --> 02:44:54,719
think for itself

5240
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:56,079
and there is no way to leverage a

5241
02:44:54,719 --> 02:45:00,079
monopoly on violence

5242
02:44:56,079 --> 02:45:02,079
for control it's a very scary thing

5243
02:45:00,079 --> 02:45:03,200
and it can i mean the the thing that's

5244
02:45:02,079 --> 02:45:05,439
scary to me is that

5245
02:45:03,200 --> 02:45:07,520
it can scale arbitrarily so it can

5246
02:45:05,439 --> 02:45:12,479
outnumber humans very quickly

5247
02:45:07,520 --> 02:45:14,720
even if it's dumber than humans and so

5248
02:45:12,478 --> 02:45:16,879
i don't know if we're able to reason

5249
02:45:14,719 --> 02:45:19,278
about a world

5250
02:45:16,879 --> 02:45:21,519
like let's look at the physical analog

5251
02:45:19,279 --> 02:45:24,239
where all of a sudden

5252
02:45:21,520 --> 02:45:26,079
uh let's talk about something kind of

5253
02:45:24,239 --> 02:45:26,719
like humans but dumber than humans like

5254
02:45:26,079 --> 02:45:30,079
chimps

5255
02:45:26,719 --> 02:45:32,559
okay imagine that all of a sudden chimps

5256
02:45:30,079 --> 02:45:35,120
could multiply

5257
02:45:32,559 --> 02:45:35,920
arbitrarily quickly and you could have

5258
02:45:35,120 --> 02:45:39,040
like

5259
02:45:35,920 --> 02:45:41,040
a trillion chimps the next day

5260
02:45:39,040 --> 02:45:42,560
when when you only had maybe a million

5261
02:45:41,040 --> 02:45:45,520
the day before

5262
02:45:42,559 --> 02:45:46,478
like how does that world look different

5263
02:45:45,520 --> 02:45:49,439
where the [ __ ] did all these

5264
02:45:46,478 --> 02:45:51,278
chimps come from and they like and then

5265
02:45:49,439 --> 02:45:52,079
we can we can pretend to be like well

5266
02:45:51,279 --> 02:45:53,920
let's hope

5267
02:45:52,079 --> 02:45:55,680
the chimps like don't get violent

5268
02:45:53,920 --> 02:45:56,559
because they they don't seem to get

5269
02:45:55,680 --> 02:45:59,439
violent

5270
02:45:56,559 --> 02:46:01,278
when the resources aren't constrained

5271
02:45:59,439 --> 02:46:04,159
but like we don't know

5272
02:46:01,279 --> 02:46:05,359
and the problem is it all starts by

5273
02:46:04,159 --> 02:46:08,318
building that first

5274
02:46:05,359 --> 02:46:09,840
chip multiplier device and everyone's

5275
02:46:08,318 --> 02:46:11,680
like okay yeah there's a lot of good

5276
02:46:09,840 --> 02:46:14,559
applications you want

5277
02:46:11,680 --> 02:46:15,279
you know you can make all kinds of

5278
02:46:14,559 --> 02:46:17,760
arguments

5279
02:46:15,279 --> 02:46:19,520
for why you have more chimps maybe they

5280
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:20,398
can help you out around the house or

5281
02:46:19,520 --> 02:46:23,520
something like that

5282
02:46:20,398 --> 02:46:24,959
in the physical space but

5283
02:46:23,520 --> 02:46:27,200
ultimately it's the unintended

5284
02:46:24,959 --> 02:46:29,119
consequences that you're referring to is

5285
02:46:27,200 --> 02:46:31,439
you don't know what's gonna happen i'm

5286
02:46:29,120 --> 02:46:34,800
really worried about

5287
02:46:31,439 --> 02:46:37,760
dumb ai agents uh

5288
02:46:34,799 --> 02:46:38,719
like having impact when they're

5289
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:41,359
multiplied

5290
02:46:38,719 --> 02:46:44,559
to a million to a billion and are

5291
02:46:41,359 --> 02:46:47,200
allowed to operate in the digital space

5292
02:46:44,559 --> 02:46:48,079
especially as we clearly are moving more

5293
02:46:47,200 --> 02:46:52,240
and more

5294
02:46:48,079 --> 02:46:54,000
of our lives into the digital space so

5295
02:46:52,239 --> 02:46:55,760
it's kind of terrifying because we you

5296
02:46:54,000 --> 02:46:57,840
know a lot of people are terrified

5297
02:46:55,760 --> 02:47:00,000
or like concerned about super

5298
02:46:57,840 --> 02:47:02,079
intelligent systems

5299
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:03,200
i think i'm definitely much more

5300
02:47:02,079 --> 02:47:06,478
concerned about

5301
02:47:03,200 --> 02:47:07,359
super dumb systems at scale that that's

5302
02:47:06,478 --> 02:47:09,840
terrifying

5303
02:47:07,359 --> 02:47:11,279
i always think about um the inadvertent

5304
02:47:09,840 --> 02:47:12,318
but as you were talking what it made me

5305
02:47:11,279 --> 02:47:15,359
think of is

5306
02:47:12,318 --> 02:47:16,879
also the irreversible irreversible right

5307
02:47:15,359 --> 02:47:20,000
so it's one thing if there's

5308
02:47:16,879 --> 02:47:21,759
uh inadvertent negative impact

5309
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:24,079
but we have reversibility built into a

5310
02:47:21,760 --> 02:47:26,159
system and we can fix our mistakes

5311
02:47:24,079 --> 02:47:28,159
yeah i think the really scary part is

5312
02:47:26,159 --> 02:47:28,879
when you overlay inadvertent mistakes

5313
02:47:28,159 --> 02:47:32,318
with the

5314
02:47:28,879 --> 02:47:35,119
irreversible aspect of it and therefore

5315
02:47:32,318 --> 02:47:36,879
humans have no control yeah if you if

5316
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:39,359
you have the trillion chimps

5317
02:47:36,879 --> 02:47:43,199
you can't they're not gonna like it when

5318
02:47:39,359 --> 02:47:43,200
you try to start killing them off

5319
02:47:44,079 --> 02:47:51,520
uh all right but back to bitcoin

5320
02:47:48,559 --> 02:47:53,119
those chimps in the bitcoin community

5321
02:47:51,520 --> 02:47:54,960
anytime you bring up chimps

5322
02:47:53,120 --> 02:47:56,240
somebody will say joe rogan entered the

5323
02:47:54,959 --> 02:47:58,799
chat can i ask you

5324
02:47:56,239 --> 02:48:00,719
about sort of learning about bitcoin

5325
02:47:58,799 --> 02:48:04,079
books and resources do you have

5326
02:48:00,719 --> 02:48:05,920
an amazing podcast that's not just about

5327
02:48:04,079 --> 02:48:08,079
bitcoin or cryptocurrency it's about

5328
02:48:05,920 --> 02:48:09,520
everything including life but you do

5329
02:48:08,079 --> 02:48:12,079
have a lot of really amazing

5330
02:48:09,520 --> 02:48:15,520
conversations about this whole

5331
02:48:12,079 --> 02:48:16,000
world digital world but you oh obviously

5332
02:48:15,520 --> 02:48:18,399
you also

5333
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:20,079
have a newsletter that's incredible on

5334
02:48:18,398 --> 02:48:23,760
sub stack

5335
02:48:20,079 --> 02:48:23,760
and and um

5336
02:48:23,840 --> 02:48:27,359
but do you have recommendations maybe it

5337
02:48:26,079 --> 02:48:28,799
would be great if you could talk about

5338
02:48:27,359 --> 02:48:31,840
first of all your podcast

5339
02:48:28,799 --> 02:48:33,358
and the news newsletter but also other

5340
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:34,159
resources that you recommend people

5341
02:48:33,359 --> 02:48:37,200
should check out

5342
02:48:34,159 --> 02:48:39,920
in order to learn about bitcoin yeah so

5343
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:40,240
the podcasts and uh email are like the

5344
02:48:39,920 --> 02:48:42,079
two

5345
02:48:40,239 --> 02:48:43,920
most selfish things i do because the

5346
02:48:42,079 --> 02:48:44,639
podcast is a way for me to learn from

5347
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:46,799
other people

5348
02:48:44,639 --> 02:48:48,159
so i get them to come on and tell me all

5349
02:48:46,799 --> 02:48:49,119
the things they're thinking about and i

5350
02:48:48,159 --> 02:48:50,639
get asked some questions

5351
02:48:49,120 --> 02:48:52,160
what's it called by the way uh just a

5352
02:48:50,639 --> 02:48:55,439
pomp podcast

5353
02:48:52,159 --> 02:48:57,760
and so in doing that um it really

5354
02:48:55,439 --> 02:48:59,120
is informative for me and i think that

5355
02:48:57,760 --> 02:49:00,960
my whole goal is just like if i'm

5356
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:02,960
learning other people will be learning

5357
02:49:00,959 --> 02:49:05,199
and then the email i read it every

5358
02:49:02,959 --> 02:49:06,719
morning because it forces me to

5359
02:49:05,200 --> 02:49:08,479
collect my thoughts and actually

5360
02:49:06,719 --> 02:49:09,679
articulate them in somewhat of a

5361
02:49:08,478 --> 02:49:12,239
coherent way

5362
02:49:09,680 --> 02:49:13,520
and so it's just something that um is

5363
02:49:12,239 --> 02:49:14,719
like a practice that i probably would do

5364
02:49:13,520 --> 02:49:17,200
even if no one read it

5365
02:49:14,719 --> 02:49:19,358
and then by being able to publish it uh

5366
02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:21,040
what does it do it elicits you know

5367
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:22,079
both the good and bad responses and so

5368
02:49:21,040 --> 02:49:23,439
people will let me know if they think

5369
02:49:22,079 --> 02:49:24,719
i'm an idiot and they'll

5370
02:49:23,439 --> 02:49:27,040
usually not respond if they think that

5371
02:49:24,719 --> 02:49:28,398
it's something smart and so um those two

5372
02:49:27,040 --> 02:49:30,720
things are uh really

5373
02:49:28,398 --> 02:49:32,719
um educational for me and and i think

5374
02:49:30,719 --> 02:49:34,559
kind of forced me to uh to be able to

5375
02:49:32,719 --> 02:49:36,559
articulate a lot of ideas

5376
02:49:34,559 --> 02:49:38,079
but a lot of what i share or learn on

5377
02:49:36,559 --> 02:49:39,039
those things come from these other

5378
02:49:38,079 --> 02:49:40,719
resources so

5379
02:49:39,040 --> 02:49:42,399
i'm definitely subscribing people should

5380
02:49:40,719 --> 02:49:45,039
subscribe but what are

5381
02:49:42,398 --> 02:49:45,920
bitcoin resources books that you

5382
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:47,040
recommend

5383
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:49,439
i think you gotta start with bitcoin

5384
02:49:47,040 --> 02:49:52,080
standard uh that one to me feels like

5385
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:52,720
uh it really lays out the picture nicely

5386
02:49:52,079 --> 02:49:55,760
um

5387
02:49:52,719 --> 02:49:57,119
there is uh bitcoin uh money you can't

5388
02:49:55,760 --> 02:49:58,159
[ __ ] with uh it's written by our friend

5389
02:49:57,120 --> 02:50:00,079
jason williams

5390
02:49:58,159 --> 02:50:01,279
uh as you can imagine it's basically

5391
02:50:00,079 --> 02:50:03,359
what it talks about

5392
02:50:01,279 --> 02:50:05,040
uh there's another book layered money um

5393
02:50:03,359 --> 02:50:05,920
that's written by nick who uh who's done

5394
02:50:05,040 --> 02:50:08,640
a grant a

5395
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:09,359
great job kind of laying it out there's

5396
02:50:08,639 --> 02:50:11,199
a book

5397
02:50:09,359 --> 02:50:13,120
called bitcoin in black america written

5398
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:14,800
by a guy isaiah jackson

5399
02:50:13,120 --> 02:50:17,279
and he basically lays out the argument

5400
02:50:14,799 --> 02:50:19,840
for why the black community

5401
02:50:17,279 --> 02:50:21,200
can benefit in a asymmetric way from

5402
02:50:19,840 --> 02:50:22,719
something like bitcoin

5403
02:50:21,200 --> 02:50:24,319
um and there's a whole bunch more i'm

5404
02:50:22,719 --> 02:50:25,679
gonna forget them all

5405
02:50:24,318 --> 02:50:28,159
there's the uh i think it's called the

5406
02:50:25,680 --> 02:50:31,359
cost of tomorrow a guy uh jeff booth

5407
02:50:28,159 --> 02:50:32,639
uh jeff booth wrote it um and just

5408
02:50:31,359 --> 02:50:34,559
if you get on twitter basically you're

5409
02:50:32,639 --> 02:50:38,318
gonna see all these books flying around

5410
02:50:34,559 --> 02:50:40,879
um but i do have to say that uh from a

5411
02:50:38,318 --> 02:50:41,680
psychological concept uh or

5412
02:50:40,879 --> 02:50:43,438
philosophical

5413
02:50:41,680 --> 02:50:45,920
uh concept the number one book that i've

5414
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:47,040
ever read uh that aligns with bitcoin

5415
02:50:45,920 --> 02:50:47,840
ethos but doesn't say a word about

5416
02:50:47,040 --> 02:50:49,680
bitcoin

5417
02:50:47,840 --> 02:50:51,279
is a book called the dao of capital by

5418
02:50:49,680 --> 02:50:53,359
mark spitznagel

5419
02:50:51,279 --> 02:50:55,279
and so what he essentially does is he

5420
02:50:53,359 --> 02:50:56,000
just reiterates over and over and over

5421
02:50:55,279 --> 02:50:59,359
again

5422
02:50:56,000 --> 02:51:01,200
long-term thinking outliers disruption

5423
02:50:59,359 --> 02:51:02,559
all the stuff and so he's a guy who he

5424
02:51:01,200 --> 02:51:04,720
runs a fund

5425
02:51:02,559 --> 02:51:06,000
that essentially they just do uh tail

5426
02:51:04,719 --> 02:51:08,559
risk hedging

5427
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:09,760
and so in you know march or february of

5428
02:51:08,559 --> 02:51:12,639
2020

5429
02:51:09,760 --> 02:51:13,279
they're up like four thousand percent

5430
02:51:12,639 --> 02:51:15,840
right

5431
02:51:13,279 --> 02:51:16,319
by the way they pretty much lose money

5432
02:51:15,840 --> 02:51:18,239
you know

5433
02:51:16,318 --> 02:51:20,000
for eight nine years then that happens

5434
02:51:18,239 --> 02:51:20,799
and so uh

5435
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,719
but they're still one of the best

5436
02:51:20,799 --> 02:51:24,079
performing funds if you look at it over

5437
02:51:22,719 --> 02:51:25,760
you know years and years and so it's

5438
02:51:24,079 --> 02:51:28,159
just this mindset of

5439
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:29,520
uh everyone is so short-term focused and

5440
02:51:28,159 --> 02:51:31,439
so i think it's just a great reminder to

5441
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:34,399
long-term thinking

5442
02:51:31,439 --> 02:51:36,159
uh and also i mean i've gotten quite a

5443
02:51:34,398 --> 02:51:38,000
bit of value just reading the papers

5444
02:51:36,159 --> 02:51:39,920
that's perhaps more like for technical

5445
02:51:38,000 --> 02:51:40,959
folks there's quite an active research

5446
02:51:39,920 --> 02:51:42,478
community

5447
02:51:40,959 --> 02:51:44,239
and also going back to the original

5448
02:51:42,478 --> 02:51:46,799
white paper and just

5449
02:51:44,239 --> 02:51:47,359
original documents old school old school

5450
02:51:46,799 --> 02:51:50,239
still

5451
02:51:47,359 --> 02:51:50,640
uh what uh like what a few years ago

5452
02:51:50,239 --> 02:51:54,159
still

5453
02:51:50,639 --> 02:51:55,680
really interesting to think about

5454
02:51:54,159 --> 02:51:57,680
to look at what people were thinking

5455
02:51:55,680 --> 02:52:00,159
about because

5456
02:51:57,680 --> 02:52:02,159
the the principles are carried through

5457
02:52:00,159 --> 02:52:04,000
uh with uh other cryptocurrencies as

5458
02:52:02,159 --> 02:52:06,318
well like it's it's all

5459
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:07,359
it's all there even in the early

5460
02:52:06,318 --> 02:52:08,799
documents so

5461
02:52:07,359 --> 02:52:10,880
it's kind of fascinating to see that

5462
02:52:08,799 --> 02:52:11,920
whole history from if you're more like

5463
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:13,599
tech savvy

5464
02:52:11,920 --> 02:52:15,120
and like you said twitter is actually an

5465
02:52:13,600 --> 02:52:15,520
interesting place if you can look up

5466
02:52:15,120 --> 02:52:18,720
past

5467
02:52:15,520 --> 02:52:21,520
all the [ __ ] coin talk uh it's a it's a

5468
02:52:18,719 --> 02:52:23,519
fascinating place for news and resources

5469
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:24,960
is there books outside of all of this

5470
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:27,200
cryptocurrency sort of

5471
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:29,039
technical fiction philosophical that an

5472
02:52:27,200 --> 02:52:30,800
impact on your life

5473
02:52:29,040 --> 02:52:32,399
because you've you have interests that

5474
02:52:30,799 --> 02:52:33,759
are all over the place is there

5475
02:52:32,398 --> 02:52:36,879
something that um

5476
02:52:33,760 --> 02:52:38,159
you would recommend to others so doubt

5477
02:52:36,879 --> 02:52:39,039
capital is definitely probably my

5478
02:52:38,159 --> 02:52:42,398
favorite book

5479
02:52:39,040 --> 02:52:43,920
um books that have been impactful i read

5480
02:52:42,398 --> 02:52:45,680
when i was 20 actually sitting in the

5481
02:52:43,920 --> 02:52:47,520
desert of iraq um

5482
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:49,279
rich dad poor dad think and grow rich

5483
02:52:47,520 --> 02:52:51,920
and the richest man in babylon

5484
02:52:49,279 --> 02:52:52,560
and i don't think i took a single thing

5485
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:54,239
and like

5486
02:52:52,559 --> 02:52:57,119
implemented it from like an execution

5487
02:52:54,239 --> 02:53:00,239
standpoint uh but it was a complete

5488
02:52:57,120 --> 02:53:01,680
shift in mentality and understanding a

5489
02:53:00,239 --> 02:53:03,680
relationship with money

5490
02:53:01,680 --> 02:53:04,960
and just kind of what i wanted to do

5491
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:06,398
with my life and stuff like that so i

5492
02:53:04,959 --> 02:53:07,358
think those three books i read them in

5493
02:53:06,398 --> 02:53:09,519
succession

5494
02:53:07,359 --> 02:53:11,120
were really impactful um and then i

5495
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:11,680
think one of the best books probably

5496
02:53:11,120 --> 02:53:13,200
ever written

5497
02:53:11,680 --> 02:53:15,920
is uh i think it's called when breath

5498
02:53:13,200 --> 02:53:16,880
becomes air um or air becomes breath i

5499
02:53:15,920 --> 02:53:19,359
can't remember

5500
02:53:16,879 --> 02:53:20,478
uh but it's basically a doctor or a

5501
02:53:19,359 --> 02:53:23,359
medical professional

5502
02:53:20,478 --> 02:53:24,000
who's dying and he essentially writes

5503
02:53:23,359 --> 02:53:25,920
about

5504
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:27,520
the experience and thoughts and kind of

5505
02:53:25,920 --> 02:53:29,680
all the stuff and

5506
02:53:27,520 --> 02:53:31,120
i think that it's just one of these

5507
02:53:29,680 --> 02:53:32,639
things where if you said to me you know

5508
02:53:31,120 --> 02:53:35,040
what's the number one thing i took out

5509
02:53:32,639 --> 02:53:36,799
of my experience in iraq

5510
02:53:35,040 --> 02:53:38,640
that's a book like that also gives you

5511
02:53:36,799 --> 02:53:40,079
is we're all going to die

5512
02:53:38,639 --> 02:53:41,920
right and you and i can want to be as

5513
02:53:40,079 --> 02:53:42,639
immortal as we want but at some point

5514
02:53:41,920 --> 02:53:45,439
we're going to die

5515
02:53:42,639 --> 02:53:45,840
and so it really does kind of focus you

5516
02:53:45,439 --> 02:53:49,120
on

5517
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:51,520
time being that scarce asset and use it

5518
02:53:49,120 --> 02:53:52,880
for enjoyment and happiness

5519
02:53:51,520 --> 02:53:54,479
more so than anything else and i think

5520
02:53:52,879 --> 02:53:56,079
that's part of your message and it's a

5521
02:53:54,478 --> 02:53:57,599
great one

5522
02:53:56,079 --> 02:54:00,478
do you do you think do you like

5523
02:53:57,600 --> 02:54:02,640
literally meditate on your own mortality

5524
02:54:00,478 --> 02:54:03,920
i necessarily think i uh meditate on it

5525
02:54:02,639 --> 02:54:06,318
as much as um

5526
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:07,760
are you afraid of death were you afraid

5527
02:54:06,318 --> 02:54:09,359
of death when you're in iraq i mean if

5528
02:54:07,760 --> 02:54:11,600
you're coming face to face with it

5529
02:54:09,359 --> 02:54:12,720
are you afraid of death today no i i

5530
02:54:11,600 --> 02:54:14,960
think that it was just one of these

5531
02:54:12,719 --> 02:54:17,119
things where like

5532
02:54:14,959 --> 02:54:18,239
if you fixate on something and you worry

5533
02:54:17,120 --> 02:54:21,680
about it

5534
02:54:18,239 --> 02:54:24,719
then to at least to me like you become

5535
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:25,600
uneasy about it and so after an

5536
02:54:24,719 --> 02:54:28,559
experience

5537
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:30,159
like going to war i think that

5538
02:54:28,559 --> 02:54:32,398
everything is just

5539
02:54:30,159 --> 02:54:34,398
so not important compared to that right

5540
02:54:32,398 --> 02:54:36,079
like when i came back i remember

5541
02:54:34,398 --> 02:54:37,760
uh going back into the college

5542
02:54:36,079 --> 02:54:39,279
environment and like things people were

5543
02:54:37,760 --> 02:54:42,000
worried about i was like

5544
02:54:39,279 --> 02:54:43,840
listen let me explain to you you know

5545
02:54:42,000 --> 02:54:45,680
what the real world's like right

5546
02:54:43,840 --> 02:54:47,279
but i think even today right if you talk

5547
02:54:45,680 --> 02:54:48,639
to people who know me really well

5548
02:54:47,279 --> 02:54:50,640
i don't get worked up about a lot of

5549
02:54:48,639 --> 02:54:52,159
stuff i don't get you know in either

5550
02:54:50,639 --> 02:54:53,840
direction good or bad

5551
02:54:52,159 --> 02:54:55,200
uh anything because ultimately it just

5552
02:54:53,840 --> 02:54:58,719
comes down to

5553
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:59,279
if that's the final result let's enjoy

5554
02:54:58,719 --> 02:55:02,478
it

5555
02:54:59,279 --> 02:55:04,640
it's fascinating to ask you because this

5556
02:55:02,478 --> 02:55:08,159
reformulation of

5557
02:55:04,639 --> 02:55:11,599
money essentially buying time

5558
02:55:08,159 --> 02:55:16,079
and uh you know there's the old

5559
02:55:11,600 --> 02:55:20,399
question of does money buy happiness

5560
02:55:16,079 --> 02:55:22,239
do you think money can buy happiness

5561
02:55:20,398 --> 02:55:23,599
in the context of money being able to

5562
02:55:22,239 --> 02:55:26,478
buy time

5563
02:55:23,600 --> 02:55:29,120
or is happiness something else that is

5564
02:55:26,478 --> 02:55:30,879
beyond all of this

5565
02:55:29,120 --> 02:55:33,279
when people talk about this question i

5566
02:55:30,879 --> 02:55:35,039
think that they really focus on

5567
02:55:33,279 --> 02:55:36,880
money as a means to getting

5568
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:38,720
materialistic things

5569
02:55:36,879 --> 02:55:40,239
so they want a big house they want a

5570
02:55:38,719 --> 02:55:43,278
boat they want a fast car

5571
02:55:40,239 --> 02:55:44,398
they want you know whatever they think

5572
02:55:43,279 --> 02:55:45,680
that's the stuff that will make them

5573
02:55:44,398 --> 02:55:48,079
happy

5574
02:55:45,680 --> 02:55:49,279
what i think about it is if you have

5575
02:55:48,079 --> 02:55:51,520
resources

5576
02:55:49,279 --> 02:55:53,200
you can have time and if you have time

5577
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:54,239
and you spend it the way that you want

5578
02:55:53,200 --> 02:55:55,600
to spend it

5579
02:55:54,239 --> 02:55:56,719
then that's ultimately happiness so i

5580
02:55:55,600 --> 02:55:57,600
always say to people if you think that

5581
02:55:56,719 --> 02:56:00,079
money doesn't

5582
02:55:57,600 --> 02:56:01,279
buy you happiness what if i told you

5583
02:56:00,079 --> 02:56:04,000
that if you had more money you could

5584
02:56:01,279 --> 02:56:07,439
spend more time with your family

5585
02:56:04,000 --> 02:56:09,439
it reframes it yeah and now is all about

5586
02:56:07,439 --> 02:56:10,800
i want to do certain things in life but

5587
02:56:09,439 --> 02:56:11,600
there's a lot of people who spend their

5588
02:56:10,799 --> 02:56:14,799
life

5589
02:56:11,600 --> 02:56:15,680
not doing those things because they feel

5590
02:56:14,799 --> 02:56:19,599
the need to

5591
02:56:15,680 --> 02:56:21,840
pursue economic means as a way to

5592
02:56:19,600 --> 02:56:23,040
provide a living or whatever and so i

5593
02:56:21,840 --> 02:56:24,880
explained that i said listen

5594
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:26,640
in my opinion again it's my opinion it's

5595
02:56:24,879 --> 02:56:29,278
what makes me happy

5596
02:56:26,639 --> 02:56:31,599
if i can leverage financial resources to

5597
02:56:29,279 --> 02:56:35,120
create more time to do the things i like

5598
02:56:31,600 --> 02:56:36,640
i'm happier might not work for everybody

5599
02:56:35,120 --> 02:56:38,640
but like that's what works for me

5600
02:56:36,639 --> 02:56:39,760
and so there's this element of like i

5601
02:56:38,639 --> 02:56:41,278
don't care what other people think if

5602
02:56:39,760 --> 02:56:43,520
they like that or not because

5603
02:56:41,279 --> 02:56:44,720
they're not me right like like there's

5604
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:46,000
almost this element of like you got to

5605
02:56:44,719 --> 02:56:48,079
figure out what works for you and if it

5606
02:56:46,000 --> 02:56:50,239
works for me then like

5607
02:56:48,079 --> 02:56:51,600
no i think that resonates that will

5608
02:56:50,239 --> 02:56:53,840
resonate with a lot of people i think

5609
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:57,680
that's a brilliant reframing of it

5610
02:56:53,840 --> 02:56:59,520
that said you kind of imply there's a

5611
02:56:57,680 --> 02:57:01,200
there's a reason behind this whole

5612
02:56:59,520 --> 02:57:01,920
existence of ours there's a meaning to

5613
02:57:01,200 --> 02:57:04,000
it

5614
02:57:01,920 --> 02:57:04,960
so let me ask what is the meaning of

5615
02:57:04,000 --> 02:57:07,760
life

5616
02:57:04,959 --> 02:57:09,278
anthony do you think about these

5617
02:57:07,760 --> 02:57:10,960
ridiculous big questions

5618
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:12,720
that have no answer every once in a

5619
02:57:10,959 --> 02:57:14,398
while or do you just enjoy the [ __ ] out

5620
02:57:12,719 --> 02:57:17,438
of every day

5621
02:57:14,398 --> 02:57:17,840
i answer it in a way that um isn't meant

5622
02:57:17,439 --> 02:57:22,398
to be

5623
02:57:17,840 --> 02:57:24,478
accurate it's meant to um

5624
02:57:22,398 --> 02:57:25,439
be the right answer for me which is

5625
02:57:24,478 --> 02:57:27,119
ultimately

5626
02:57:25,439 --> 02:57:28,639
you know i talk to a lot of people who

5627
02:57:27,120 --> 02:57:30,160
always ask like what's the what are you

5628
02:57:28,639 --> 02:57:33,519
doing why are you doing this

5629
02:57:30,159 --> 02:57:34,879
it's to be happy and the reason why

5630
02:57:33,520 --> 02:57:36,399
i think of it that way is i've got a

5631
02:57:34,879 --> 02:57:37,679
friend jonathan geller who talks about

5632
02:57:36,398 --> 02:57:40,000
uh

5633
02:57:37,680 --> 02:57:41,600
you know enough being enough and

5634
02:57:40,000 --> 02:57:44,239
recently he talked about it in the

5635
02:57:41,600 --> 02:57:45,920
um context of bitcoin and so bitcoiners

5636
02:57:44,239 --> 02:57:47,119
are have two things any bitcoiner if you

5637
02:57:45,920 --> 02:57:47,680
talk to them they believe the same two

5638
02:57:47,120 --> 02:57:49,120
things one

5639
02:57:47,680 --> 02:57:50,559
they don't want the us dollar price to

5640
02:57:49,120 --> 02:57:51,600
go up because they actually want to

5641
02:57:50,559 --> 02:57:53,199
acquire more bitcoin

5642
02:57:51,600 --> 02:57:54,800
right and then like once they feel like

5643
02:57:53,200 --> 02:57:55,520
they've got enough but two is no matter

5644
02:57:54,799 --> 02:57:56,959
how much they only

5645
02:57:55,520 --> 02:57:58,560
think that they don't own enough and

5646
02:57:56,959 --> 02:58:02,639
they want to acquire more

5647
02:57:58,559 --> 02:58:05,119
and so at some point you say to yourself

5648
02:58:02,639 --> 02:58:06,639
what is enough and i think that the

5649
02:58:05,120 --> 02:58:09,920
whole meaning of life

5650
02:58:06,639 --> 02:58:12,318
is to understand kind of

5651
02:58:09,920 --> 02:58:13,840
what your level of satisfaction is and

5652
02:58:12,318 --> 02:58:15,359
for some people that's a monetary thing

5653
02:58:13,840 --> 02:58:15,840
some people that's a freedom of time

5654
02:58:15,359 --> 02:58:17,359
thing

5655
02:58:15,840 --> 02:58:19,600
for some people it's an impact thing

5656
02:58:17,359 --> 02:58:20,239
whatever but just understanding that's

5657
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:22,720
important

5658
02:58:20,239 --> 02:58:24,398
and then going and accomplishing it and

5659
02:58:22,719 --> 02:58:26,239
what i've found is that

5660
02:58:24,398 --> 02:58:27,680
the people who i know who have done this

5661
02:58:26,239 --> 02:58:29,359
and been intentional about it

5662
02:58:27,680 --> 02:58:31,120
they accomplish it on a much shorter

5663
02:58:29,359 --> 02:58:31,840
timeline than people who don't

5664
02:58:31,120 --> 02:58:34,079
right there's some people who start

5665
02:58:31,840 --> 02:58:34,960
thinking about when they're 60 well

5666
02:58:34,079 --> 02:58:36,159
naturally you're not going to accomplish

5667
02:58:34,959 --> 02:58:37,599
it before you're 60 if you start

5668
02:58:36,159 --> 02:58:38,879
thinking about it at 60.

5669
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:40,239
people who are thinking about it earlier

5670
02:58:38,879 --> 02:58:41,679
can do it and so i think that's really

5671
02:58:40,239 --> 02:58:43,119
it for me it's just like the meaning of

5672
02:58:41,680 --> 02:58:45,040
life is to enjoy it

5673
02:58:43,120 --> 02:58:46,319
the way i think about it that's because

5674
02:58:45,040 --> 02:58:48,399
it's a really nice formulation

5675
02:58:46,318 --> 02:58:51,359
i i almost like to sort of oscillate

5676
02:58:48,398 --> 02:58:53,039
back and forth so majority of the time

5677
02:58:51,359 --> 02:58:56,000
it's spent at the moment enough is

5678
02:58:53,040 --> 02:58:58,160
enough of gratitude

5679
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:59,840
basically being content with where

5680
02:58:58,159 --> 02:59:02,478
you're at like deeply appreciative of

5681
02:58:59,840 --> 02:59:04,239
every moment and all the bitcoin

5682
02:59:02,478 --> 02:59:05,039
whatever bitcoin you have being deeply

5683
02:59:04,239 --> 02:59:07,439
appreciative

5684
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:08,960
and that being enough and then some

5685
02:59:07,439 --> 02:59:10,720
fraction of time

5686
02:59:08,959 --> 02:59:12,159
perhaps it shrinks as you get older

5687
02:59:10,719 --> 02:59:13,438
that's maybe there's an optimal

5688
02:59:12,159 --> 02:59:16,318
trajectory there but

5689
02:59:13,439 --> 02:59:18,000
some fraction of time is spent being

5690
02:59:16,318 --> 02:59:19,840
like deeply self-critical

5691
02:59:18,000 --> 02:59:22,159
and nothing is enough nothing you've

5692
02:59:19,840 --> 02:59:24,239
ever done is worth anything it's the

5693
02:59:22,159 --> 02:59:25,520
marvel minsky said like the secret to

5694
02:59:24,239 --> 02:59:28,000
success

5695
02:59:25,520 --> 02:59:29,920
is hating everything you've ever done so

5696
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:31,840
like that mode of just hating

5697
02:59:29,920 --> 02:59:33,520
everything you've ever done and just

5698
02:59:31,840 --> 02:59:34,880
like trying to improve trying to make

5699
02:59:33,520 --> 02:59:37,359
stuff better

5700
02:59:34,879 --> 02:59:38,879
nothing's enough it's never enough that

5701
02:59:37,359 --> 02:59:39,840
kind of stuff and then oscillating back

5702
02:59:38,879 --> 02:59:41,119
and forth like

5703
02:59:39,840 --> 02:59:42,799
you don't have to have the same

5704
02:59:41,120 --> 02:59:44,399
algorithm operating throughout the day

5705
02:59:42,799 --> 02:59:44,959
you could just like oscillate back and

5706
02:59:44,398 --> 02:59:48,079
forth

5707
02:59:44,959 --> 02:59:50,000
and maybe reserve that gratitude part

5708
02:59:48,079 --> 02:59:51,439
the chill part to when you're hanging

5709
02:59:50,000 --> 02:59:52,079
out with family and friends and loved

5710
02:59:51,439 --> 02:59:54,398
ones

5711
02:59:52,079 --> 02:59:55,359
and then when you're like alone or maybe

5712
02:59:54,398 --> 02:59:57,358
a work

5713
02:59:55,359 --> 02:59:59,600
is that the madman comes out kind of

5714
02:59:57,359 --> 03:00:01,600
thing i also think it's um

5715
02:59:59,600 --> 03:00:03,600
kind of purpose driven in the sense of

5716
03:00:01,600 --> 03:00:06,559
there's a lot of people who have the

5717
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:08,318
uh i need to do more but in a somewhat

5718
03:00:06,559 --> 03:00:10,159
altruistic way

5719
03:00:08,318 --> 03:00:11,760
so they're you know take elon as an

5720
03:00:10,159 --> 03:00:15,520
example

5721
03:00:11,760 --> 03:00:18,159
the idea of colonizing mars

5722
03:00:15,520 --> 03:00:18,640
sure if he is successful he will be very

5723
03:00:18,159 --> 03:00:20,398
rich

5724
03:00:18,639 --> 03:00:22,239
i don't think you or i or many people

5725
03:00:20,398 --> 03:00:23,278
believe he's doing it for the money

5726
03:00:22,239 --> 03:00:24,559
right there's a lot of other things he

5727
03:00:23,279 --> 03:00:26,720
could do that'd be much easier that

5728
03:00:24,559 --> 03:00:30,959
would make him tons of money

5729
03:00:26,719 --> 03:00:33,679
and so in some weird way he has enough

5730
03:00:30,959 --> 03:00:34,879
because he's able to free himself from

5731
03:00:33,680 --> 03:00:37,680
the constraints

5732
03:00:34,879 --> 03:00:39,199
of i need to acquire more resources and

5733
03:00:37,680 --> 03:00:41,680
he can focus on what is the thing that i

5734
03:00:39,200 --> 03:00:44,640
want to work on regardless of money

5735
03:00:41,680 --> 03:00:45,680
and so in that pursuit that is

5736
03:00:44,639 --> 03:00:47,680
non-economic

5737
03:00:45,680 --> 03:00:49,680
you can be as selfish as you want

5738
03:00:47,680 --> 03:00:50,960
because ultimately you're not tied back

5739
03:00:49,680 --> 03:00:53,840
to

5740
03:00:50,959 --> 03:00:54,239
this like measurement tool and so it's

5741
03:00:53,840 --> 03:00:57,600
this

5742
03:00:54,239 --> 03:00:59,520
uh again like altruistic non-monetary

5743
03:00:57,600 --> 03:01:00,399
purpose and i think that there's a lot

5744
03:00:59,520 --> 03:01:01,359
of people who spend their whole life

5745
03:01:00,398 --> 03:01:02,879
looking for that and they don't know

5746
03:01:01,359 --> 03:01:05,600
what it is

5747
03:01:02,879 --> 03:01:06,000
and so again some people may not think

5748
03:01:05,600 --> 03:01:07,920
of it that

5749
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:09,040
way but if you can find something to do

5750
03:01:07,920 --> 03:01:11,279
that

5751
03:01:09,040 --> 03:01:13,680
you win i don't think there's a better

5752
03:01:11,279 --> 03:01:15,279
way to end it anthony i'm a huge fan

5753
03:01:13,680 --> 03:01:16,720
