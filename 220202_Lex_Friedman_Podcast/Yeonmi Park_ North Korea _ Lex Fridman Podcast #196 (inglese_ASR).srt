9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
in the description

10
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:22,960
to support this podcast let me say a few

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,399
words about north korea

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,439
from 1994 to 98 north korea went through

13
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,799
a famine

14
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,759
mass starvation caused primarily by king

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,840
jong-il

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,800
who at the time was the new leader of

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,680
north korea

18
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:38,640
after his father's death in 1994

19
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,640
somewhere between

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,600
600 000 and 3 million people

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,439
died due to starvation from all the

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,160
stories of famine in history

23
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,359
including my own family history i've

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,558
come to understand

25
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,479
that hunger tortures the human mind

26
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,640
in a way that can break everything we

27
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:01,119
stand for in north korea

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,120
during the 90s famine many were driven

29
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:05,759
to cannibalism

30
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:07,920
imagine more than 10 million people

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,439
suffering starvation for months

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,040
and years always on the brink of death

33
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,279
we don't know the exact numbers of

34
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,880
people who died because the suffering

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,079
was done in silence

36
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,959
in darkness very little information in

37
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,400
or out most people had to survive

38
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:26,798
without electricity

39
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,920
without clean water medical supplies

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,720
sanitation

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,759
and food the north korean propaganda

42
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:34,000
machine called this

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,959
the arduous march or the march of

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
suffering

45
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:39,118
and words such as famine and hunger were

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,159
banned because they implied government

47
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,599
failure

48
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,840
and once again now in 2021

49
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,759
kim jong-un the current leader of north

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
korea is calling for his country to

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,280
prepare for another arduous march

52
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,479
or march of suffering another period of

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,359
mass starvation

54
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,840
as the country closes its borders

55
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:00,078
looking

56
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,320
at atrocities of the past decades and

57
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,919
the encroaching atrocity there now

58
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,758
i think about the quiet suffering of

59
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,840
millions of north koreans

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:08,878
i think about the torture of the human

61
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,120
spirit

62
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,239
i think about a north korean child who

63
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,680
could be a scientist

64
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,959
an artist a writer but who instead grows

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
impossibly thin

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:22,719
without food their bodies slowly rotting

67
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,439
away as their parents watch helplessly

68
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:26,959
i got emotional in this conversation

69
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,639
with you on me

70
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:31,680
in part because i remembered my

71
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:34,079
grandmother who survived khaldamur

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,519
the famine in ukraine intentionally

73
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,840
created by stalin

74
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,560
where 4 to 10 million people died and

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,680
many

76
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,598
many more suffered imagine knowing that

77
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,840
if you don't engage in cannibalism

78
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:46,639
you will die before your children did

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,920
and then

80
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,399
they will be eaten imagine because of

81
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,079
this

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,039
deciding to murder and eat your own

83
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,560
children as many people did

84
00:02:55,039 --> 00:03:01,359
imagine the kind of desperation torture

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,199
that leads up to a decision like that

86
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,080
i'm not smart enough to know what evil

87
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,839
is

88
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,120
know where to draw the line between good

89
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,120
and evil

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,840
but stalin king jong-il kim jong-un

91
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,640
are men who are in the name of power are

92
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,840
willing to make

93
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,158
millions of people of children suffer

94
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,479
and die from starvation

95
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,679
i rarely have hate in my heart but i

96
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,560
hate these men

97
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,360
i hate that such men exist in this world

98
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,759
i hate

99
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,560
that the beauty i love about this life

100
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:34,000
exists

101
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,479
amidst such unimaginable cruelty

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,519
i have been haunted by this conversation

103
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,759
by memories of my grandmother's pain

104
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,360
but i've also been warmed by memories of

105
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:46,399
her love

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,799
love gives me hope hope for the

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,920
perseverance of the human spirit

108
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,480
even in the face of evil

109
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,000
this is the lex friedman podcast and

110
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,518
here is my conversation

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,360
with yomi park can you tell your story

112
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,840
from north korea to today as you

113
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,239
describe in your 2015 book

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,840
and with the extra perspective on life

115
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,560
love and freedom you've gained since

116
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,840
then

117
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,360
wow that's a long story so i was born in

118
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,719
the northern part of north korea

119
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,000
initially

120
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:21,199
and my father was a party member

121
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,800
and my mom was housewife i had a one

122
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,280
order sister

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,478
and i remember born in that country i

124
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,599
never thought i was

125
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,560
in an unusual country now i'm thinking

126
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,960
of what it is like

127
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,918
literally called the hermit kingdom but

128
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,399
i thought

129
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,758
i believed that i was living in the best

130
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:40,399
country on earth

131
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,600
it was a socialist paradise and

132
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:43,519
everybody

133
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,120
in the rest of the world worshipped my

134
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,478
idea leader

135
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:52,079
and there was nothing to envy for me

136
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:54,719
so i had this enormous pride in my heart

137
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,079
and grateful to be in that country so

138
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,000
was love for the leader not

139
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:02,399
fear for me at least it was love

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,918
yeah it was all the moderation and

141
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:07,359
gratitude

142
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:10,719
it changed lately but for me was pure

143
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,319
pure like love was there any

144
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,240
like looking back with the perspective

145
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,879
you have now

146
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,079
would you describe some of those moments

147
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:22,000
growing up

148
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:25,120
as full of happiness or was that

149
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,839
delusion at the time so not knowing the

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,639
alternative

151
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,239
will you still be able to be happy the

152
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,160
fact that i did not know

153
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,879
like in north korea this is the only

154
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,400
country in this 21st century has no

155
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,800
internet

156
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,159
and they don't even know the existence

157
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,400
of internet

158
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
not only that we don't even have this 20

159
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:46,399
like like

160
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,959
you know 24-hour electricity yeah so not

161
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,000
knowing

162
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:53,198
definitely helped i think to be sane

163
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,959
so as a human being you're still able to

164
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,000
find moments of happiness

165
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:00,079
i think my happiness was from family

166
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,680
nothing else even though those they was

167
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,719
keep telling me that they were

168
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,079
our source of meaning and happiness i

169
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,160
don't think i ever got

170
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,000
happy by that maybe they're here and

171
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,439
they're in schools and like when i was

172
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,918
learning propaganda

173
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,439
like you know the proud feeling right i

174
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:17,120
mean the greatest nation

175
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,719
here and there but like actually true

176
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,439
happiness came from

177
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,919
laughing with my family and my friends

178
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:26,879
are there any childhood memories

179
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:29,359
pleasant or painful ones that stand out

180
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:29,360
do you know

181
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,360
i mean like you know whenever i think

182
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,839
about my

183
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,120
north korea the interesting is there's

184
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,279
no color

185
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,280
i mean one is because north korean

186
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:42,638
country has no color right most of

187
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:45,679
things are unpaved

188
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,439
and trees all cut down we have no fear

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:52,000
so people cut down trees to make food

190
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:54,319
so but only that like even what we were

191
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,598
wearing was like no color

192
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,080
so it's um interesting like memory to

193
00:06:57,598 --> 00:07:01,038
look back what about fashion i've

194
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,159
noticed from

195
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,759
sort of uh you now you're you're

196
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,759
you have quite an incredible sense of

197
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,919
fashion so

198
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,120
contrast that with your time in north

199
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,120
korea how do you remember

200
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,879
fashion just or ways that people could

201
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,478
express themselves visually

202
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,918
was it all bland there was no word for

203
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:21,918
fashion in north korea

204
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,000
we didn't even know it was not even our

205
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:26,399
dictionary so of course i did not know

206
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,639
what victoria secret motors were i

207
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,478
didn't even know what motors were so

208
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,280
when i came out i learned

209
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,120
more there was a job and like what is

210
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:38,000
that and i'm still confused

211
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,720
so there's so many jobs that we have

212
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,439
here doesn't exist in north korea

213
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
what was life like in north korea as

214
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,038
compared to the rest of the world so

215
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,080
maybe you said there's no internet

216
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:53,038
uh 24-hour electricity

217
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,439
is a luxury you do not have what about

218
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:56,240
food

219
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,959
what about water what about basic human

220
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,478
rights

221
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,560
i think that's the thing like when

222
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,120
people were asking me can you tell me

223
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,759
about

224
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,560
like life in north korea and in the past

225
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,720
i was like

226
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,399
i cannot describe it to you and

227
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
initially i thought oh because of my

228
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:13,279
english that i cannot find the words

229
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,199
it's not that it's a different planet

230
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,239
the common sense that we have doesn't

231
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,478
exist there

232
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,840
like people literally do not know the

233
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,758
concept of

234
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:27,758
romantic love or human rights or liberty

235
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:30,319
so when i'm thinking back to my country

236
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,200
it's uh you know like as you cannot

237
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,519
imagine your life on mars right now

238
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,919
it's like that kind of difference i grew

239
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,560
up never seen the map of the world

240
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:41,278
i never knew that i was asian like the

241
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,359
regime told

242
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:44,799
me that i was keemer's son the first

243
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,120
king race

244
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,799
and then our calendar doesn't begin when

245
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,759
jesus christ was born

246
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,159
our candor begins where hymns was born

247
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:54,799
so

248
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:55,439
we and history was forgotten to us they

249
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:58,240
didn't touch

250
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,560
us about of course christianity or like

251
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,000
the

252
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:03,119
big bang like our history began when kim

253
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,240
was born

254
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,480
so everything was forgotten to us and

255
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,480
it was like different meaning i mean

256
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,639
feeling of existence

257
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,159
you know it's not even like the same

258
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,039
life i literally think

259
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,799
that was almost like my past life and

260
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,159
this is like a new life that i began

261
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:22,240
you're you're almost like a different

262
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:25,919
human being now absolutely

263
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,039
yeah so you've uh i have to say

264
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:31,199
i often say that my favorite book is

265
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,079
animal farm by george orwell

266
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,000
i've read it i don't know how many times

267
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,639
and so i was really happy to

268
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,080
hear that that was uh of the many books

269
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:41,679
excellent books they

270
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,759
will hopefully talk about you've

271
00:09:41,679 --> 00:09:45,039
mentioned that an animal farm had a big

272
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,240
impact on you

273
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:51,360
it was the book that kind of

274
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,080
uh led to uh a kind of awakening for you

275
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,278
maybe

276
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,040
can you describe what impact it had so

277
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,039
after going to what i went through right

278
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:00,559
and i arrived in south korea after many

279
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,399
years of journey

280
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,559
they were saying so kim's were dictators

281
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,919
and south korea is not colonized by

282
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,759
american investors

283
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,120
and americans first of all not bastards

284
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:12,559
they're good people

285
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,399
and then they say everything that you

286
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:17,919
believed in north korea was a lie

287
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,639
it was a propaganda then at 15 i was

288
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,479
thinking

289
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,639
so if everything that i believe was a

290
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,240
lie how do i know what you're telling me

291
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,039
it's not like

292
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,320
that was so hard how do i trust ever

293
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:31,519
again

294
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,920
and i just it was chaos and belief right

295
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,078
i did not know what was true anymore

296
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,958
and that's the moment few years later i

297
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,000
read this book

298
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:41,599
like animal farm just by mistake it was

299
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,240
a very short book in the library i was

300
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,600
like okay i can finish that quickly

301
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,720
and when they're ending that like last

302
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,360
chapter right they

303
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,399
could not see between the pigs and

304
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,759
humans anymore like that sentence

305
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,000
i just understood everything what

306
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,559
happened i just it made

307
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
every sense to me what happened to me my

308
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:05,199
people

309
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,320
and to my country yeah that there's uh

310
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,800
there's so many things they could say

311
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,600
about that book yeah there's a haunting

312
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,319
nature

313
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
to the young and i guess spoiler alert

314
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,640
but you should have read this

315
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,680
already if you're listening to this um

316
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,278
at the end the animals were looking to

317
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,719
the humans

318
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,240
and to the pigs and they couldn't see

319
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,200
the difference and then there's this

320
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,720
kind of

321
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:32,720
gradual transition

322
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,519
from the initial revolutionary steps

323
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,639
of animals fighting for their freedom to

324
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,399
slowly

325
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:44,480
uh the pigs gaining control went from

326
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,919
four legs good two legs bad two uh

327
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,000
four legs good two legs better

328
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,039
even better i think yeah like that they

329
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,440
were so like

330
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,599
gradually transitioning the ideology

331
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,519
under which the farm operates

332
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:01,759
and i think the gradual nature of that

333
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,799
where basically you have generations

334
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:06,879
born not

335
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:09,759
knowing how things were in the past

336
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:10,879
and that's that's what makes the most

337
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:15,039
kind of for me

338
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:19,600
haunting transition from freedom

339
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:22,159
to slavery to suffering to injustice

340
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,000
all those things and the animals don't

341
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:27,360
know they're part of that

342
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,440
and also for me personally

343
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,399
i've always kind of found a kinship with

344
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,440
boxer the

345
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,278
the horse because i just i'm kind of an

346
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,839
idiot i just work really hard

347
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,838
to work hard and i just love the idea of

348
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:44,560
working hard for an ideal

349
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:48,000
mm-hmm and the tragic nature of

350
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:48,958
to the end that horse boxer working his

351
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,159
ass off

352
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:54,638
for for the pride uh

353
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,679
for others uh but yeah for the pride of

354
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,399
the farm you know

355
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:02,559
uh and then the the the pigs

356
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,078
giving him sort of using that but then

357
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:04,958
just sending him to the slaughterhouse

358
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:07,278
anyway

359
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:09,039
when he was no longer useful i mean

360
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:10,639
there's so many tragic elements that

361
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,838
echo everything i've seen in the soviet

362
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,240
union

363
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,959
and many of the elements that you see in

364
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,240
even

365
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:19,838
harsher more drastic way in north korea

366
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,440
if there's something hopeful you pull

367
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,519
from that book

368
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,279
like within the suffering within the

369
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,799
gradual decline

370
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:29,278
the taking away the freedom there were

371
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:32,719
still moments of beauty it seemed like

372
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:35,278
it can be but i think for me was

373
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,480
when i was ending the last page of the

374
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,799
book

375
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,000
until that point i was angry towards a

376
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:41,919
dictator

377
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,198
why do you do this as a human being i

378
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:45,599
was so angry

379
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:48,319
dreaming of killing him revenging my

380
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,800
father the people that he cared but when

381
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,199
i was ending the last chapter

382
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:55,838
actually everybody was responsible to

383
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:58,399
create this dystopia in my country

384
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,680
that animals initial animals that when

385
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,320
they're scared

386
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,239
when they receive the first execution

387
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,240
and then they were not doing their job

388
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,759
speaking out and keep questioning

389
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,839
like they had a question and then they

390
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,399
as soon as they feel fear

391
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,600
they silence yeah because of that like

392
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,360
that's when i was like

393
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,800
my grandma knew life could be different

394
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,399
i think the one thing about north

395
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,559
koreans are unique is that

396
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,399
they don't know they're oppressed they

397
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:25,838
don't know that they are slaves to the

398
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,278
dictator

399
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,040
and the fact that other people know

400
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:30,480
they're oppressed like in america a lot

401
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:32,399
of people think they are oppressed

402
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,959
like you are not oppressed you don't

403
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,120
even know the definition of oppression

404
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,399
and like that's like when the new

405
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,879
animals came

406
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,240
the new animals didn't even know what

407
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:43,919
the life could be like

408
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,360
there's no alternative for them to

409
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,319
compare even

410
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,079
and i was like my grandmother knew why

411
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,519
didn't they not do anything about it and

412
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:54,879
they were just scared they kept

413
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:57,519
silent and everybody was responsible

414
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,639
so the people who knew were too afraid

415
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,600
to say

416
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,399
and then there's people that just didn't

417
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,720
even know

418
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,440
and i don't know what's more terrifying

419
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,680
about

420
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,800
human nature looking at this group of

421
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,559
people who are

422
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,639
afraid to say that things could be

423
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,799
otherwise and then the group of people

424
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,079
that

425
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:20,639
don't even know it could be better no

426
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,919
it's uh i don't know that this is that's

427
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,039
the reason i've returned to that book

428
00:15:21,919 --> 00:15:26,719
often because it's such maybe because

429
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:29,278
it's interesting using animals to

430
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,120
represent ideas that were very human

431
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,320
it almost allows you to explore the

432
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,320
darkness of human nature

433
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,078
without sort of being uh broken by it so

434
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,559
you mentioned anger when i watch your

435
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:45,359
interviews

436
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,559
you're really calm and collected not

437
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,159
just your interviews

438
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:51,919
you know instagram the way you present

439
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,919
yourself you um

440
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,839
i don't know it seems like you're almost

441
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,799
at peace with the world

442
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,079
um is there in private times when you're

443
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,958
just angry

444
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:04,559
do you feel fear do you go to dark

445
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:06,799
places depression

446
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,039
all those kinds of things are are you

447
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:11,439
able to put that world that you were in

448
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,000
behind you

449
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,600
it's a joke because i talk about north

450
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,720
korea every single day

451
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,639
and i still rescue people like from

452
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,000
china and russia and other countries

453
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,079
right and sometimes

454
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,600
our rescue mission fails and they get

455
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:27,838
capture and send back

456
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,440
i still have uh people in north korea

457
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,399
report to me

458
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,680
so like when i talk to my sister who

459
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,879
chose to not

460
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,479
be in this life activist life she forgot

461
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,159
most of things

462
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,519
and like for the other hand i like

463
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:45,039
remember everything

464
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,159
so sometimes it's uh it's it's a

465
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,198
blessing to

466
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,159
keep reminded of how because it's you

467
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,519
know they say

468
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:55,519
happiness relative thing it is sometimes

469
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,360
i mean a good thing is also people say

470
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,879
because nobody was fooling

471
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,360
when you're growing up everybody was

472
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:04,000
suffering you should have been okay

473
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,439
right but know like if you are suffering

474
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,279
that degree

475
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,959
no matter even if there's no comparison

476
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,558
like if you're in nazi german

477
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,078
in a holocaust right in the in the

478
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:14,480
concentration camp

479
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,198
i'm sure nobody was better than them i'm

480
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,078
sure they were

481
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,279
suffering is the same thing i suffered

482
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,078
but now because i'm

483
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:23,918
in this place i can compare easily right

484
00:17:22,078 --> 00:17:25,918
getting that perspective

485
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,839
but it is true like i still have days

486
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,799
that i cannot get out of bed

487
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:32,639
and i'm really hoping like that where it

488
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,079
was elam was talking about downloading

489
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,960
your brain blah blah

490
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:38,720
yeah like if maybe technology develops

491
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,440
that i can download some part of my

492
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,360
memory

493
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,480
and then i can erase it like when was i

494
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,959
deleted

495
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,640
and that would be so much better what i

496
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,200
this is uh

497
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,280
sorry for the tough question but if i

498
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,120
came to you if elon

499
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,399
came to you and said we can erase that

500
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:58,159
part of your memory

501
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,960
would you do it some days i would do it

502
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,960
for sure

503
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,240
and my mom would do a hundred percent my

504
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,480
sister would do it

505
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,160
all other defectors know they do a

506
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,679
hundred percent

507
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,400
for me i hesitated because i'm a witness

508
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,480
so if i delete that part i don't know

509
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,600
how real that can be

510
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,400
but it is painful like after i talk

511
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,000
give a speech right i mean i'm fine but

512
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,000
somehow i'm depressed

513
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,160
sometimes if the talk was very intense

514
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,400
i'm like depressed for three weeks

515
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,400
it takes a while for me to be recharged

516
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,679
but i don't know why it is you know

517
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,000
yeah i i just don't know yeah

518
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:37,759
well there's also the and uh there's a

519
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,160
guy named victor franco who wrote the

520
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,640
book

521
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,880
masters for meaning and there's some

522
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,480
aspect um

523
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,400
where so he talks about the holocaust

524
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,000
and you can in the in those moments of

525
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,720
suffering still discover meaning

526
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,079
still discover happiness in the simplest

527
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,558
of joys

528
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:56,079
like while starving you know a little

529
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,519
piece of bread could be a source of

530
00:18:56,079 --> 00:19:01,119
incredible joy yeah and there's some

531
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,079
aspect

532
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:05,759
in which that experience gives you a

533
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,639
clarity about the world

534
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,640
like somehow experiencing suffering

535
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,799
allows you to deep

536
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,759
deeply experience joy yeah and love

537
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,679
and also empathize with the suffering of

538
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:22,400
others and like it's almost like

539
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,600
brings you closer to other humans so

540
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:27,919
it's

541
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:31,519
this double-edged sword that um

542
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:34,720
that the highest of joys sometimes

543
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,918
are catalyzed by suffering and it's hard

544
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,640
to know what to do with that you see

545
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,640
that with

546
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,080
world war ii the stories of soldiers

547
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:43,200
that have suffered but

548
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:45,519
some of the closest bonds

549
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,519
of brotherhood of just pure love was

550
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:49,599
experienced by them

551
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,558
and it's it sucks that our brains are

552
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,319
like this

553
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,839
you know the love requires hardship i

554
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,720
don't know why that is

555
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,918
yeah that's like that's thing of course

556
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,038
in my journey i learned

557
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,320
how to survive right when to not trust

558
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:07,839
and when to run but i think

559
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:09,839
most of i was keep learning what it

560
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:11,678
means to be a human being

561
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,279
i think that was like ultimate thing i

562
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,519
was keep learning and

563
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:17,038
i still don't know fully what it means

564
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,240
but i do think it seems

565
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:23,599
like suffering is necessary for

566
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,200
people to be grateful and even be joyful

567
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,319
to sometimes

568
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:31,200
yeah so i talk about love quite a bit

569
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:33,119
and you mentioned that romantic love uh

570
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,558
i'm fascinated about

571
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:38,000
love in many aspects but

572
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,440
you mentioned romantic love was

573
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,240
forbidden in north korea yeah

574
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,798
what do you think about love now that

575
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,359
you've

576
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,558
kind of discovered it what's the role of

577
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,678
love in life

578
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,079
why was it so why do you think it was

579
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,320
forbidden in north korea

580
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,079
so the tragic thing about north korea is

581
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,839
not only just banning shakespeare

582
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,158
like we don't even know what romeo and

583
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,839
juliet is right our movies is never

584
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,240
about love stories

585
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:07,599
but then also they ban the love between

586
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,880
mother and daughter

587
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:13,519
wife and husband and you know

588
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,720
and you between your friends they deny

589
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:17,519
you being a human

590
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,919
so only love that i knew was when i

591
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:21,839
described my feeling towards the leader

592
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,919
and in the written form that was the

593
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:25,199
only love that people know in north

594
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,679
korea

595
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,720
and now i'm like there are many loves

596
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,400
you can experience

597
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,240
i mean i think you definitely love

598
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,159
science right

599
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,519
but imagine that if you're being denied

600
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,760
that yeah

601
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,119
so there are so many loves in life but

602
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:41,759
in north korea

603
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:42,158
all of those things are denied and i

604
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,599
think

605
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,000
for me is love what makes you tick

606
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:48,959
like you know love for your child love

607
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,079
for your parents

608
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:56,159
love your friends love for even yourself

609
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:58,399
that is denied so i mean many people say

610
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,120
like love is an option but like then why

611
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,600
do you live

612
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,279
i think we live to love and it doesn't

613
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:04,158
have to be romantic love it can be

614
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,440
anything

615
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,360
but finding love any in any person or

616
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,279
you know any subject i think that's a

617
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:12,558
goal i think that's when people find the

618
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,079
meaning in something

619
00:22:12,558 --> 00:22:16,319
yeah i think a lot of romantic love is

620
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:19,119
just one sort of part of it

621
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:20,798
yeah one echo of the some core thing

622
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:22,798
yeah science i love science i love

623
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:27,119
robots all of those things and

624
00:22:22,798 --> 00:22:30,480
it sounds like deliberately or not

625
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:31,279
the north korean regime wants to channel

626
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,159
that very

627
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,359
deep aspect of the human spirit all

628
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,880
towards the leader

629
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,399
yeah that's it that's the only thing

630
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,200
they allow us to fear

631
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:45,440
and know about so i remember i mean you

632
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,679
read 1984 by georgia where

633
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,480
it talks about double think and double

634
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,880
speak

635
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,159
who controls the language who controls

636
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,080
thoughts

637
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,240
and why he does talk about as they go

638
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,558
they like eliminate a lot of words

639
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,720
right now like later one word can

640
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:03,200
represent 10 different things

641
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,919
and like what fascinates me is like how

642
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,279
many

643
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,799
vocabulary meaning people can have and

644
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,200
like when i literally came out i

645
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,240
remember i went even to san francisco

646
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,600
and someone came to me and hugged me and

647
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,919
then he was a guy who's like

648
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,678
oh baby don't worry i'm gay i was like

649
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,799
what the heck is gay i don't know

650
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,840
right and then they try to go to hotel

651
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,639
room and google the gay

652
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,079
and i think oh that's what you meant and

653
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,240
like that like

654
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,240
they deny what that is i'm sure there

655
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,960
are gays in north korea i'm sure there

656
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,000
is

657
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:38,400
but you don't know what it is and

658
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,640
like that they eliminate words so the

659
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,960
fact that you know the concept

660
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,240
that is a state is much better than and

661
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,319
that's the thing a lot of people like

662
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,359
when you're born you somehow know what

663
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:50,158
justice is

664
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,759
what liberty is and it's all somebody

665
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,440
taught you that

666
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,798
and like that's the thing why people is

667
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,360
like oh humans are

668
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:59,359
inherently know what is right what is

669
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:02,558
wrong what is oppression and like

670
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:05,439
no that's like bs you gotta learn that's

671
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:08,480
fascinating that words

672
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,880
give rise to ideas so like

673
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,558
as a child one of the ways to learn

674
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,720
about justice and freedom

675
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:16,240
is to first learn the word and then to

676
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,480
ask well what is it

677
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,919
yeah the concept yeah and if you don't

678
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,159
have the word for it

679
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,120
then you never have the kind of first

680
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,799
spark

681
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:25,918
that leads to you trying to be curious

682
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,599
about it that's interesting and

683
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,720
controlling the words

684
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:31,839
and then yeah i mean your thoughts you

685
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,839
control the thoughts

686
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:38,319
there's so many echoes i mean i have uh

687
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:40,079
it's it's a very different but perhaps a

688
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:41,278
very similar experience which is the

689
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,399
journey of my family

690
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,400
through the soviet union

691
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,919
because there is a love of country there

692
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,000
is a pride of the people

693
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,200
yeah like you are proud of your family

694
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,359
in general yeah

695
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,960
but um i wonder how much of that is

696
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:59,519
polluted

697
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:03,759
by the the propaganda i think a lot too

698
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:06,879
for sure yeah it is to this day i'm like

699
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:10,079
my father who died in china and

700
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,320
he was tortured and then he died

701
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,119
he wanted to go back before his bath

702
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:15,119
right

703
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,119
and then it's like that if you go about

704
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:19,519
you're gonna be executed

705
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:20,639
and like i wanna be executed he wanted

706
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,639
to go back to north korea

707
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,480
to be executed so he can be buried in

708
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,919
his own land

709
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,880
and then his last wish was if i die

710
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,080
criminate me and then bring my ashes

711
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,600
back to my country

712
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:37,119
when i'm dead i still want to be my

713
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:39,119
country

714
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:40,839
and this is nationalism this is a

715
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:43,759
propaganda right

716
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:44,158
and but now like it's the same thing

717
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:47,119
like

718
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:49,039
it's the same thing if i die i somehow

719
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,519
buried in my land

720
00:25:49,038 --> 00:25:53,278
and i still feel like i'm the outsider

721
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,319
i'm always longing for my home it's a

722
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,159
horrible home

723
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:57,678
yeah like let people say what's your

724
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,440
dream like do you want to be a president

725
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,320
do you need to run for office like

726
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,880
i just want to go home that's my dream

727
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,759
right

728
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,559
and people here don't get it ever yeah i

729
00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,000
um

730
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:12,798
i don't know what to do with that i love

731
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,119
my country and i think for me my country

732
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:15,759
is

733
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:17,038
um the united states and perhaps it will

734
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,879
be for you too one day

735
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:20,798
it is i think it's becoming new years

736
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,760
has been a very special place in my

737
00:26:20,798 --> 00:26:23,278
heart

738
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,079
i think this is the first place i felt

739
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:28,960
like i i feel like home

740
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:30,158
and i mean i was in south korea longer

741
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,400
and i didn't feel that way

742
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,400
so so i think there were very different

743
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,120
life stories but i think

744
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,159
it's almost two different people the for

745
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,079
me it's the person that was in the

746
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,960
soviet union and the person that's

747
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,720
here those are two different people for

748
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,360
that previous person's home

749
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,759
in the soviet union and he's part of me

750
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,599
yeah

751
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:54,319
and i suppose in that same way you're

752
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,199
you know your first maybe two decades of

753
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,599
life

754
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,480
are somehow longing for the home that is

755
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,759
north korea

756
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:04,720
yeah and your next two decades of life

757
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,679
might be finding a home in the united

758
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,880
states

759
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:09,759
yeah your your dad uh can you tell the

760
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,919
story

761
00:27:09,759 --> 00:27:17,679
of um of his struggle

762
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,759
um uh of his death

763
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,120
i mean first do you miss him do you

764
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,240
think about it

765
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:25,359
all the time like i had a son when i was

766
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:28,558
22.

767
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:30,719
and i had ivf three times and

768
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:33,038
i know as you see i'm like 80 pounds but

769
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,399
back now like 75 pounds

770
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:36,480
because of my master of your

771
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,959
malnutrition somehow my body is very

772
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,960
different

773
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:46,000
and so after three times of av

774
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:49,278
ivf after 23 i was still wanting family

775
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,038
and the reason i wanted him is

776
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,359
because i felt so guilty for my father

777
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:56,640
that he never seen this world

778
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,079
i somehow like when you're so desperate

779
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,120
you become illogical

780
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,038
like i want to believe in the recon like

781
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,398
buddhist idea right you come back to

782
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,519
life

783
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:09,599
and i prayed please come to me like as

784
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,038
my son so i will take care of you like

785
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,439
come back

786
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,240
and when i was pregnant with my son even

787
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,240
though i planted pregnant with a girl

788
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,399
doctor made a mistake he became a boy

789
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,079
so i made his middle name like my

790
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,798
father's name since i think he's the

791
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:26,779
only

792
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:29,119
american got north korean name

793
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:32,158
[Laughter]

794
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,038
it is so he's so part of your father

795
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,240
isn't your son

796
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,798
yeah that's how i that's

797
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,880
how i make the sense of it and that's

798
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:44,639
how i move forward

799
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,919
like if i like as a logical human being

800
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,919
you you know when you're dead you're

801
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,880
done maybe that's that's what i at least

802
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,679
used to think

803
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,440
but then life just become too unbearable

804
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,600
and somehow that's the thing like

805
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,519
we tell ourselves stories in order to

806
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:59,439
live and that's how i came within my

807
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:02,158
title of the book in order to live

808
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,840
i had to tell myself a lot of stories to

809
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,360
overcome a lot of things

810
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:10,000
i think i was part of it

811
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:12,158
can you tell the story of um you

812
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,359
escaping north korea

813
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,360
to china yeah i think

814
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:24,639
it's it's a thing it's amazing

815
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:27,359
even though i was like 13 my like

816
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,759
life outside north korea is almost like

817
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,759
it went by like one second

818
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,599
and my life till that point was like

819
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:36,558
eternity

820
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:38,158
i remember being in china i arrived

821
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,918
there at the end of march

822
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:43,440
at 13 and by october it was six months

823
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,840
passed

824
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,360
and i literally felt like i lived

825
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:50,398
eternity

826
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:53,519
and one day living in china

827
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:54,319
felt like living one year one day was a

828
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,599
war like

829
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:59,678
surviving through one day was so hard

830
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:02,558
every night i was like i cannot believe

831
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,480
i got done one day today

832
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,678
that was the thing i was grateful for

833
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,880
before i went to bed

834
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,679
okay i survived i didn't get captured

835
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,039
and i made you another day on earth so

836
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:16,480
the experience

837
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:20,240
of the minutes is is what fear

838
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,440
fear of being captured fear

839
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,839
loss everything so

840
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,120
because i mean i sold my own mom in

841
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,480
china

842
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:33,839
to survive too

843
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,360
so it was more than that and

844
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,759
it's not feeling i think that's the

845
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:40,798
thing in china

846
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:43,278
i learned not to fear and

847
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:45,119
after my escape was challenging i didn't

848
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:49,038
feel anything

849
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:50,558
and it was hard not feeling anything is

850
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:51,519
a torture it's a bigger torture you can

851
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,918
never feel like

852
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,839
even you fear sadness that's better than

853
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,120
not feeling anything

854
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:02,158
and i fear something when i had my son

855
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:02,959
that's when i started healing so he was

856
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,600
a miracle

857
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,000
to save me but yeah in china it wasn't

858
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:09,359
even

859
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,798
fear like it was numb you were numb yeah

860
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,240
it was like paralysis

861
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:16,319
yeah just overwhelming

862
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,159
on the uncertainty of your future did

863
00:31:16,319 --> 00:31:20,240
you have a sense what your future

864
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,159
held at the time like what do you even

865
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,558
even feature i don't even know that word

866
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,519
right

867
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,759
like a lot of times i was looking at

868
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,359
myself like i left my body and like just

869
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,440
looking at me

870
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:32,719
and just not feeling it it's not like

871
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,720
i'm scared for her

872
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,839
i'm like sad for her just looking at me

873
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,120
like

874
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:39,918
oh that's interesting wow not feeling

875
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,798
anything

876
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,880
and me like being raped going through

877
00:31:42,798 --> 00:31:46,079
every emotion of life to survive right

878
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,519
like

879
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:51,359
but like like somehow i don't know

880
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,798
you say so or something like looking at

881
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,439
it just like

882
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,679
you feel nothing you don't feel anything

883
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,798
for that person

884
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,679
so even with your mom like what was

885
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:03,679
was there some

886
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,640
i don't know some warmth that you were

887
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,798
able to extract

888
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,919
from the connection with your mom yeah

889
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,398
of course i think that

890
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,440
made me survive i had a very strong

891
00:32:14,398 --> 00:32:18,719
connection

892
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,080
with my family and i think that's what

893
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,038
kept me going

894
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:24,558
to do all of that i think as you said i

895
00:32:23,038 --> 00:32:27,599
escaped at 13.

896
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,158
my sister at the age of 16 escaped with

897
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,678
her friend

898
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,000
first and i was going to escape with her

899
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,519
but

900
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,000
one day i got like really bad

901
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:37,200
stomachache and my parents took me to

902
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,720
hospital

903
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,480
and north korean hospital they don't

904
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,240
have like x-ray machines like they don't

905
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,399
even have electricity

906
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,839
they like literally using one needle to

907
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:47,839
inject everybody

908
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,519
yeah and people don't die from cancer

909
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:50,879
and north korea you die from infection

910
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,038
and fever and

911
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,799
hunger right it's most likely you're

912
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:55,519
gonna die more by being treated by

913
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,319
doctors and

914
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,798
not being treated i think i was lucky

915
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:02,639
even though they thought i had appendix

916
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:03,839
they they operate on me without any

917
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,120
painkiller

918
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:09,439
and i didn't get infection i survived

919
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,038
so that's how i got delayed to escape to

920
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,919
my sister

921
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:16,079
and she left me a note in my bedside

922
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,559
saying like follow this lady

923
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,000
and this is like another trick about

924
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:24,079
human trafficking right

925
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,278
she sold me to china as a sexual slave

926
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:29,599
and she executed fully later and she had

927
00:33:27,278 --> 00:33:31,278
she was executed for that later she had

928
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:34,319
five daughters

929
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:36,319
and she sold all her children to china

930
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,398
and we can now sitting here judging on

931
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,879
like how heartless you are

932
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,639
selling your own children to china and

933
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,278
as a sexual slave they were like her

934
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,640
children were

935
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:48,558
7 10 years old but that was the only way

936
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,200
for her to save her children

937
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,000
and if she didn't start me that day i

938
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,080
would be dead right

939
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:58,558
now so i'm grateful that she sold me

940
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:59,918
and i think that's the thing is life is

941
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:03,678
so crazy

942
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:06,480
you cannot judge it's just so complex

943
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,519
and yeah that's how she changed my life

944
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,320
by selling me

945
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,800
she sold my mom and myself in 2007 to

946
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,760
china

947
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,200
so you're grateful for that you're

948
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,960
grateful for that suffering

949
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,719
of course i am grateful because the

950
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,119
alternative is worse

951
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:24,239
i would not be here with you you never

952
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,240
knew i existed

953
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,559
what do you make of the others suffering

954
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:31,759
in the world today

955
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:35,119
the people there in north korea

956
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,200
so that is part of the your

957
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,200
of your life's work is helping those

958
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,480
people mm-hmm

959
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,719
what do you think about them what should

960
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,199
people know about them

961
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:46,398
i think that's when i get angry whenever

962
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,439
i think about them

963
00:34:46,398 --> 00:34:51,598
like your anger directed at

964
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,599
at

965
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,279
the heartlessness of people the

966
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,119
ignorance of people

967
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,920
like so when i got on north korea

968
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,440
going through all of them and i went to

969
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,639
south korea one day

970
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,400
i was watching television and just like

971
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:15,440
famous korean k-pop stars and crying and

972
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:17,119
doing some fundraising concerts and i

973
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,039
literally thought i was like oh my god

974
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,000
something is a horrible going wrong in

975
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:24,159
this country why are these people crying

976
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,039
it was cheery like campaign and then

977
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:27,440
later was

978
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,559
showing that it was the animal rights

979
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:30,639
campaign

980
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:31,679
to helping out cats and puppies in the

981
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,199
shelters

982
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,078
yeah do you know anybody she has their

983
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,279
tears like that

984
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,680
to another human being right now like no

985
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,760
right people rather give a million

986
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,440
dollars to save some dolphins

987
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,839
than saving these children right now

988
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,599
being raped in china

989
00:35:47,838 --> 00:35:53,599
and i think i love elon musk i read this

990
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,960
right i love these people want to like

991
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,119
go the moon

992
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,119
mars and like people told them like yeah

993
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,358
you went we went to the moon like i did

994
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,519
not know in north korea

995
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,598
i think that's what upsets me okay why

996
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:07,358
there is not even one single human

997
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:09,039
with that kind of brilliance in their

998
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,440
brain

999
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,759
they they can't save so much suffering

1000
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,119
that nobody does anything

1001
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,560
i think that's when i i feel like hard

1002
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,000
to find help in humanity

1003
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:24,400
and that's when i get so upset because

1004
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,280
think about like even biden or trump or

1005
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,639
obama

1006
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,200
they know what's happening in north

1007
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,400
korea exactly right i mean if we see

1008
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,960
satellite photos

1009
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,480
there's public executions i mean the u.n

1010
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,079
says this is the holocaust happening

1011
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,838
again

1012
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,359
and is it happening if the holocaust

1013
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:41,838
happening again how

1014
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,960
why how are you okay doing nothing about

1015
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:45,039
it

1016
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,358
but somehow humans are able to okay not

1017
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,400
doing anything

1018
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,920
and this is like this is

1019
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,119
hard like when people say i'm gonna

1020
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,039
change the world i want to make a

1021
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,480
difference like

1022
00:36:55,039 --> 00:37:00,559
it's hard to believe it you know

1023
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,159
yeah that we can turn our back to human

1024
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:03,599
suffering at scale when it's right in

1025
00:37:02,159 --> 00:37:04,879
front of us i mean that makes you think

1026
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,320
about the holocaust

1027
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:09,039
this is just everybody was looking the

1028
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,200
other way

1029
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,480
yeah because it was almost too hard to

1030
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,319
look at it

1031
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,679
no it's not it's the easier thing like

1032
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,838
it does the thing

1033
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:19,358
i was like here to speak at the south by

1034
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:20,639
southwest few years ago

1035
00:37:19,358 --> 00:37:22,400
and like they're everywhere talking

1036
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,358
about like elon musk project going to

1037
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,079
the moon right

1038
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:27,519
we're gonna be multi spell like species

1039
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,440
i was like

1040
00:37:27,519 --> 00:37:30,800
back then i did not even know who he was

1041
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,960
so if you're guys

1042
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,359
trying to go after this earth you

1043
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,960
haven't even explored our earth yet

1044
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:38,799
you cannot go to north korea right now

1045
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,240
you haven't explored that part of our

1046
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,320
our like planet can we do that first and

1047
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:46,479
then move on

1048
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,000
explore the landscape of human suffering

1049
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,400
like alleviate suffering in the world

1050
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,800
there's

1051
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,519
um there's a lot of suffering happening

1052
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,880
in africa

1053
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:55,358
that has to do with disease and for some

1054
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,320
reason

1055
00:37:55,358 --> 00:38:00,000
it's even though we turn our back to

1056
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,960
that kind of suffering too

1057
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,599
we still can try to do something about

1058
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:06,960
it

1059
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:08,559
and there's still efforts uh in terms of

1060
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,720
uh health care in terms of medicine in

1061
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,400
terms of bioengineering in terms of like

1062
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:14,480
all these efforts to help people from

1063
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,079
disease but like

1064
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,760
that's almost like converting into an

1065
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:18,000
engineering problem and trying to solve

1066
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,240
it

1067
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,760
that somehow is easier for us humans but

1068
00:38:20,239 --> 00:38:23,759
when there's obvious sort of

1069
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:30,559
non-disease-related

1070
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:33,519
torture of humans we look the other way

1071
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:34,480
yeah whether it's china or it's north

1072
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,759
korea

1073
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,719
yeah i mean that has to be changed

1074
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,320
somehow

1075
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,838
we'll have to change that somehow this

1076
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:44,640
is the thing right now like

1077
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,559
the china like they bring the xinjiang

1078
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,039
vigors right dave

1079
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,400
they say oh this vitamin take it and

1080
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:52,719
then it kills their sperm

1081
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,039
and make them not reproduce their birth

1082
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:55,759
rate gone down something 47 to something

1083
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:58,159
50

1084
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,680
in the one year time it's a genocide in

1085
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:01,838
21st century

1086
00:38:59,679 --> 00:39:03,759
and they get those people and get their

1087
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:05,679
like organs out

1088
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,720
imagine if there's some people who do

1089
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:10,799
that with cutie puppies and cats

1090
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,519
there's gonna be insane amount of

1091
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,160
product they're gonna destroy everything

1092
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,599
and this is like a human nature that i

1093
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:20,239
don't get

1094
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,160
why there's so much anti-human sentiment

1095
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:23,199
in this modern world like we don't have

1096
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:25,440
to like

1097
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:27,279
the the fact that i was saying like the

1098
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,358
fact that you care about animals rights

1099
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,560
it's beautiful because you care about

1100
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:31,679
something who cannot speak for

1101
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:33,199
themselves

1102
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,039
the fact that we care about animals is

1103
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,199
because they cannot speak for themselves

1104
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,358
right they don't have that

1105
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,519
ability and there are many people who

1106
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,838
cannot speak for themselves right now

1107
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,559
and why do you refuse to be the voice

1108
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,279
for them

1109
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:49,920
because they're simply being a human and

1110
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,200
maybe it connects to us

1111
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,440
not being proud of who we are like maybe

1112
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,319
i don't know what it is why do they deny

1113
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,079
humans

1114
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,838
this way maybe they don't like

1115
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,039
themselves

1116
00:39:59,838 --> 00:40:04,400
yeah it's almost um we would have to

1117
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:08,079
acknowledge some dark things about

1118
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,079
ourselves in order to start helping

1119
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:14,318
what's the solution so you know i see

1120
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,519
two solutions

1121
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:20,559
one is in the military side

1122
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:24,000
yeah it's uh assassination

1123
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:28,480
or the full-on invasion

1124
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:33,519
and then on the activism side

1125
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:36,800
which is figuring out ways to um

1126
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:38,400
like like you said sort of let people in

1127
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,640
north korea

1128
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:42,960
understand their situation sort of from

1129
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,799
within try to reform

1130
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,400
or maybe there's others obviously there

1131
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,119
could be activism

1132
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,960
from the outside to build up momentum

1133
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:53,838
for the entirety of the world

1134
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,760
especially the world that it's not just

1135
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:57,679
the united states or europe but also as

1136
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,040
russia and china and so on

1137
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:04,239
what what are your ideas here how we can

1138
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:05,440
what we can do as individuals and as

1139
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,358
countries

1140
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,480
i think the first thing that we can do

1141
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:10,480
is speak about

1142
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:12,400
chinese role in this sponsoring

1143
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:15,440
dictatorship in north korea

1144
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,519
like i haven't had so much struggle

1145
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,599
talking about north korea right they say

1146
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,318
how north korea is possible why is it

1147
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,359
like the way like this is

1148
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:28,559
99 accountability going to

1149
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:31,440
ccp kim jong-un cannot last

1150
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:31,679
without chinese have even one week this

1151
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,838
is

1152
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,519
completely funded this holocaust is

1153
00:41:33,838 --> 00:41:37,440
funded by ccp

1154
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:39,519
but if you talk about in the mainstream

1155
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,400
of course they don't buy it

1156
00:41:39,519 --> 00:41:43,440
and i think it's in a way north korea is

1157
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,680
a lot easier to

1158
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,440
serve than even in the middle east

1159
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:49,919
there's nothing conflict like

1160
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,200
between people there's no ideology no

1161
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:53,039
religion nothing

1162
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,799
people are peaceful right there's not

1163
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:57,759
even one civil

1164
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,000
any discontent among the people or

1165
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,880
problem is there's a dictator funded by

1166
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,358
the second economic power in the world

1167
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,599
and

1168
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:07,119
even any military they know if they kill

1169
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:08,160
kim jong-un they're gonna get killed by

1170
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,160
chinese

1171
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,879
nobody can dare to stand up against kim

1172
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:15,039
jong because of china is backing it

1173
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,318
so somehow here in the west we

1174
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:18,239
collectively

1175
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:19,519
acknowledging that china is the

1176
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:21,039
responsible person

1177
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:25,039
for these crimes against humanity in

1178
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:28,318
north korea then we can somehow

1179
00:42:25,039 --> 00:42:32,480
i don't know china exactly we're

1180
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:34,318
we're failing to do that in a way

1181
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,679
in all kinds of avenues of life of

1182
00:42:34,318 --> 00:42:38,079
public life

1183
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:41,679
because uh for many reasons they're

1184
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:46,400
probably primarily financial

1185
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:48,159
but it also i'm against

1186
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,400
i don't know maybe you can correct me

1187
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:54,799
i'm against sort of

1188
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:58,000
making china this evil enemy

1189
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,720
because i've seen this with russia as

1190
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,400
well and i don't think that leads to

1191
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,959
progress

1192
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,160
i think you want to highlight like you

1193
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:10,400
basically want to

1194
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:12,078
help china the chinese people

1195
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,920
become the best versions of themselves

1196
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,440
so speak to the chinese people

1197
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,159
and not fear not uh making the leaders

1198
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,720
of china

1199
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:21,759
the like into these caricatures of

1200
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:23,679
devils

1201
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,240
i i feel like the cold war the way it

1202
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:28,318
was done in russia i just for

1203
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,239
both sides they were caricaturing each

1204
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:31,838
other through propaganda and the result

1205
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:33,519
was not productive at all

1206
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,279
it did not help russia become the best

1207
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:37,199
country it could be did not help america

1208
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:39,359
become the best country it could be

1209
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:41,598
and the same thing with china i feel

1210
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:44,880
like making them into this enemy

1211
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,480
like being afraid of china being

1212
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,318
making them into the thing that's going

1213
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,199
to spy on us that's going to destroy the

1214
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:52,159
rest of the world

1215
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:53,919
that's not going to help china like

1216
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:54,960
reform themselves they're going to plant

1217
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,200
their feet

1218
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,240
the dictators the evil people will

1219
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:01,039
become more evil

1220
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:02,719
the power hungry will become more like

1221
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,480
they will centralize the power more it

1222
00:44:02,719 --> 00:44:07,759
feels like

1223
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:11,039
um maybe naive but it feels like

1224
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,680
it should be like again

1225
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:16,960
love not violence that solves this thing

1226
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:20,159
now of course in north korea it's like

1227
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,400
long gone 80 years

1228
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,000
almost 80 years old you can't love is

1229
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,400
not going to solve that problem or

1230
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,318
i mean i don't it's very difficult they

1231
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:31,599
have tried that

1232
00:44:28,318 --> 00:44:33,119
because of the sunshine policy which is

1233
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,960
there's a two people walking down the

1234
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,519
street and the sun and the wind made a

1235
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,519
battle

1236
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,199
so who can take off that man take off

1237
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:42,239
jacket so wind

1238
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,199
tried to blow as much air he could and

1239
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:44,799
then that man was

1240
00:44:43,199 --> 00:44:46,719
like putting more like his jacket on

1241
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,160
right not taking off but sunshine came

1242
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:48,959
like okay i'm gonna give him a lot of

1243
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:50,639
worms

1244
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,800
and then he took his jacket out and came

1245
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:55,118
out so that was the theory let's give

1246
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,119
north korea as much love they want

1247
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:58,480
let's give them a lot of money whatever

1248
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,079
they want let's give to them

1249
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,159
do they know that we are not here to

1250
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:03,920
attack them yeah and north korea what

1251
00:45:02,159 --> 00:45:06,078
they did with the guy who did the

1252
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:06,800
sunshine policy in south korea named kim

1253
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,440
daesung

1254
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,000
won the nobel peace prize for that and

1255
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,920
kim

1256
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,358
kim jong-il used the money to build

1257
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:15,920
nuclear weapons

1258
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:17,838
so that's how they came with the nukes

1259
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,159
so i think

1260
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:21,199
that's the thing i hope your love serves

1261
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:22,559
problems

1262
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:25,118
but there's got to be a way and that's

1263
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,639
the the hope is with the 21st century

1264
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,160
you can directly speak to the people

1265
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:28,559
somehow when there's no internet when

1266
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,239
there's

1267
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,679
nothing like that it's hopeless i think

1268
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,439
china there's a hope

1269
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,960
that yeah the china is still connected

1270
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,599
to the internet i love your optimism

1271
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,240
i have seen the actual dark side of

1272
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:44,000
china

1273
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:45,519
on the underground i hope

1274
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,599
i think that's the thing people here in

1275
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:48,400
the west right they say oh how can it be

1276
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:52,318
that bad

1277
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,800
they ask me like i walking passing this

1278
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:56,719
young teenager man in near the world

1279
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,519
with my sister

1280
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,799
he's like intestine coming out through

1281
00:45:59,519 --> 00:46:03,920
his bad way

1282
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,400
and even in that moment what he wanted

1283
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,200
was

1284
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,960
please give me food he was hungry his

1285
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:10,078
intestine is hanging out of his body

1286
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,199
yeah and he's

1287
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:15,839
asking for food do you know what humans

1288
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,358
demand when they die in north korea all

1289
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:20,639
they want is eating

1290
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,519
right yeah and people say oh nothing can

1291
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:24,639
be that bad

1292
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:28,079
but people just here haven't seen an

1293
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:30,000
actual true evil would you say that the

1294
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,800
evil comes from a tiny minority of

1295
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,960
people

1296
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,920
or does it permeate much larger parts of

1297
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,358
the population

1298
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:40,559
like if we look at sex trafficking

1299
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:44,159
how many people

1300
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:46,799
like is it 99.9 of the people are s

1301
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:46,799
are um

1302
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:54,318
longing to do good in the world

1303
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:56,400
or is there is it uh

1304
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,159
or do we all have the capacity for evil

1305
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,800
in certain kind of environment certain

1306
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:01,279
kind of

1307
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,079
uh governmental structures inspire a

1308
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:04,240
large

1309
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,359
percent of the population to do bad

1310
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:08,159
things

1311
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,440
i think humans are capable of anything

1312
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,679
there is no exception

1313
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,358
i don't think there's any saying to born

1314
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:16,318
with a morality

1315
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:18,318
i think in north korea you can say

1316
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:19,039
initially that there's few guys in the

1317
00:47:18,318 --> 00:47:21,759
top

1318
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:23,358
wanting the power and then doing this

1319
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,359
but

1320
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:26,480
eventually made a society where people

1321
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:28,880
don't even know what

1322
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,639
compassion is we don't know the concept

1323
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,240
of we don't know that you need to feel

1324
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,199
bad for another human being when they're

1325
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:35,519
suffering

1326
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:37,598
the fact that you know compassion is in

1327
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:40,719
your knowledge that's why you do that

1328
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:43,119
humans need to learn it's not anything

1329
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:45,358
bad about human nature it's just saying

1330
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,519
humans are capable of everything we are

1331
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:48,719
the most adaptable species on the planet

1332
00:47:47,519 --> 00:47:51,358
that's why we

1333
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,078
created the internet like talking this

1334
00:47:51,358 --> 00:47:53,598
way right

1335
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,440
now other animals have done it because

1336
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:57,200
we are so adaptable

1337
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,720
that is a good thing and that's a bad

1338
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:02,318
thing so in the adaptive situation

1339
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:04,239
they all can be i mean during the

1340
00:48:02,318 --> 00:48:06,400
holocaust right those people

1341
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,479
they could have been capable of good too

1342
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,039
if they were exposed to different system

1343
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,400
yeah and that's why when people

1344
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:15,920
underestimate evil

1345
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:18,318
that's what scares me evil is evil

1346
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,519
it's a different thing it's a completely

1347
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:21,838
different thing

1348
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:24,159
and of course i could really get your

1349
00:48:21,838 --> 00:48:27,199
idea we don't want to isolate 1.3

1350
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:29,598
billion human beings in on earth by

1351
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,558
chinese but the thing is we are talking

1352
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:32,960
about this

1353
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,079
regime not the people i love chinese

1354
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:36,880
people i speak chinese

1355
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:37,839
i love like all about the country but

1356
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:40,318
this system

1357
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:42,239
does promote evil well that's an

1358
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:45,599
optimistic view actually because

1359
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,399
we can fix systems yeah it's harder to

1360
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,240
fix people

1361
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,079
so if we fix systems then the people are

1362
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,399
adaptable absolutely as you said

1363
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:53,839
i mean that and then the question is uh

1364
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:55,838
first of all you have to

1365
00:48:53,838 --> 00:48:57,759
talk about it just as you're doing

1366
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:59,519
you're right now like this little flame

1367
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:02,640
that burns bright and it's really

1368
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:04,800
important for north korea but just keep

1369
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:08,318
talking about it

1370
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,920
until there's until hopefully

1371
00:49:08,318 --> 00:49:14,079
leads to at the highest levels of power

1372
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,119
revolutionizing the systems in the world

1373
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:18,240
and then

1374
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,960
uh in china and in north korea do you

1375
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:21,199
see

1376
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:23,358
north korea being a potential instigator

1377
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:26,399
of a nuclear war

1378
00:49:23,358 --> 00:49:28,318
they will not start any korean war as

1379
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,280
long as they can do whatever they want

1380
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:33,119
right now

1381
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:34,640
right north korea's army not designed to

1382
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,640
fight the enemy

1383
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,639
they designed to prevent their own

1384
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,400
people the quteta and the revolution

1385
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:43,519
with their own citizens

1386
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,240
that is 1.6 million north korea

1387
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:49,119
with a tiny country the fourth largest

1388
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,598
armies in the world

1389
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,800
so this this country designed to fight

1390
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,359
with their own citizens

1391
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:56,400
and the army the fourth largest in the

1392
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,519
world

1393
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:01,440
is designed to basically fight its own

1394
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:05,280
people oppress their own people that's

1395
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,280
what north korean military is about

1396
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:12,880
okay let me uh ask you some

1397
00:50:10,719 --> 00:50:14,239
aspects about north korean life can you

1398
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,880
describe the seongbon

1399
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:17,759
system of uh ascribed status used in

1400
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,920
north korea

1401
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:21,440
yeah so that's a very interesting thing

1402
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,358
right right now there are a lot of

1403
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,318
people playing with this ideology of

1404
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:26,880
like

1405
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:29,279
democratic socialism socialism communism

1406
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,880
whatever you call marxism leninism right

1407
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,400
they have all like these similar

1408
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,039
features where

1409
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,240
we give collective power to a certain

1410
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:38,558
entity

1411
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:39,519
and they will make the decision for the

1412
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,640
bigger good

1413
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:43,199
right and north korea came up with the

1414
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:45,519
idea

1415
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,799
the kimir song he was the leninist he

1416
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:48,880
was marxist

1417
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,119
saying i'm gonna create the most equal

1418
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,599
society on human face

1419
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,480
so it was a communist north korea and

1420
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,400
then

1421
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,358
they came up with this tumbling system

1422
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:02,480
it's a family caste system

1423
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:04,078
three b categories warrior wavering and

1424
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,480
hostile

1425
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:08,000
and then in between three classes they

1426
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,400
divide into 50 different

1427
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,480
classes so a lot of people don't even

1428
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,639
know which exact class you belong to

1429
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:16,559
that's a sacred golem document and

1430
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,239
that's how they decide your future so in

1431
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:20,559
no way north korea

1432
00:51:18,239 --> 00:51:22,239
before you're born your life is

1433
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,839
determined for you

1434
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,439
and this is normal joke right they

1435
00:51:23,838 --> 00:51:26,480
dreamed of creating the most equal

1436
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:28,800
society

1437
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,838
they ended up with became most inequal

1438
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,640
society in the

1439
00:51:29,838 --> 00:51:33,920
face of humanity so there are 50

1440
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:35,759
different classes

1441
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,280
and where the one guy on the top became

1442
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,359
a god

1443
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,559
so when this animal farm as we keep

1444
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:42,480
saying like there's so many

1445
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,839
all the animals are equal and someone

1446
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:46,480
and more equal than others

1447
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:47,279
exactly but but it's not only it's just

1448
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,440
more equal

1449
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,319
one guy in our school became a god

1450
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:55,838
because north korea was born

1451
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:59,039
out of uh marxist ideals yeah

1452
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:03,199
from stalin can you comment on

1453
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:07,599
uh juche ideology which seems to

1454
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:11,439
be its own kind of socialism

1455
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:14,800
but uh with unique aspects here

1456
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:16,720
it really does ideologically says the

1457
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,800
importance of having a great leader

1458
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:20,879
yeah is there some interesting

1459
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,920
similarities or differences that you can

1460
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,680
comment on

1461
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:25,599
between other implementations of

1462
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:29,039
communism throughout history

1463
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,599
the soviet union china elsewhere

1464
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:34,079
so tutor is very unique it came around

1465
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:36,559
the 90s after soviet union collapsed

1466
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,000
so before that north korea was very

1467
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:39,119
still loyal to the marxist and

1468
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,838
melanianism

1469
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,680
which is state takes care of you we are

1470
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:46,400
going to give you the right education

1471
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:47,919
health care your livelihood you

1472
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,039
everybody's going to be equal

1473
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:51,519
you're going to have in the working

1474
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,599
collective form collective workplace

1475
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:56,559
everybody collectively do things

1476
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:59,599
together and let's work for the paradise

1477
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,680
but 1991 the soviet union collapsed

1478
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,240
and until then north korea was heavily

1479
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:05,519
subsidized by soviet union's aid

1480
00:53:04,239 --> 00:53:08,318
and then soviet didn't give them

1481
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,519
anything so now three million people die

1482
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:11,279
on the streets

1483
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,639
the regime then came up with the idea

1484
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:15,519
okay our goal

1485
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:17,358
is what is successful ruling for us is

1486
00:53:15,519 --> 00:53:19,599
keeping the 10 percent

1487
00:53:17,358 --> 00:53:20,880
of population alive which is in the

1488
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:23,519
capital pyongyang

1489
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,480
so they design the hunger games there is

1490
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:26,880
a capital

1491
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,838
13 other districts everybody on the

1492
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,079
countryside on purpose being starved

1493
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:33,199
so those people who are starving cannot

1494
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:35,039
thinking about meaning of

1495
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:36,558
life cannot thinking about shooting to

1496
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:37,759
the moon right they're not gonna think

1497
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:40,160
about anything or they're gonna think

1498
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,440
it's like finding next meal

1499
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:45,440
all on purpose is man-made famine

1500
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,880
international community was begging to

1501
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,000
give north korea food

1502
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:51,920
why not stood at the u.n they begged to

1503
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,400
give north korea formula

1504
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,000
medicine and food they are begging can

1505
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,599
you please feed your people and kimchon

1506
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,159
said no thank you

1507
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:02,000
last year like we knows had a horrible

1508
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:02,719
horror flooding south korean prisons are

1509
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:04,480
begging

1510
00:54:02,719 --> 00:54:06,000
can you get can i give you please some

1511
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,318
medicines like no

1512
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,760
because he wants to be the one provider

1513
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:11,279
he doesn't want people to think other

1514
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,440
people giving him the thing

1515
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:14,559
so on purpose other people are starving

1516
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,318
and the truth

1517
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,240
idea is that's when you're coming from

1518
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:19,838
so until that communism was about like

1519
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,239
steady speaking being a

1520
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:24,000
father figure takes care of all your

1521
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:26,078
needs right give the power to us

1522
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,199
and you are all good but north korea

1523
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,039
regime says okay

1524
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:30,558
now we cannot give people's rations so

1525
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:33,679
which means

1526
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,800
means self-reliance you need to take

1527
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:37,358
care of yourself

1528
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,000
while you're giving every right to us so

1529
00:54:37,358 --> 00:54:41,119
now

1530
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,440
in 1990s the regime told us okay

1531
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,318
we are not going to give you russian you

1532
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,559
cannot trade

1533
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:47,759
that's illegal but you find your own way

1534
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:51,359
to survive

1535
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:53,119
so be self-reliant that's what to say

1536
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,798
and you know but when you're a god you

1537
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,760
can do whatever you want you don't need

1538
00:54:54,798 --> 00:54:57,759
to make a sense

1539
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,119
that's the difference being a god and

1540
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,319
being a leader

1541
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:03,519
even it is religion it's not falsifiable

1542
00:55:02,318 --> 00:55:07,119
you cannot challenge it

1543
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:08,400
god's way is suspicious god works in the

1544
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,720
mysterious way

1545
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,639
so when you're god people are not gonna

1546
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:14,798
say oh this doesn't make sense right

1547
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:17,118
you're gonna okay whatever god says

1548
00:55:14,798 --> 00:55:18,239
we as a human being we can never change

1549
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,720
these thoughts

1550
00:55:18,239 --> 00:55:23,039
it is unbelievable what regimes can do

1551
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:27,838
the there's something about

1552
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,838
famine you know

1553
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:36,798
that um is another

1554
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:39,920
is another level of evil to me

1555
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:40,719
you know what stalin did in ukraine in

1556
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:44,159
the 30s

1557
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:48,558
yeah him

1558
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:51,920
yeah this is what torture is

1559
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:55,280
cannibalism yeah and um

1560
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:58,240
north korea too they humans right now

1561
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,519
in 21st century seven billion people on

1562
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,919
this earth right now

1563
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:03,039
you make the enough food for 10 billion

1564
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,240
people

1565
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:08,639
nobody should be starving right now it's

1566
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,639
worrisome to me the humanity is moving

1567
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:12,000
forward with the technological advances

1568
00:56:10,639 --> 00:56:15,039
blah blah we are going so

1569
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,159
fast in in advancement and we are living

1570
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,159
this like 25

1571
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:20,159
million human beings in the cage

1572
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,000
completely leaving them behind

1573
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:23,598
and north korea is living like 16

1574
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:25,599
centuries i never

1575
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,960
like this morning i was taking a shower

1576
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,000
beautiful shower

1577
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:32,798
like one never knew what shower was i

1578
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,519
was bathing few few times a year going

1579
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:36,480
to the like

1580
00:56:33,519 --> 00:56:37,199
river how do i even know what shampoo is

1581
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,838
and this is

1582
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,838
how human beings in 20 persons living

1583
00:56:39,838 --> 00:56:44,798
and it doesn't bother us and rather

1584
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:45,199
most people obsess being a vegan and

1585
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:48,798
like

1586
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:50,639
how how do you reconcile this

1587
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:52,480
i think we get used to stuff very

1588
00:56:50,639 --> 00:56:54,239
quickly we get used to comforts that's

1589
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,760
just the way of human life you

1590
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:57,279
you take the beautiful things for

1591
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,119
granted

1592
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,480
so i try to appreciate everything i have

1593
00:56:59,119 --> 00:57:03,599
so whether it's

1594
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,199
uh like the food i have now or like the

1595
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,119
luxury to have a diet and

1596
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:09,598
to be struggling with that yeah or just

1597
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,640
the basic simple moments of being alive

1598
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,720
with the people i love

1599
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:14,159
or actually i get like i think i'm on

1600
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:17,039
drugs all the time because

1601
00:57:14,159 --> 00:57:18,239
i feel like just even like uh this mug

1602
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,519
everything on this table

1603
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:24,318
just brings me joy but it's

1604
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:24,639
like filling your life with joy in the

1605
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:27,279
full

1606
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:29,118
capitalistic american way you can still

1607
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,000
at the same time

1608
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,559
uh not feel too bad about yourself no

1609
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,358
and still

1610
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:37,119
focus on the the suffering in the world

1611
00:57:35,358 --> 00:57:40,400
and i think

1612
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:43,838
there's some way

1613
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:47,358
that in trying to build a better world

1614
00:57:43,838 --> 00:57:52,000
in america it has ripple effects

1615
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:55,199
elsewhere sort of like so i'm a fan of

1616
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:57,039
rockets in space it sounds perhaps

1617
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,239
counter-intuitive but sending raucous to

1618
00:57:57,039 --> 00:58:01,920
space

1619
00:57:58,239 --> 00:58:05,118
will help solve the north korea

1620
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:08,318
a problem because it lets

1621
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:10,400
people dream yeah and build

1622
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,599
cool stuff so it's not the rocket it's

1623
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:13,920
the other people

1624
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:15,200
that like are inspired by the rocket and

1625
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,039
then look to

1626
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,798
other problems in the world i mean

1627
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:20,960
that's what elon did is like he saw

1628
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:22,639
problems in the world and saw like what

1629
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,280
can i do to help it

1630
00:58:22,639 --> 00:58:26,318
and i think the north korea one is a

1631
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:29,359
tough one though

1632
00:58:26,318 --> 00:58:33,920
because that's ultimately has to do

1633
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:36,798
with revolutionizing government

1634
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,318
china china that's what it takes

1635
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:39,358
changing chinese communist party is

1636
00:58:38,318 --> 00:58:41,039
impossible

1637
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:42,639
that's why we couldn't solve north korea

1638
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:44,639
for that many decades but

1639
00:58:42,639 --> 00:58:45,838
it's china well for now it's china but

1640
00:58:44,639 --> 00:58:48,879
it's china

1641
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:51,759
it's um so it's uh

1642
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,160
russia it's certain aspects of the

1643
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,319
united states and struggling with that

1644
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:58,318
uh one of the you know there's a bunch

1645
00:58:56,318 --> 00:58:58,719
of technologies that are striving at

1646
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:01,838
this

1647
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:03,358
um for example uh i don't know what your

1648
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:06,880
thoughts about cryptocurrencies

1649
00:59:03,358 --> 00:59:10,159
i love it so like there's a idea that

1650
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,960
money could be a way to destroy or to

1651
00:59:10,159 --> 00:59:13,358
challenge the power centers of the world

1652
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,199
yeah

1653
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:18,318
so if you give if you take away the

1654
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:19,759
power from fiat currency and give it to

1655
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:21,279
this thing that can't be controlled by

1656
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,880
government that's cryptocurrency whether

1657
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,440
it's bitcoin ethereum all those kinds of

1658
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,318
things

1659
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,039
that's a way to get money into the hands

1660
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:28,880
of people

1661
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:30,079
to where the government can't take that

1662
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,559
money away

1663
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,760
but north koreans don't have electricity

1664
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,559
no internet

1665
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:38,319
so yeah we can do that with china we can

1666
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:38,960
do it a lot of african dictatorship

1667
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,838
countries

1668
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,760
right i do think big cryptocurrency is

1669
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:45,759
such a fascinating technology

1670
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,440
right i think this is an amazing

1671
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,319
experiment i mean

1672
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,000
that power is in our hands i'm the huge

1673
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:55,358
advocate believer

1674
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:57,119
but i think nurses too behind yeah you

1675
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:58,400
know i think that's what is unique about

1676
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,880
north korea is that

1677
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,960
most of things that we talk about is now

1678
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,640
it's different planet literally

1679
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:07,280
the common law that we have is now

1680
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:07,279
applicable

1681
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:15,760
what about kim jong-un kim jong-un yeah

1682
01:00:12,318 --> 01:00:18,239
is he intentionally evil or is he

1683
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,839
mindless mindlessly propagating an evil

1684
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:22,959
system created by his

1685
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:25,119
ancestors what's your sense of the man

1686
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,960
so with the keemer's song i can give him

1687
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:29,680
more than i feel that

1688
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,039
he was a initial true believer of

1689
01:00:29,679 --> 01:00:33,279
communism

1690
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:35,039
but then as later he gained the power he

1691
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,720
realizing

1692
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:38,960
i think i guess back then he thought

1693
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:39,838
most of people are dumb my individuals

1694
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:41,838
don't

1695
01:00:39,838 --> 01:00:42,960
so therefore i need to make a decision

1696
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:45,519
for all of you

1697
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:47,599
that pure arrogance came from out of him

1698
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:50,880
even that i can tolerate okay

1699
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:53,359
fine and kim jong-il who never like yeah

1700
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:55,519
fine he grew up in that system too but

1701
01:00:53,358 --> 01:01:00,400
kim jong-un is very unique

1702
01:00:55,519 --> 01:01:03,519
this guy was educated in switzerland

1703
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,240
in the heart of democracy he knew how

1704
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:07,920
human beings

1705
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:10,078
should be treated as a child event

1706
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,599
when you're a child your brain is very

1707
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,760
susceptible

1708
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,039
right you change anybody like why the

1709
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,359
mall was so pleasant

1710
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:19,358
changing young people's minds like

1711
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:19,838
that's every revolutionary they do right

1712
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:22,400
they go

1713
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:24,798
change young people's minds first this

1714
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,039
guy was so obsessed with the power

1715
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:28,000
him being a god even starting in

1716
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:30,960
switzerland

1717
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,199
didn't change him and that's why i think

1718
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,639
that's a pure evil

1719
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:37,358
you know i can't give him more benefit

1720
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:39,440
or thought to his grandfather and father

1721
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:41,519
but when it comes to kim jong-un this is

1722
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:44,400
like what pure evil looks like

1723
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:46,719
pure selfish being yeah that's what it

1724
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:48,798
looks like

1725
01:01:46,719 --> 01:01:49,759
is there is there some sense where he's

1726
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:51,920
justifying

1727
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,680
everything he's doing to himself or do

1728
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:57,039
you think there's a psychopathic

1729
01:01:53,679 --> 01:02:00,239
aspect to where he enjoys the suffering

1730
01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:02,640
i think in his life right i read a lot

1731
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,639
about like north korea a lot of cia

1732
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:05,598
documents a lot of intelligence people

1733
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:07,358
work there

1734
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,880
and even like worked in north korean

1735
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:11,920
type elites and escaped i

1736
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:15,519
could hear about them so kim jong-un

1737
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:18,559
when they're born they treat like gods

1738
01:02:15,519 --> 01:02:19,920
so they never have a sense of them being

1739
01:02:18,559 --> 01:02:22,559
a human

1740
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,400
they're like equal with others for them

1741
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,880
like if you're just any kind of

1742
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,079
tool like that what napoleon like thing

1743
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,480
does right

1744
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,960
anybody's a tool like once boxer dies

1745
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:34,798
you get him slaughtered for my cause

1746
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:36,400
and they do not even feel guilty about

1747
01:02:34,798 --> 01:02:38,400
it because they don't view us that you

1748
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,920
deserve you are worthy of it

1749
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:42,639
yeah that's right so it's not like he

1750
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:43,519
even fears he doesn't even recognize the

1751
01:02:42,639 --> 01:02:46,318
suffering

1752
01:02:43,519 --> 01:02:48,079
like of course you you this this is what

1753
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:51,519
you do serving me

1754
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:51,839
because i am i am this so i think that's

1755
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:54,159
like

1756
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:55,679
beyond that like he's not like suffering

1757
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:57,759
his enters his minds

1758
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:59,279
he doesn't even think what we go through

1759
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,440
you see he thinks is himself

1760
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,480
as a as a god yeah and then everybody

1761
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:05,358
else is just uh

1762
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,639
tools that are disposable right there

1763
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:09,598
was rumors

1764
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:10,480
several times of him dying yeah do you

1765
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:13,519
think he is

1766
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:15,599
um obviously his health

1767
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:17,440
is not good do you think he will die

1768
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:20,798
soon what happens if

1769
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,798
kim jong-un dies

1770
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:23,920
well when it comes to north korea

1771
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,838
anybody knows what they're going

1772
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:28,159
what kim jong-un does it's lie right

1773
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:30,000
nobody knows i'm sure cia knows but they

1774
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:33,038
may never reveal that

1775
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:35,199
cia has enough intelligence to can tell

1776
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:36,880
where kim jong-un is what he's doing

1777
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:39,038
they just don't assassinate him because

1778
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:40,559
they don't see the

1779
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:42,000
needs of it right now because do you

1780
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,680
think they can assassinate him they

1781
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:45,519
can't they do have ability abilities

1782
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:47,038
why the hell do they not assassinate

1783
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:48,960
them because they don't care they don't

1784
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,760
care about the suffering of 25 million

1785
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:51,599
people

1786
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,960
they gotta pay the price if they sell

1787
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:54,640
assassin kim jong-un

1788
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,480
they gotta pay the price there will be

1789
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:57,118
financial there'll be political price to

1790
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:00,719
pay

1791
01:03:57,119 --> 01:04:02,160
it will anger china absolutely that is a

1792
01:04:00,719 --> 01:04:03,199
huge piece for them and then they'll

1793
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:04,960
have to deal

1794
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,118
obviously there'll be financial military

1795
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:10,079
consequences of having to deal with

1796
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:11,599
the turmoil the uncertainty yeah the

1797
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:14,000
revolutions that will spring up

1798
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:15,359
yeah that's the thing like that's why

1799
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:16,798
they don't want to take that risk they

1800
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,838
don't want to do anything

1801
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:21,759
the u.s now became very passive when

1802
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:22,558
they pursue these mortal values to the

1803
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,680
rest of the world

1804
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,359
they did the same thing with the

1805
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:26,960
holocaust in the early days actually

1806
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:27,440
yeah they were like just they didn't

1807
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:29,920
care

1808
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:31,920
and that's what they're always policy

1809
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:35,440
has been they don't care i mean

1810
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:37,358
so if kim jong-un dies it's gonna be

1811
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:39,599
very hard for north korea to replace

1812
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:41,119
anybody in his position because kim's is

1813
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:43,519
a brand

1814
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:45,039
it's not just like a leader for us right

1815
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:47,440
whenever we think of kim

1816
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,960
who came with my mind like who's like

1817
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,440
almost god figure

1818
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,798
like north korea is the number 10

1819
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:55,760
religions in the world

1820
01:04:52,798 --> 01:04:56,559
they copy the bible so if you believe

1821
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:58,480
that

1822
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:00,160
if there are people believing that god

1823
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,679
and jesus christ

1824
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,759
how do you not believe that north korea

1825
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:06,399
believes in the same thing so kim

1826
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:07,599
il-sung's grandfather and his parents

1827
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,960
were

1828
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:13,200
devout christians so kim your son was

1829
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,318
grew up just like christian like word

1830
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:17,358
verses

1831
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:19,679
so when he finding his country he said

1832
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:21,358
i love my people so much that i'm giving

1833
01:05:19,679 --> 01:05:23,519
you my son kim jong-il

1834
01:05:21,358 --> 01:05:24,480
his body dies but he spirits with us

1835
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,880
forever

1836
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,639
who can know how many hair i have what i

1837
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,440
think and when we suffer

1838
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:33,038
we go to paradise with him and when you

1839
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:34,480
block every single information going

1840
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:36,079
into country of course people are gonna

1841
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:38,719
believe it

1842
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:40,318
so who would be the successor if he dies

1843
01:05:38,719 --> 01:05:44,558
he has a son

1844
01:05:40,318 --> 01:05:47,679
a first son born 2009 and not

1845
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:50,319
not old enough if he dies now so

1846
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:52,399
either his sister might rule for of

1847
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:54,318
short amount time as not like a leader

1848
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,200
but like replay like

1849
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,519
temporary placement and then when the

1850
01:05:57,199 --> 01:05:59,199
sun

1851
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:00,559
is old enough he might take it off

1852
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:02,480
because it's a kingdom

1853
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,599
that's most likely and china will do

1854
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:05,519
everything they can

1855
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:08,318
to maintain that status call for the

1856
01:06:05,519 --> 01:06:08,318
north korean regime

1857
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,880
so north korean people have no option

1858
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:15,039
here

1859
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:18,079
we just need some leader to courageously

1860
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:20,559
come up and do the right thing

1861
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:22,240
so we can't just wait this out no we

1862
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:24,880
can't it's not something that takes

1863
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:26,159
its course and not gonna change like we

1864
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:27,760
not even know that

1865
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:30,000
economic freedom does not bring

1866
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,400
political freedom we know in china

1867
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,280
it doesn't that's that's unique thing

1868
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,200
about freedom

1869
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:36,559
you gotta fight for it otherwise you

1870
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:39,118
don't never get it

1871
01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:41,119
freedom is something has to be fought

1872
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:43,680
and if nobody fighting for freedom it's

1873
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:45,599
not gonna be there

1874
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:47,838
can we talk a little bit about freedom

1875
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:51,200
what what does it mean to you

1876
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:54,000
having had we talked about love in

1877
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:54,480
that same way about freedom having sort

1878
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,599
of

1879
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:59,760
discovered it later in life what does it

1880
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:02,000
mean to you

1881
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,920
i think every day i i get a new

1882
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:06,960
definition of freedom

1883
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:09,838
it is it's a never-ending journey

1884
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,960
having this relationship with being free

1885
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:15,519
and what it means to be

1886
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:18,240
free right i think

1887
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:19,440
i think uh you definitely can live life

1888
01:07:18,239 --> 01:07:22,159
without being free

1889
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,720
and also happy life too i saw a lot of

1890
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:25,279
nursing

1891
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,480
elites who were were fed and have power

1892
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,359
but didn't have freedom were

1893
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:31,679
very happy in a way happier than the

1894
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:34,000
people that i found in yeo were like

1895
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:35,038
investment bankers and consultants in

1896
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,119
manhattan

1897
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,799
and seventy percent of them called like

1898
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,599
talk therapists

1899
01:07:38,798 --> 01:07:42,719
i was very confused i remember writing

1900
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,119
my book in new york

1901
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,719
like my editor was saying yeah me you

1902
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:49,280
know like you're traumatized

1903
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:51,279
you need to go talk to therapists and

1904
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:54,079
it's like what is therapy right

1905
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:55,839
what is trauma because in north korea

1906
01:07:54,079 --> 01:07:56,720
they don't have word for stress or

1907
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:58,400
trauma because

1908
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:00,719
how can you be stressed in the surgery

1909
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:04,000
is paradise so they don't let you be

1910
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:04,879
knowing what that is yes so and then

1911
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,199
they were like

1912
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,318
yeah hearing people having problems go

1913
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:10,558
talk to therapists

1914
01:08:08,318 --> 01:08:11,759
and i was like like how much is it

1915
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:13,920
actually like 200

1916
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:14,970
per hour and it's discounted rate too

1917
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,279
it's like no thank you

1918
01:08:14,969 --> 01:08:20,000
[Laughter]

1919
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:20,319
you know i was like you know and we know

1920
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,600
that

1921
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:27,039
freedom comes with responsibility

1922
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:27,759
and in a way it's not that easy to be

1923
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:30,880
free

1924
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,920
thinking for yourself constantly like

1925
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,838
when you

1926
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,838
in a way i understand like let's give

1927
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:37,679
government every power we have

1928
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:39,759
let them decide what education that i

1929
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,319
get let them decide where i live like

1930
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:42,560
you know

1931
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:44,640
let someone figure that out for me and

1932
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,560
that's how north korea began

1933
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,920
hoping the government gonna represent my

1934
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,560
own interest

1935
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,279
believing that they were good and with

1936
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,960
that

1937
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:54,719
benefit of thought and good faith you

1938
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:58,239
began the nightmare right

1939
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:59,600
yeah so freedom is not like a gay way to

1940
01:08:58,238 --> 01:09:01,198
be happy at all

1941
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,239
in a way you can make life a lot more

1942
01:09:01,198 --> 01:09:06,399
complex but then it's fun

1943
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:07,919
isn't it you start being for yourself

1944
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:10,639
you start making mistakes

1945
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:12,798
and it's so fun to be free even though

1946
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:14,798
you can be suffering way more

1947
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:16,319
than the people who are not free the

1948
01:09:14,798 --> 01:09:18,560
thing about freedom is

1949
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,159
when you have freedom you also have the

1950
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,039
responsibility for your actions

1951
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:23,599
and that could be a huge burden yeah

1952
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:27,439
because

1953
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:30,640
um if you succeed it's you

1954
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:32,960
but if you fail it's you yeah and

1955
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:34,159
uh if you do horrible things it's you if

1956
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,079
you don't do something

1957
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:37,198
for example if you don't help people in

1958
01:09:36,079 --> 01:09:40,318
north korea it's you

1959
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:43,439
yeah and that's a huge burden yeah

1960
01:09:40,319 --> 01:09:44,000
and living with that burden is a kind of

1961
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,838
suffering

1962
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:48,079
i mean there's some aspect in which

1963
01:09:45,838 --> 01:09:49,679
freedom is suffering it is suffering

1964
01:09:48,079 --> 01:09:51,600
because life is suffering and then

1965
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:54,560
freedom is uh

1966
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:56,079
you as an individual fully living

1967
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,760
through that

1968
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:00,000
so you talked you're friends with

1969
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:02,480
michael malus

1970
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:04,000
he believes and so i want to kind of ask

1971
01:10:02,479 --> 01:10:06,559
you about government

1972
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,800
he believes he's an anarchist and he

1973
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:12,239
believes kind of in

1974
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:15,760
freedom fully implemented in

1975
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:18,079
in human societies meaning that humans

1976
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,079
should

1977
01:10:18,319 --> 01:10:24,559
all be free to choose how they

1978
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,679
um you know transact with each other how

1979
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:28,080
they live together

1980
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:30,239
there shouldn't be a centralized force

1981
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:32,158
that tells you what to do

1982
01:10:30,238 --> 01:10:33,599
do you think there's some role for

1983
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:36,639
government

1984
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:38,719
in um in a healthy society yeah so

1985
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:41,360
you if we look at north korea there's

1986
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:44,719
the most horrible implementation

1987
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:46,399
of government but then if we

1988
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:48,079
look at what the united states strives

1989
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:51,359
to be at least

1990
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:53,119
in principle there's uh there's an

1991
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:54,880
ideal of a government that represents

1992
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:56,640
the people and helps the people like is

1993
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:57,279
there is there a place for that kind of

1994
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:58,800
ideal

1995
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,639
or is government always going to get us

1996
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,600
into trouble i

1997
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:04,640
am not i mean i spoke to michael males i

1998
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,120
kept asking

1999
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:10,079
why he's anarchist right and he doesn't

2000
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:11,760
believe in military none of that

2001
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,359
and it's i was like i was like i don't

2002
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:15,840
think i want to be in that world

2003
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:17,920
you're describing me that's pretty scary

2004
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:21,039
i want the law enforcement

2005
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:25,199
i want like i don't

2006
01:11:21,039 --> 01:11:26,238
in a way that so why equality makes no

2007
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:28,238
sense is that

2008
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:29,919
the fact that when you and i were born

2009
01:11:28,238 --> 01:11:31,599
we were born in a very different

2010
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,119
capability of thinking

2011
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:35,360
different intelligence different

2012
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,599
capability in our physics right

2013
01:11:35,359 --> 01:11:39,198
so equality is nonsense you can never

2014
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:42,640
achieve that

2015
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:43,439
right so to me that's when it's very

2016
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:45,360
scary

2017
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:47,599
when the government tries to interforce

2018
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:49,519
equality on everybody that is

2019
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:50,880
impossible that's specifically equality

2020
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,640
of outcomes so like

2021
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,319
so given that we all started different

2022
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,800
places enforce

2023
01:11:54,319 --> 01:11:59,039
like measure in some kind of way where

2024
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,159
people stand and if they're on equal in

2025
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:01,840
force equality

2026
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:03,679
yeah and that's what leads to the kind

2027
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:04,800
of things that you mentioned with the

2028
01:12:03,679 --> 01:12:08,079
class system

2029
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:08,880
right in north korea yeah so i think

2030
01:12:08,079 --> 01:12:11,359
that's why

2031
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,000
government can be bad they can be very

2032
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:14,158
dumb and

2033
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:16,479
another another thing is that they

2034
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:17,920
cannot know what you want a lot of times

2035
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:19,439
people don't even know what they want

2036
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:21,279
any individual

2037
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:23,198
like how the heck do you assume

2038
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:23,759
government gonna know what is best for

2039
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:27,279
you

2040
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:29,280
nobody knows we just all do our best

2041
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:30,800
i do think that some governments against

2042
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:32,639
switzerland

2043
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,079
you know have more give power to the

2044
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,239
different state

2045
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,319
can be good i think i'm more you know

2046
01:12:36,238 --> 01:12:40,319
like giving power to the state

2047
01:12:38,319 --> 01:12:42,319
and let individuals decide where they

2048
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:45,198
want to go in within states or

2049
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:46,479
i mean why did you choose taxes right

2050
01:12:45,198 --> 01:12:48,399
there's no

2051
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:50,399
income tax right like there's a lot of

2052
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:52,079
things people find texas

2053
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:54,238
like you know charming and they come

2054
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:56,079
here so in a way that

2055
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:57,599
i don't want to be in a one strong

2056
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:00,238
garment it makes

2057
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,760
every single thing the same way in a way

2058
01:13:00,238 --> 01:13:04,879
i want to kind of experiment

2059
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:07,520
everything you can have anarchy state

2060
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:08,079
there's no police nothing going on you

2061
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,480
can be

2062
01:13:08,079 --> 01:13:11,840
whatever one you want and you can go on

2063
01:13:10,479 --> 01:13:14,158
a stable it's like

2064
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,039
abortion is bad blah blah this is bad

2065
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:18,158
all these

2066
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:18,800
conservative values and let the ideas

2067
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:20,399
compete

2068
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,400
and let them how they are being tracked

2069
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:25,359
in real real life

2070
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:26,960
but i think it's very scary when the

2071
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:28,479
youth government is getting bigger and

2072
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:31,039
bigger and then they try

2073
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:32,399
to you know make every state under one

2074
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:34,158
big government

2075
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,719
and that's like when i get really

2076
01:13:34,158 --> 01:13:37,759
alarmed are there things that you see in

2077
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:41,359
the united states

2078
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:43,679
in the current culture that kind of has

2079
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,639
echoes of the same things you saw in

2080
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:48,719
north korea

2081
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:51,920
that that worry you that much

2082
01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:54,158
absolutely it's it's uh

2083
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:55,760
it's in america now the meritocracy

2084
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:58,399
doesn't matter right it's evil

2085
01:13:55,760 --> 01:14:00,079
the white man's idea of like talking

2086
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:01,839
about if you're

2087
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,760
competent enough they said oh if you're

2088
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,760
coming from which white family

2089
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:07,119
you are going to be competent so other

2090
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:09,760
people don't have a chance but

2091
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:11,439
look at asians who came from nothing is

2092
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,360
competent and go to like harvard law

2093
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:16,238
school and medical school

2094
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:18,319
so it doesn't almost it's like there's

2095
01:14:16,238 --> 01:14:20,479
no incentive for you to work hard

2096
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:22,158
anymore in the system right now that is

2097
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:23,198
north korea there's no incentive because

2098
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:26,000
you're born

2099
01:14:23,198 --> 01:14:27,919
with your class already so no matter

2100
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:29,439
what you do you can never so

2101
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:31,679
the horrible thing about north korean

2102
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:34,479
system is that there is nothing even

2103
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,679
holding mary up so if you're coming from

2104
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:37,678
other cultures

2105
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:39,679
that like mega marco join the royal

2106
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:42,480
family and she became a lawyer you go

2107
01:14:39,679 --> 01:14:44,399
up by north korea if someone from high

2108
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:46,799
class is going to marry somebody down

2109
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:47,839
you only go down with them that's how

2110
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,719
they prevent

2111
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,560
classmates right they that kind of

2112
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:55,920
enforces the separation because there's

2113
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,560
huge disincentives to go uh to marry to

2114
01:14:55,920 --> 01:15:00,158
to

2115
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:02,880
integrate between classes yeah

2116
01:15:00,158 --> 01:15:03,198
what do you do about this kind of um you

2117
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,800
know

2118
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,559
especially in universities but in

2119
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,480
companies i'm

2120
01:15:06,560 --> 01:15:10,080
thinking about starting a company so i'm

2121
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:13,119
looking at this very carefully

2122
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:16,238
there's these ideas of diversity

2123
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:19,439
and and meritocracy that's a tension so

2124
01:15:16,238 --> 01:15:21,759
yeah i think there's

2125
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:23,198
there's a big way in which diversity

2126
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:26,239
broadly defined

2127
01:15:23,198 --> 01:15:30,399
is not at all in in tension with

2128
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:31,119
meritocracy so having a variety of

2129
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:33,039
people

2130
01:15:31,119 --> 01:15:36,559
backgrounds way of thinking all those

2131
01:15:33,039 --> 01:15:39,119
kinds of things is a huge benefit to any

2132
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,159
group but the way diversity is often

2133
01:15:39,119 --> 01:15:43,599
defined

2134
01:15:40,158 --> 01:15:45,839
is by sort of very crude classes

2135
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:46,880
of people whether it's by skin color or

2136
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,520
gender

2137
01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:50,319
or or or some very kind of large group

2138
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,000
way

2139
01:15:50,319 --> 01:15:56,639
and that that actually does two things

2140
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,600
in my mind one it drowns out real

2141
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,400
diversity

2142
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:01,199
or not real but the full spectrum of

2143
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:03,599
diversity

2144
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:04,639
which is like within class diversity of

2145
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:08,480
like

2146
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:11,360
um are you are you somebody

2147
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:11,359
who is um

2148
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:14,239
are you somebody who's exceptionally

2149
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:15,840
good at mathematics are you somebody

2150
01:16:14,238 --> 01:16:16,959
who's exceptionally good at psychology

2151
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,640
are you good with people

2152
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:21,679
are you good with numbers all that kind

2153
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:24,320
of stuff that i think spans

2154
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:25,359
or intersects in fascinating ways with

2155
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:28,158
these kinds of groups

2156
01:16:25,359 --> 01:16:29,039
so that's diversity and then meritocracy

2157
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,079
is this

2158
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:33,920
thing that probably the reason i wanted

2159
01:16:32,079 --> 01:16:35,359
to move to silicon valley and the reason

2160
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:37,920
i didn't is like

2161
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:38,880
having a fire to change the world within

2162
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:40,800
you like

2163
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:41,920
meritocracy is like i want to be the

2164
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,960
best in the world

2165
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,640
at this and i will strive and work hard

2166
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:48,560
not stepping on others but like

2167
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,079
in purely within yourself be the best

2168
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:53,120
version of yourself

2169
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:56,319
that that idea is

2170
01:16:53,119 --> 01:17:00,238
um in some ways being

2171
01:16:56,319 --> 01:17:02,559
not celebrated or demonized

2172
01:17:00,238 --> 01:17:04,559
is it literally meritocracy is being

2173
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,600
demonized right now in america

2174
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:10,560
working hard is a symbol of you

2175
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,239
coming from some established family yeah

2176
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:15,199
the fact that you celebrate

2177
01:17:12,238 --> 01:17:16,158
accomplishment hard work is a sign of

2178
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:18,238
your

2179
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:20,238
patriarchy whatever thing they call

2180
01:17:18,238 --> 01:17:22,799
right and

2181
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:23,519
they want to abolish that they they want

2182
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:26,239
to like stop

2183
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,280
giving kids grace that's what they're

2184
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:29,519
already doing right they

2185
01:17:27,279 --> 01:17:32,158
want to stop they want like we should

2186
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,520
abolish like s 18 in america they take

2187
01:17:32,158 --> 01:17:35,119
to go to college right

2188
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,600
they won't even abolish this because

2189
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:39,760
yeah some keep kids have no ability to

2190
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:42,000
do math so why do we have to force them

2191
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:44,719
to learn math and that's what comes with

2192
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:46,319
humans overcome challenges yeah that's

2193
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:48,000
what makes us special

2194
01:17:46,319 --> 01:17:49,840
but then like because these kids coming

2195
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,719
from this family let's find a reason why

2196
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,840
they cannot

2197
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,679
and then they don't have to do that

2198
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,119
thing but they still deserve the same

2199
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:58,480
job they need to be a lawyer

2200
01:17:55,119 --> 01:18:01,519
and doctors yeah and that's like what

2201
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:03,439
in north korea was like not there was

2202
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,000
not even meritocracy to begin with right

2203
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:05,678
you

2204
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,359
these people in the same family the

2205
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:10,480
family the blood right

2206
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:13,039
like if one person does something wrong

2207
01:18:10,479 --> 01:18:14,079
it's like collective guilt because i

2208
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:15,760
spoke out

2209
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,079
three generations of my family got

2210
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:20,239
punished who are left behind

2211
01:18:18,079 --> 01:18:21,519
and then in america i see the same thing

2212
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:24,000
like if you're

2213
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,040
somehow great great grandfather on the

2214
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:28,079
slave

2215
01:18:25,039 --> 01:18:29,920
now you are privileged and you're guilty

2216
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:32,399
because you are white and geared then

2217
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:35,520
but how do you change your ancestor

2218
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:37,920
how did you have a saying on it and that

2219
01:18:35,520 --> 01:18:40,159
is where there's no way out there's no

2220
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:42,399
forgiving there's moving forward

2221
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:43,599
and this current culture in america now

2222
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:46,479
like i remember

2223
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:48,480
at columbia like before class everybody

2224
01:18:46,479 --> 01:18:51,519
have to go around of saying

2225
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:53,119
tell us what your pronoun is and

2226
01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:54,719
my english might third language i

2227
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:57,519
learned as an adult

2228
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,039
even saying he and she i'm confused by

2229
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:01,199
this is a pure mistake

2230
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:03,600
and they say call me day because i'm

2231
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:05,759
gender fluid basically i can be a girl

2232
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,360
but next hour you talk to me i'm a boy

2233
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:09,119
right yeah

2234
01:19:07,359 --> 01:19:10,960
and if you don't do it right they like

2235
01:19:09,119 --> 01:19:14,319
look at you why are you big at

2236
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:15,279
right it makes me so nervous and this is

2237
01:19:14,319 --> 01:19:18,479
where i come to

2238
01:19:15,279 --> 01:19:21,519
this is a regression of civilization

2239
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:23,678
we are regressing as a humanity here

2240
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,800
like the enlightenment all of those

2241
01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,119
things made us so much

2242
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,560
brighter and looking forward and now we

2243
01:19:27,119 --> 01:19:30,399
are going backwards

2244
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,159
well i think it's there's a pendulum

2245
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:33,519
aspect to it because it's my it's my

2246
01:19:32,158 --> 01:19:35,679
hope in terms of backwards so

2247
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:37,440
pendulum goes backwards too but it just

2248
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:39,840
goes back and forth i think

2249
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,519
and then uh in the long arc of history

2250
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:44,079
we're making progress

2251
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,120
i think all of the discussions of

2252
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,519
diversity and

2253
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:49,198
inclusion and all those kinds of things

2254
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,080
i always thought that they're healthy

2255
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:54,559
in a in moderation right they should be

2256
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:57,679
a small part of the conversation amongst

2257
01:19:54,560 --> 01:20:00,159
other things the the natural asp

2258
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:01,600
like it seems that they kind of have

2259
01:20:00,158 --> 01:20:02,879
this way of just consuming all

2260
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:05,440
conversations

2261
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:07,679
it's like the meetings like diversity

2262
01:20:05,439 --> 01:20:08,960
and inclusion meetings multiply somehow

2263
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:11,039
where it's like the only thing that

2264
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:13,039
you're talking about it's very kind of

2265
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:15,840
absurd and when i look at uh

2266
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:17,359
even at mit it's it's it's a strangely

2267
01:20:15,840 --> 01:20:20,400
disproportionate

2268
01:20:17,359 --> 01:20:22,880
amount of discussions about that and

2269
01:20:20,399 --> 01:20:24,719
also to me as an engineer those

2270
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:25,920
discussions are very frustrating because

2271
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:29,039
they don't seem to actually

2272
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:32,480
do anything no so like they want

2273
01:20:29,039 --> 01:20:35,359
to uh bully people yeah

2274
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:36,158
instead of creating systems that fix

2275
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:39,519
define

2276
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:41,599
like definitive problems and

2277
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,719
that in itself that kind of bullying

2278
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,120
that's the same kind of

2279
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:46,158
thing you saw in terms of mccarthyism in

2280
01:20:45,119 --> 01:20:47,920
america

2281
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:49,519
against the communists you certainly saw

2282
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:51,920
that in soviet union

2283
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:53,520
against everybody who's not communist

2284
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:56,158
it's uh it creates

2285
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:57,600
hate not progress when you talk to

2286
01:20:56,158 --> 01:20:58,719
jordan peterson recently and

2287
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:01,360
people should listen to that

2288
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:05,119
conversation it was a fascinating one

2289
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:08,158
i think um he

2290
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:09,439
he almost got emotional on the

2291
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:11,279
discussion about

2292
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,719
universities and your experience with

2293
01:21:11,279 --> 01:21:15,439
colombia

2294
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:17,198
because he like myself for perhaps

2295
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:20,079
different reasons have a hope

2296
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:21,759
for our academic institutions some of

2297
01:21:20,079 --> 01:21:24,960
the most incredible people some of

2298
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,639
the most incredible engineering and idea

2299
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,079
development innovations happens in

2300
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:31,920
universities and so

2301
01:21:28,079 --> 01:21:34,719
we both deeply care about them um

2302
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:36,880
is there something so the reason he got

2303
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,480
emotional the reason he was kind of hurt

2304
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:42,000
is

2305
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:42,879
the the the fact that you did not you

2306
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,279
were not

2307
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,239
deeply inspired by your experience

2308
01:21:45,279 --> 01:21:49,599
deeply

2309
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:51,678
it made me dumber it made me scared it

2310
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,639
made me terrified

2311
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:55,119
that i had to censor myself in america

2312
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:57,679
like

2313
01:21:55,119 --> 01:21:59,679
like are you seriously telling me that

2314
01:21:57,679 --> 01:22:00,239
you don't ever censor yourself and when

2315
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:02,319
you talk

2316
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:04,638
do you can you truly say whatever you

2317
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:08,079
want about race

2318
01:22:04,639 --> 01:22:10,079
of anything gender we all censor

2319
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:13,439
ourselves let's be honest right we

2320
01:22:10,079 --> 01:22:14,559
are all doing that and that's what i

2321
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:16,399
learned like

2322
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:18,159
i thought i was coming to country where

2323
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:19,119
i never needed it like first thing my

2324
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:21,759
mom taught me

2325
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:22,479
growing up in north korea was don't even

2326
01:22:21,760 --> 01:22:24,639
whisper

2327
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:26,479
because the birds and mice could hear

2328
01:22:24,639 --> 01:22:28,560
you

2329
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:30,319
and i thought okay now america is a

2330
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,960
truly the land of the free home of the

2331
01:22:30,319 --> 01:22:33,679
brave

2332
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,239
you can say anything you want and then

2333
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:36,639
you have

2334
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:37,279
freedom to change your mind and evolve

2335
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:39,440
right

2336
01:22:37,279 --> 01:22:41,759
but the people now demand you to be the

2337
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:44,158
perfect version they demand you to be

2338
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,920
you cannot change your mind and then

2339
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:46,879
what is the meaning of life you cannot

2340
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:48,719
grow

2341
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,480
right you should be feel safe to talk

2342
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:52,719
about anything and then later okay

2343
01:22:50,479 --> 01:22:54,959
i was wrong but now if you do that you

2344
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,800
gotta like get penalized for it

2345
01:22:54,960 --> 01:22:58,960
i mean censorship is a funny thing

2346
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:59,840
because you probably should not say dumb

2347
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:02,319
things

2348
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,239
you should try to say things you want to

2349
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:06,479
say in the most eloquent the most

2350
01:23:04,238 --> 01:23:07,359
effective way you can so i mean that's

2351
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:10,638
what editing is

2352
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:12,559
right yeah so there's some level of like

2353
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:14,400
being careful with what you say not

2354
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:17,440
because you're afraid

2355
01:23:14,399 --> 01:23:19,599
of some overarching kind of group

2356
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,439
of bullies but you want to be the best

2357
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,000
version of yourself when you express

2358
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:23,678
stuff

2359
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:25,119
but there's some sense where in the

2360
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:27,520
university setting

2361
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:28,960
you can put that self-censorship like

2362
01:23:27,520 --> 01:23:31,600
level down more

2363
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,399
and say stupid stuff right and explain

2364
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:34,079
and play

2365
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:35,759
because you should be forgiven for that

2366
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:36,960
kind of uh play

2367
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:39,600
especially when you're discussing

2368
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,079
difficult aspects of human history

2369
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:43,360
whether

2370
01:23:40,079 --> 01:23:44,880
that include racism that that include uh

2371
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:47,119
atrocities

2372
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:48,000
i'm still nevertheless sort of hopeful

2373
01:23:47,119 --> 01:23:51,840
but at the same

2374
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:53,600
time i'm i'm surrounded by engineers

2375
01:23:51,840 --> 01:23:55,520
yeah so i don't get to interact with

2376
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:58,719
people in humanities much

2377
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:02,159
and it seems like there's a good thing

2378
01:23:58,719 --> 01:24:05,359
it's a good thing i i

2379
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:06,879
yeah i don't know um well i do sort of

2380
01:24:05,359 --> 01:24:08,960
interact with psychologists but they

2381
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:09,359
haven't touched on those kinds of topics

2382
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,719
yet i

2383
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:16,158
i still sort of in defense of psychology

2384
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:18,719
i still i wish he had more numbers yeah

2385
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:20,319
uh but i still feel like most psychology

2386
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,158
people

2387
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:23,599
don't partake in this kind of stuff

2388
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:24,559
either they're just doing excellent

2389
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,480
research

2390
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,600
we're just highlighting this what

2391
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:29,599
america does well

2392
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:31,440
you're kind of highlighting anecdotal

2393
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:35,760
experiences

2394
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:37,519
and uh making a big deal out of them

2395
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:38,800
but that's good because like it's a

2396
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:40,560
slippery slope if those

2397
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,079
if those things start to overtake all of

2398
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:44,320
academia it starts becoming a big

2399
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:46,559
problem even in the engineering field so

2400
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:48,719
we should be concerned but it is truly

2401
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,280
tragic that somebody who's

2402
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:54,399
exceptionally well read like you whose

2403
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:56,719
fire was stoked first with orwell

2404
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:59,039
that fire should burn bright like this

2405
01:24:56,719 --> 01:25:01,840
should not be

2406
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:03,359
you should be writing many books you

2407
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:05,760
know what i mean like and

2408
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,799
you'll be you talk to jordan you know

2409
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:08,159
it's very possible

2410
01:25:06,800 --> 01:25:10,079
depending what you want to do with your

2411
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:10,799
life that you'll be a future jordan

2412
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:13,840
peterson

2413
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:17,760
right so like that and colombia

2414
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:20,319
should be a place that enriches

2415
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:20,880
that your mind and the fact that it

2416
01:25:20,319 --> 01:25:24,479
didn't is

2417
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:25,279
is tragic it's like i was there four

2418
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:27,359
years

2419
01:25:25,279 --> 01:25:28,800
it wasn't like i had one class that was

2420
01:25:27,359 --> 01:25:30,880
bad in a one semester

2421
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,279
yeah that was the thing i mean dr peter

2422
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:35,679
was asking is there any one class

2423
01:25:33,279 --> 01:25:37,679
that had no sentiment of this this

2424
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:41,359
virtue signatory and politically right

2425
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:44,560
yeah there was none yeah

2426
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:48,158
entire course i think i took 126

2427
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:49,760
credits total yeah not even one class

2428
01:25:48,158 --> 01:25:51,920
doesn't matter we were talking about

2429
01:25:49,760 --> 01:25:53,760
classic art and that's the thing

2430
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:55,679
i literally thought okay i pushed it

2431
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:57,119
last like the semester the call like the

2432
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:58,319
art and music right

2433
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:00,000
so i thought this is going to be the

2434
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,960
least politically correct class i can

2435
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:03,600
take

2436
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,239
and then it begins with who has problem

2437
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,760
with

2438
01:26:04,238 --> 01:26:08,479
calling this course the western

2439
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:10,719
civilization muse of art and music

2440
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:12,319
and everyone's raising their hands

2441
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:14,800
because like why do you have to learning

2442
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:17,759
about this better than mozart the bigots

2443
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:19,679
and all the people like you know

2444
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:23,119
everything ruined by white men

2445
01:26:19,679 --> 01:26:24,719
yeah and it's even music even these

2446
01:26:23,119 --> 01:26:26,880
paintings

2447
01:26:24,719 --> 01:26:28,158
and as i i didn't raise my hand

2448
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:29,920
everyone's looking at me

2449
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:32,319
how do you not have a problem with us

2450
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:35,520
like you used to hate us you're asian

2451
01:26:32,319 --> 01:26:36,000
you're so i think that's the thing is i

2452
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,760
think the

2453
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:39,679
problems way deeper than what people

2454
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:42,000
think and it's

2455
01:26:39,679 --> 01:26:43,520
it's so that's what i when i learned

2456
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:46,158
it's like

2457
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:47,600
it's not that safe in america we can go

2458
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:51,039
complete to the south

2459
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:53,120
and looking at even europe that is like

2460
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,960
i used to be way more optimistic like

2461
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:57,599
you know that but now

2462
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:58,719
i actually see wow this country can go

2463
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,120
to south

2464
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,239
and we might if u.s force land right

2465
01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:04,238
this is the only country

2466
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:05,678
left to battle with the common spot in

2467
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:08,479
china

2468
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:10,158
we may lose the opportunity to be free

2469
01:27:08,479 --> 01:27:13,119
ever again as a humanity

2470
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:15,119
wow so i mean that puts a lot of value

2471
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:18,000
on having these kinds of conversations

2472
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,840
it is i mean i'm troubled i'm troubled

2473
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:22,639
by a lot of things but like censorship

2474
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:24,239
on youtube for example

2475
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:26,079
yeah it was very annoying to have to

2476
01:27:24,238 --> 01:27:28,479
listen to donald trump all the time

2477
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:30,559
like just like create drama like the

2478
01:27:28,479 --> 01:27:31,519
news cycle was completely drowned out by

2479
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:34,159
donald trump

2480
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:36,400
but like banning him from twitter it was

2481
01:27:34,158 --> 01:27:36,399
like

2482
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:42,239
that i that was that was scary for me

2483
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,480
because

2484
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:46,319
it's like that's a step towards the

2485
01:27:44,479 --> 01:27:48,638
direction where

2486
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:50,799
you're going to like where's that take

2487
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:52,800
us you're going to silence

2488
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,800
people then it's like jordan peterson is

2489
01:27:52,800 --> 01:27:56,079
next that's why we need to promote

2490
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:58,960
freedom of thinking

2491
01:27:56,079 --> 01:28:01,519
and speech right and one thing that i

2492
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:03,439
love about dr peterson is

2493
01:28:01,520 --> 01:28:05,120
humans he's psychologists right he talks

2494
01:28:03,439 --> 01:28:08,559
about we

2495
01:28:05,119 --> 01:28:10,238
we we think by talking yeah

2496
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:12,239
that's why when you go to therapy you

2497
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:14,000
talk and then you hear yourself and then

2498
01:28:12,238 --> 01:28:17,119
you think and you come up to the

2499
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,000
answer it's so important for humans to

2500
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:20,559
talk

2501
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:23,600
so we can think so when they say you

2502
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:25,440
cannot talk means you cannot think

2503
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:27,600
and they don't know the consequences of

2504
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:30,079
that and this is why

2505
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:31,520
i promote i want the freedom of speech

2506
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:34,639
even though it hurts

2507
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:37,520
ridiculous you know sometimes it can

2508
01:28:34,639 --> 01:28:39,600
it can be dangerous but the price the

2509
01:28:37,520 --> 01:28:41,440
alternative is so bad

2510
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,960
that we should take the you know make

2511
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:44,559
this trade-off everything has a

2512
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:47,039
trade-off in this world

2513
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:48,560
and it comes with a sacrifice right so i

2514
01:28:47,039 --> 01:28:50,880
think that's uh

2515
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,239
that's what i want to see in america but

2516
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:55,039
it's unfortunately like

2517
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:57,439
the people like you say who decides what

2518
01:28:55,039 --> 01:28:58,800
is hate speech what is dangerous

2519
01:28:57,439 --> 01:29:00,559
that's what what i've been getting

2520
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:03,600
scared because

2521
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:05,199
everybody's imperfect yeah how do you

2522
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,560
want to give the power to them and

2523
01:29:05,198 --> 01:29:08,319
they're going to decide

2524
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,679
today they might agree with me say okay

2525
01:29:08,319 --> 01:29:11,599
your speech is good

2526
01:29:09,679 --> 01:29:13,440
promo is good and then they might come

2527
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:15,600
back next year so you're probably

2528
01:29:13,439 --> 01:29:16,799
bad what are you gonna do when that

2529
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,360
happens to you

2530
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,480
we have to almost like get ideas out and

2531
01:29:19,359 --> 01:29:21,839
then play with them

2532
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:23,519
i think what's a really important

2533
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:24,639
component of that is forgiving each

2534
01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,840
other for

2535
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:31,359
like realizing the word different person

2536
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:34,079
day by day and certainly years later

2537
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:36,238
and i think some of that is both

2538
01:29:34,079 --> 01:29:36,880
cultural mechanisms of saying like we

2539
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:39,359
forgive

2540
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:40,159
each other for wrong ideas or not wrong

2541
01:29:39,359 --> 01:29:42,960
ideas but

2542
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:43,920
for who we are the the full evolution of

2543
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,279
the human being

2544
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:47,119
for the steps we've taken on that

2545
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:50,238
evolution and

2546
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:53,599
also creating mechanisms that

2547
01:29:50,238 --> 01:29:54,959
allow you to um allow

2548
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,280
us to forgive each other like for

2549
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:58,880
example on a twitter is like horrible

2550
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:01,519
with this because

2551
01:29:58,880 --> 01:30:03,520
one of the main viral ways that people

2552
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:06,159
create drama on twitter is like

2553
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,120
pulling up an old tweet that somebody

2554
01:30:06,158 --> 01:30:09,198
said right

2555
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:10,719
and then saying oh this is the guy that

2556
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:12,719
thinks that yeah

2557
01:30:10,719 --> 01:30:14,319
and but that's like the opposite of the

2558
01:30:12,719 --> 01:30:16,480
mechanisms we need

2559
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:19,759
to forgive ourselves forgive each other

2560
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:22,238
for the things we've said in the past

2561
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,280
um so part of that is the cultural part

2562
01:30:22,238 --> 01:30:26,638
of this is as

2563
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:29,599
is the um the technological um

2564
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:30,800
mechanisms you mentioned uh jordan

2565
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:32,000
jordan peterson you had a great

2566
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,039
conversation with him

2567
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:37,760
what uh what was chatting with him like

2568
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:39,359
i'm just i'm just curious because he's

2569
01:30:37,760 --> 01:30:40,800
deeply passionate especially on the

2570
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:42,559
soviet union side

2571
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:44,320
about the atrocities of these kinds of

2572
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:47,360
systems what was it like

2573
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:48,000
what did you um what did you agree with

2574
01:30:47,359 --> 01:30:51,439
him on

2575
01:30:48,000 --> 01:30:53,119
what did you disagree what were some

2576
01:30:51,439 --> 01:30:54,479
things you both kind of learned from

2577
01:30:53,119 --> 01:30:55,679
each other through that conversation do

2578
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:58,479
you think

2579
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:59,199
so here so my story the jordan period is

2580
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:02,158
not a

2581
01:30:59,198 --> 01:31:03,599
very long one so one day i was walking

2582
01:31:02,158 --> 01:31:06,000
down in chicago

2583
01:31:03,600 --> 01:31:06,719
and they were like a huge theater or

2584
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:09,279
sold out

2585
01:31:06,719 --> 01:31:10,399
he said big letter jordan peterson saw

2586
01:31:09,279 --> 01:31:12,158
that yeah

2587
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:13,759
and then it was a huge theory in the

2588
01:31:12,158 --> 01:31:16,079
middle of chicago right like

2589
01:31:13,760 --> 01:31:17,920
doesn't like comedian like who can be

2590
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:21,119
selling this entire thing out

2591
01:31:17,920 --> 01:31:23,199
at like 7 00 p.m and then with

2592
01:31:21,119 --> 01:31:24,319
my like ex-husband we were walking the

2593
01:31:23,198 --> 01:31:26,079
street

2594
01:31:24,319 --> 01:31:27,599
and then we saw people were like selling

2595
01:31:26,079 --> 01:31:30,238
those like tickets

2596
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:31,760
like and for a very higher price right

2597
01:31:30,238 --> 01:31:33,359
and then you want to take it and then he

2598
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:36,560
was like yeah sure

2599
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:39,679
and we went in it's packed

2600
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:42,560
and then i was just

01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,920
whatever that guy is doing is very

2623
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:26,239

2631
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:45,198
years later i got a book

2632
01:32:42,319 --> 01:32:47,198
and i was start reading his book and it

2633
01:32:45,198 --> 01:32:48,000
talks about it explains so much right

2634
01:32:47,198 --> 01:32:50,158
like now

2635
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,840
at columbia learn like everything gender

2636
01:32:50,158 --> 01:32:55,439
is like made of concept

2637
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:57,199
construct like the higher kills my men's

2638
01:32:55,439 --> 01:32:59,599
idea make the hierarchy

2639
01:32:57,198 --> 01:33:00,559
and he begins with the number one the

2640
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:02,960
the lobsters

2641
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:04,000
had the hierarchies evolution of history

2642
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:06,960
that is within

2643
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:07,600
us that we want a higher key rate and

2644
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,840
then

2645
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:10,639
chapter five about socialization of

2646
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,679
child

01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:14,480
you know how do you raise them and all

2648
01:33:13,679 --> 01:33:16,800
of it and then

2649
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:17,839
what's why telling the truth is matters

2650
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:20,880
right

2651
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:22,719
and there's a white like in it's

2652
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:24,000
entire twelve lessons i read it and i

2653
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:26,079
was like i'm

2654
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:28,079
i was so grateful that i'm alive with

2655
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:30,079
this like there's people always say

2656
01:33:28,079 --> 01:33:31,359
if socrates is alive how much would you

2657
01:33:30,079 --> 01:33:33,840
pay to have lunch with him

2658
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:34,960
that kind of thing right so for me was

2659
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:37,440
like okay

2660
01:33:34,960 --> 01:33:39,679
i'm like alive in the same contemporary

2661
01:33:37,439 --> 01:33:43,439
world one of the greatest singers of

2662
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:45,279
my entire generation and then like

2663
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:47,839
how much money you hang out with exactly

2664
01:33:45,279 --> 01:33:51,119
right how much money would i pay right

2665
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:53,520
no no limit amount yeah and

2666
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:55,119
i like reached out to michaela on her

2667
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:56,159
pockets on twitter and connected and

2668
01:33:55,119 --> 01:33:58,639
then one day she'll say

2669
01:33:56,158 --> 01:33:59,359
do you wanna go my father's podcast i

2670
01:33:58,639 --> 01:34:03,760
was like

2671
01:33:59,359 --> 01:34:06,880
what i was like of course and

2672
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:08,239
i was very nervous but i didn't expect

2673
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:11,440
him to be

2674
01:34:08,238 --> 01:34:14,399
like that connected yeah because

2675
01:34:11,439 --> 01:34:16,158
i thought he was psychologists like he

2676
01:34:14,399 --> 01:34:17,279
saw so much suffering in the world he

2677
01:34:16,158 --> 01:34:19,439
started solving

2678
01:34:17,279 --> 01:34:21,359
his hobbies collecting those things to

2679
01:34:19,439 --> 01:34:22,238
remind him of the suffering of a human

2680
01:34:21,359 --> 01:34:24,960
being

2681
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:28,000
so sometimes some people hear so much

2682
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:31,279
atrocity they become like

2683
01:34:28,000 --> 01:34:32,000
very you know not engaged desensitized

2684
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:34,399
he felt

2685
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,920
he was feeling he was it's almost like

2686
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:37,359
he was living through the experiences

2687
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:39,119
with you as you were talking about it it

2688
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:40,799
was an amazing conversation

2689
01:34:39,119 --> 01:34:42,639
so jordan is one of the great thinkers

2690
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:45,440
of our time but i would say the greatest

2691
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:48,560
thinkers of our time is michael malus

2692
01:34:45,439 --> 01:34:50,319
you've also got to just talk to uh

2693
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,679
well so he wrote a book on north korea

2694
01:34:50,319 --> 01:34:53,920
yeah

2695
01:34:51,679 --> 01:34:54,719
it's an interesting style book i learned

2696
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:56,399
a lot from it

2697
01:34:54,719 --> 01:34:59,439
i learned a lot from michael about it

2698
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:02,559
and it's interesting that he chose

2699
01:34:59,439 --> 01:35:05,118
north korea as a as a thing to study

2700
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:06,880
that he of all people this fascinating

2701
01:35:05,118 --> 01:35:10,719
human being that is michael

2702
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:14,239
chose this darkest of aspects of

2703
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:16,639
of uh humanity to study what uh

2704
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:18,319
what do you think of michael what do you

2705
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:19,440
think of his book on north korea called

2706
01:35:18,319 --> 01:35:20,399
dear reader that people should

2707
01:35:19,439 --> 01:35:24,559
definitely check out

2708
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:26,000
absolutely so back then when i reached

2709
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,080
michael through mutual friends south

2710
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:31,198
korea i my english

2711
01:35:28,079 --> 01:35:33,840
wasn't good so i got a copy in my hand

2712
01:35:31,198 --> 01:35:35,919
i tried to read and a lot of them i

2713
01:35:33,840 --> 01:35:39,119
didn't understand

2714
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,840
so but i thought it was very fascinating

2715
01:35:39,118 --> 01:35:41,679
how he

2716
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:43,279
explained north korea through the deal

2717
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:45,920
leaders perspective

2718
01:35:43,279 --> 01:35:48,000
right as nobody has ever done that and

2719
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:50,480
you can reverse so much about the

2720
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,920
state and the absurdity of entire

2721
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:54,718
situation

2722
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:56,319
and also through humor and that's what's

2723
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,520
amazing about my chris is

2724
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:01,039
he knows the full gravity of tragedy

2725
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:03,280
he knows the first offering he's not

2726
01:36:01,039 --> 01:36:05,198
just like people here in america

2727
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:07,359
on the bus feed making fun of kim jones

2728
01:36:05,198 --> 01:36:08,000
haircut they don't care what people go

2729
01:36:07,359 --> 01:36:11,359
through

2730
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:13,920
michael cares deeply cares and then he

2731
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:16,799
still does ridiculous jokes

2732
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,239
so that that kind of reveals in a dark

2733
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:21,360
way the absurdity

2734
01:36:18,238 --> 01:36:23,039
yeah of evil yeah he does that

2735
01:36:21,359 --> 01:36:26,000
masterfully do you

2736
01:36:23,039 --> 01:36:26,399
he's a genius he is definitely all right

2737
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:30,158
let's

2738
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:32,238
let's if he watches this uh

2739
01:36:30,158 --> 01:36:33,599
you know let's not get make his head too

2740
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:37,198
big here

2741
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:37,199
but is there some aspect to

2742
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:41,280
i mean there is an absurdity to the

2743
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:44,000
whole thing yeah uh

2744
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:45,599
kim jong-un is this i mean he's almost

2745
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:47,760
like a caricature of evil

2746
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,360
like joke it's a joke a lot of people

2747
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:52,000
think it's a joke

2748
01:36:49,359 --> 01:36:54,238
they just think like this is too too

2749
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:55,920
absurd that is a they laugh

2750
01:36:54,238 --> 01:36:57,839
like can you imagine you laugh at

2751
01:36:55,920 --> 01:37:00,560
holocaust this is that

2752
01:36:57,840 --> 01:37:01,360
ridiculous can you maybe psychoanalyze

2753
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,080
that a little bit

2754
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:04,559
because that that's where my mind goes

2755
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:07,679
too

2756
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:10,000
like he's so ridiculous

2757
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:13,118
that you can't it's almost like hard to

2758
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:13,118
believe this is real

2759
01:37:14,639 --> 01:37:21,199
yeah is that just is that just my kind

2760
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:22,239
of and people's desire to escape the

2761
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:25,039
cruelty

2762
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:26,319
of reality by just kind of making a joke

2763
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:29,760
out of it

2764
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:33,279
i think it is a few things right like

2765
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:36,239
um to north korea as a nation

2766
01:37:33,279 --> 01:37:38,079
uh number one or number two smartest iq

2767
01:37:36,238 --> 01:37:41,919
people in the world

2768
01:37:38,079 --> 01:37:44,559
despite their magnitude so

2769
01:37:41,920 --> 01:37:46,399
so so there is i mean that that was

2770
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:49,520
that's an interesting point so

2771
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:52,238
in your sense the people are not dumb

2772
01:37:49,520 --> 01:37:54,000
still carry the the the brilliance

2773
01:37:52,238 --> 01:37:58,238
there's a there's a culture there

2774
01:37:54,000 --> 01:38:00,639
that's like hungry to become realized

2775
01:37:58,238 --> 01:38:03,118
like the people that that were like that

2776
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:03,600
that are silenced by the electricity by

2777
01:38:03,118 --> 01:38:05,359
the

2778
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,280
actually having no food all those kinds

2779
01:38:05,359 --> 01:38:08,799
of things like if you add the

2780
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:10,559
electricity if you add the food you're

2781
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,960
going to have a cultural center of the

2782
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,639
world

2783
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:15,439
like south korea that's what they

2784
01:38:12,639 --> 01:38:19,039
exactly did right the exact same career

2785
01:38:15,439 --> 01:38:21,839
one became one like 11th largest economy

2786
01:38:19,039 --> 01:38:23,118
one became the world's most like polish

2787
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:25,440
nation right

2788
01:38:23,118 --> 01:38:26,559
and this is a perfect example like if i

2789
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:30,000
don't know if you read that book

2790
01:38:26,560 --> 01:38:32,000
why nation affairs the system

2791
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,479
it's not about the culture it's not

2792
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:37,679
about people it's not about iq

2793
01:38:34,479 --> 01:38:39,759
what makes us too different is a system

2794
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:40,960
south korea is north korea is a perfect

2795
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:43,280
example of that

2796
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:44,079
one is exact same capability we were

2797
01:38:43,279 --> 01:38:47,198
homogeneous

2798
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:47,920
like country same language tradition all

2799
01:38:47,198 --> 01:38:49,839
of that

2800
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:52,158
we gave them different system one is

2801
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:54,319
free democracy one dictatorship

2802
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:55,679
and came up with the biggest different

2803
01:38:54,319 --> 01:38:58,960
results

2804
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:59,840
and i think north korea reveres that to

2805
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,920
us

2806
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:04,159
it's not because we are great that we

2807
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:07,279
are living in this prosperity

2808
01:39:04,158 --> 01:39:10,559
free market the ideas gave us to this

2809
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:14,079
the system we built our ancestors spirit

2810
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:16,239
gave us this privilege it's not us

2811
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:18,479
nothing is about us being special here

2812
01:39:16,238 --> 01:39:20,238
right the system that we have is quite

2813
01:39:18,479 --> 01:39:22,638
special

2814
01:39:20,238 --> 01:39:25,118
and north korea proves that to us it

2815
01:39:22,639 --> 01:39:28,480
doesn't matter even if you're smart

2816
01:39:25,118 --> 01:39:29,839
it that's all irrelevant and i think

2817
01:39:28,479 --> 01:39:31,359
that's why

2818
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:32,880
people just keep denying that they want

2819
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:35,359
to feel special like because

2820
01:39:32,880 --> 01:39:37,760
i'm awesome i got all of this like no

2821
01:39:35,359 --> 01:39:39,679
it's not you you got this

2822
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:40,800
and when people say like i hate

2823
01:39:39,679 --> 01:39:42,880
capitalism it's like

2824
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,719
without capitalism how do you came up

2825
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:47,520
with this thing

2826
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:47,920
literally how did you come up with this

2827
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:52,159
the

2828
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:55,440
systems matter and they matter

2829
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:57,679
like um way more than

2830
01:39:55,439 --> 01:40:00,319
this individualistic society would like

2831
01:39:57,679 --> 01:40:00,319
to imagine

2832
01:40:01,279 --> 01:40:08,479
it is the most important thing you can

2833
01:40:02,960 --> 01:40:10,560
have in life choosing the right system

2834
01:40:08,479 --> 01:40:11,759
do you have a device for young people

2835
01:40:10,560 --> 01:40:14,320
today

2836
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:15,360
you've lived an incredible life and you

2837
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:18,399
have

2838
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:19,759
i hope an incredible life ahead of you

2839
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:22,559
what advice would you give to young

2840
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:26,239
people today high schoolers

2841
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:28,239
college students how to um

2842
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:30,959
be successful in their career maybe

2843
01:40:28,238 --> 01:40:34,839
successful in life

2844
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:38,000
last thing i want them to fear is guilty

2845
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:40,639
it's it doesn't do anything right

2846
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,118
so i hate when people talk about white

2847
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:42,719
gears

2848
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:44,479
it's like that doesn't make even any

2849
01:40:42,719 --> 01:40:46,719
sense right

2850
01:40:44,479 --> 01:40:47,919
i think the fact that they born with

2851
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:50,960
freedom

2852
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:53,118
is a blessing for all of us

2853
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:55,198
it's not like i want them to want to do

2854
01:40:53,118 --> 01:40:56,880
something because they are guilty

2855
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:59,279
i want them to do something because they

2856
01:40:56,880 --> 01:41:01,440
are grateful

2857
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:03,759
it is true like we are sitting here the

2858
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:06,559
fact why i have children is suffering

2859
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:07,199
having kids you don't sleep costly like

2860
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:11,199
so much

2861
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:13,599
work like any like logical rational mind

2862
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:15,839
you should never want children right

2863
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:17,600
like why would you do that to yourself

2864
01:41:15,840 --> 01:41:19,440
especially as a woman right yeah you

2865
01:41:17,600 --> 01:41:21,679
don't want to do that to yourself

2866
01:41:19,439 --> 01:41:22,719
but think think about like we are

2867
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:25,199
sitting here today

2868
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:26,319
two of us in this amazing technology

2869
01:41:25,198 --> 01:41:28,799
this country

2870
01:41:26,319 --> 01:41:30,319
because somebody in savannah hundreds

2871
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:32,719
thousands of years ago

2872
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:33,759
they're hunting berries and surviving

2873
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:35,760
cold

2874
01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:36,880
every suffering they can imagine they

2875
01:41:35,760 --> 01:41:40,079
fall for us

2876
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:43,279
that's how we ended up here so life

2877
01:41:40,079 --> 01:41:45,760
is ultimately bigger than us

2878
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:47,359
and i think that's what i want them it's

2879
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,400
not like i want them to do the right

2880
01:41:47,359 --> 01:41:50,799
thing and be the best

2881
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:52,479
person of themselves it's like i want

2882
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,239
them to feel grateful

2883
01:41:52,479 --> 01:41:56,559
and we should be very grateful for the

2884
01:41:54,238 --> 01:41:59,118
freedom and then take full and

2885
01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:00,480
advantage of that i mean it starts with

2886
01:41:59,118 --> 01:42:02,399
the freedom to experience

2887
01:42:00,479 --> 01:42:03,678
everything in life and for your life

2888
01:42:02,399 --> 01:42:06,960
literally like

2889
01:42:03,679 --> 01:42:09,760
how my father like

2890
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:11,439
you know working dying is a lot easier

2891
01:42:09,760 --> 01:42:13,840
than living

2892
01:42:11,439 --> 01:42:15,599
that takes like few minutes right

2893
01:42:13,840 --> 01:42:18,880
maximum

2894
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:19,600
and living takes forever so when i was

2895
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,239
facing this

2896
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:23,679
unbelievable challenge i thought okay

2897
01:42:22,238 --> 01:42:25,039
this most rational thing i can do is

2898
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:27,039
killing myself right now

2899
01:42:25,039 --> 01:42:28,960
but the hardest thing i can choose is

2900
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:31,198
choose to live

2901
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:33,198
and my father did that even in the

2902
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:33,839
consumption camp even no matter what he

2903
01:42:33,198 --> 01:42:37,759
said

2904
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:40,960
life is a gift you need to fight for it

2905
01:42:37,760 --> 01:42:43,920
and i think that's what's missing here

2906
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:44,480
that we don't think life as a gift it's

2907
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:47,199
a gift

2908
01:42:44,479 --> 01:42:48,799
like how many people had to fight for me

2909
01:42:47,198 --> 01:42:51,359
to be here today

2910
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:53,440
think about the sacrifice they made for

2911
01:42:51,359 --> 01:42:55,279
many many many generations i don't even

2912
01:42:53,439 --> 01:42:56,000
know what they went through i can't even

2913
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:59,439
fathom what they

2914
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:01,840
went through they fought for life yeah

2915
01:42:59,439 --> 01:43:03,359
and that is my responsibility enough so

2916
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:05,920
it doesn't make them

2917
01:43:03,359 --> 01:43:06,719
their fault fire was not meaningless

2918
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:08,719
right it meant

2919
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:10,560
something because now i'm carrying on

2920
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:15,198
that fight

2921
01:43:10,560 --> 01:43:15,199
you mentioned considering suicide

2922
01:43:15,279 --> 01:43:22,880
do you think about your mortality now

2923
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:25,679
now that you're perhaps in slightly

2924
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:26,079
more comfortable place you still think

2925
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:29,279
about

2926
01:43:26,079 --> 01:43:32,479
death i do because i

2927
01:43:29,279 --> 01:43:35,759
was informed actually when i was 21 that

2928
01:43:32,479 --> 01:43:40,799
i was on the killing list of kim jong-un

2929
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:43,280
in by south korean intelligence and then

2930
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:45,360
and then i i had to live with that right

2931
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:46,559
but now i actually feel more because i

2932
01:43:45,359 --> 01:43:48,799
don't know you

2933
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,600
follow jamal khashoggi's story the saudi

2934
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,600
journalist

2935
01:43:49,600 --> 01:43:53,199
who got chopped off in turkey canvas

2936
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:55,119
right

2937
01:43:53,198 --> 01:43:57,839
his reason why he got killed was he

2938
01:43:55,118 --> 01:44:00,639
became very prominent on twitter

2939
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:01,520
he had a huge voice and saudis followed

2940
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:04,239
him

2941
01:44:01,520 --> 01:44:07,040
now i became very first north korean to

2942
01:44:04,238 --> 01:44:09,039
have this many social media followings

2943
01:44:07,039 --> 01:44:11,439
and recently north korea started

2944
01:44:09,039 --> 01:44:14,079
invasion investigation team to

2945
01:44:11,439 --> 01:44:15,759
analyze whatever i do even though it's

2946
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:17,279
first time for them

2947
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,440
so they don't even know what at this

2948
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:22,479
point like they're like this is so new

2949
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:24,319
what do we do with kim jong-nam

2950
01:44:22,479 --> 01:44:26,959
kim jong-nam the half-brother kim

2951
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:28,960
jong-un got killed in malaysia

2952
01:44:26,960 --> 01:44:31,039
that is another tragedy that i feel so

2953
01:44:28,960 --> 01:44:33,039
sorry for the u.s government is that

2954
01:44:31,039 --> 01:44:36,479
kim jong-nam was giving information to

2955
01:44:33,039 --> 01:44:38,079
the cia for the past like 10 years

2956
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:40,238
that trip when he got killed in

2957
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:41,679
malaysian airport he was meeting up with

2958
01:44:40,238 --> 01:44:43,759
the cia agent for two days on the

2959
01:44:41,679 --> 01:44:45,920
northern ireland

2960
01:44:43,760 --> 01:44:48,719
cia could have protected them they

2961
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:51,199
didn't they let him die

2962
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:52,000
and who killed them north korean kim

2963
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:54,319
jong-un

2964
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,880
do you know the malaysian the ladies are

2965
01:44:54,319 --> 01:44:59,679
the vx the nerve agent

2966
01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:01,440
north koreans kill them in malaysia in

2967
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:03,359
the international land

2968
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:04,719
so i mean jamal khashoggi who was a

2969
01:45:03,359 --> 01:45:06,960
youth resident

2970
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:09,118
and the washington post journalist when

2971
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:12,000
he got killed in saudi like a lamb

2972
01:45:09,118 --> 01:45:12,319
they chopped them into pieces in that

2973
01:45:12,000 --> 01:45:14,719
most

2974
01:45:12,319 --> 01:45:15,840
inhumane death what was the consequences

2975
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:19,439
for the saudis

2976
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:20,239
nothing the word is we think we living

2977
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:22,559
in justice

2978
01:45:20,238 --> 01:45:25,039
country now there's no justice there is

2979
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:28,080
no accountability for killing any decent

2980
01:45:25,039 --> 01:45:28,840
no matter how big their names are so you

2981
01:45:28,079 --> 01:45:32,158
don't think

2982
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:33,199
you're vast and quickly growing social

2983
01:45:32,158 --> 01:45:36,238
media presence

2984
01:45:33,198 --> 01:45:39,039
protects you no it does opposite

2985
01:45:36,238 --> 01:45:40,479
because kim jong-un in german i spoke

2986
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:40,880
out i don't know if you went through it

2987
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:42,638
they

2988
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:44,560
did everything they could to

2989
01:45:42,639 --> 01:45:47,359
characterize assassinate me

2990
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:48,400
saying i'm a liar i'm a cia spy i get

2991
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:50,399
paid

2992
01:45:48,399 --> 01:45:52,238
and then they reach out to penguin

2993
01:45:50,399 --> 01:45:54,238
saying we're gonna blow up

2994
01:45:52,238 --> 01:45:55,678
you cannot write this book and they did

2995
01:45:54,238 --> 01:45:57,359
it with the sony they hacked the sony

2996
01:45:55,679 --> 01:45:58,719
studio for making that stupid movie

2997
01:45:57,359 --> 01:46:01,519
interview right

2998
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:02,079
and then penguin did their investigation

2999
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,080
they met

3000
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:06,158
every survivor that i went through in

3001
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:06,639
the desert they got the voice recording

3002
01:46:06,158 --> 01:46:07,920
of them

3003
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:09,840
because they don't want them to change

3004
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,719
their mind later right people remember

3005
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:12,480
differently

3006
01:46:10,719 --> 01:46:14,079
so they got the voice recordings like

3007
01:46:12,479 --> 01:46:14,879
the penguin regarding got the old

3008
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:16,719
audience

3009
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:18,000
and now we are ready for the lawsuit we

3010
01:46:16,719 --> 01:46:19,840
are going to publish this book

3011
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,920
because we checked to verify every

3012
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,840
single thing that was going in the book

3013
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:25,760
and north korea couldn't do anything

3014
01:46:23,840 --> 01:46:26,880
anymore but that's a character

3015
01:46:25,760 --> 01:46:29,039
assassination

3016
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:30,400
which by the way that's a whole nother

3017
01:46:29,039 --> 01:46:31,600
conversation that you were able to

3018
01:46:30,399 --> 01:46:33,039
survive that

3019
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:34,400
i appreciate the kind of strength it

3020
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:35,519
requires to survive that because you

3021
01:46:34,399 --> 01:46:38,000
don't know

3022
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,960
and your character being assassinated is

3023
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,520
in some ways

3024
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:42,639
can be as painful as actual

3025
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:45,119
assassination it's

3026
01:46:42,639 --> 01:46:46,400
worse everybody thinks you're a liar

3027
01:46:45,118 --> 01:46:49,118
yeah like everybody thinks

3028
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:50,158
you're a liar yeah and now everybody

3029
01:46:49,118 --> 01:46:52,559
like you said this

3030
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:54,319
nature of internet that as long as

3031
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:55,119
something is written internet they think

3032
01:46:54,319 --> 01:46:57,840
that's a fact

3033
01:46:55,118 --> 01:46:59,439
yeah any stupid person can start a blog

3034
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:01,520
and write about you

3035
01:46:59,439 --> 01:47:02,879
but they think oh because it's written

3036
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:04,320
on the internet it's a legit

3037
01:47:02,880 --> 01:47:06,159
especially negative stuff that's the

3038
01:47:04,319 --> 01:47:09,279
thing i was kind of trying to

3039
01:47:06,158 --> 01:47:12,079
elaborate on there's a viral aspect to

3040
01:47:09,279 --> 01:47:12,719
calling somebody a fraud or a liar yeah

3041
01:47:12,079 --> 01:47:14,079
that

3042
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:16,560
nobody questions whether it's true or

3043
01:47:14,079 --> 01:47:19,039
not it just spreads yeah it's a

3044
01:47:16,560 --> 01:47:20,719
it's a dark side of our human nature

3045
01:47:19,039 --> 01:47:23,840
that we want to destroy

3046
01:47:20,719 --> 01:47:26,399
yeah the people who are rising yeah

3047
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:28,159
we cannot stand it yeah yeah we any

3048
01:47:26,399 --> 01:47:29,679
change maker in this world who wasn't

3049
01:47:28,158 --> 01:47:31,519
controversial right martial

3050
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,199
engineer like nurse mandela he was

3051
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:36,480
called as a terrorist

3052
01:47:33,198 --> 01:47:39,039
right so i just did not know

3053
01:47:36,479 --> 01:47:40,158
i the character assassination is the

3054
01:47:39,039 --> 01:47:42,560
thing it'll probably

3055
01:47:40,158 --> 01:47:44,319
continue with you it will continue

3056
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,239
forever so you have to get stronger and

3057
01:47:44,319 --> 01:47:48,639
stronger i think in the face of that

3058
01:47:46,238 --> 01:47:50,319
but actual assassination and perhaps

3059
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:53,440
it's me being hopeful because

3060
01:47:50,319 --> 01:47:55,439
i have a situation with russia that i

3061
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:57,759
hope i'm not under

3062
01:47:55,439 --> 01:47:59,839
well i don't care actually but there's

3063
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:02,800
some aspect in which social media

3064
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:03,279
presence i thought protects you a little

3065
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:07,039
bit

3066
01:48:03,279 --> 01:48:09,359
because just imagine the outrage

3067
01:48:07,039 --> 01:48:10,719
from an attempted assassination

3068
01:48:09,359 --> 01:48:13,198
assassination of you

3069
01:48:10,719 --> 01:48:15,039
but what was our wage when drama koshki

3070
01:48:13,198 --> 01:48:17,839
got killed like that

3071
01:48:15,039 --> 01:48:19,279
was the social media presence large over

3072
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:20,480
one million people i don't have that

3073
01:48:19,279 --> 01:48:24,079
family

3074
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:26,559
he was 1.6 million twitter followers

3075
01:48:24,079 --> 01:48:27,279
and the outrage wasn't there no because

3076
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:30,960
saudis

3077
01:48:27,279 --> 01:48:32,559
spoke to amazon the prime studio netflix

3078
01:48:30,960 --> 01:48:34,399
there were people made a documentary

3079
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:37,360
about him but told everybody don't

3080
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:38,638
cannot get that deal so there was a huge

3081
01:48:37,359 --> 01:48:40,639
censorship on that

3082
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,920
and people of course like i mean they

3083
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:45,039
can talk about it one day

3084
01:48:41,920 --> 01:48:47,359
some distance from saudi got killed yeah

3085
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:48,960
horrible it just dissipates like they

3086
01:48:47,359 --> 01:48:50,479
they move on to the next cute puppy

3087
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:52,079
right they didn't execute cat like

3088
01:48:50,479 --> 01:48:55,118
that's what the nature of this

3089
01:48:52,079 --> 01:48:56,319
new generation does they desensitized it

3090
01:48:55,118 --> 01:48:59,039
doesn't affect them they

3091
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:00,238
keep following the instant pleasure

3092
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:02,238
instant high

3093
01:49:00,238 --> 01:49:03,359
that's what instagram does to you it

3094
01:49:02,238 --> 01:49:04,799
changes your brain

3095
01:49:03,359 --> 01:49:07,359
like that's why i always reminisce about

3096
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:07,920
the shallows we became shallow and

3097
01:49:07,359 --> 01:49:10,479
shallow

3098
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:12,399
and our brain changes permanently so

3099
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:14,000
this inner generation we can get them

3100
01:49:12,399 --> 01:49:16,799
angry for like 10 minutes

3101
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:18,000
create hashtags for one day but then as

3102
01:49:16,800 --> 01:49:21,119
quick as that was

3103
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,560
it goes down like instantly and i think

3104
01:49:21,118 --> 01:49:25,039
that's the

3105
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:26,159
well that means that okay so that means

3106
01:49:25,039 --> 01:49:28,800
that there is uh

3107
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:30,879
it's an effective way to get rid of

3108
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:33,119
opposition is by murdering them

3109
01:49:30,880 --> 01:49:35,599
and that means a united states if it

3110
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:38,319
stands for freedom if it stands for

3111
01:49:35,599 --> 01:49:39,199
the freedom of exchange of ideas should

3112
01:49:38,319 --> 01:49:40,519
be protecting

3113
01:49:39,198 --> 01:49:42,719
people like you but they because they

3114
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:44,639
don't want to be involved

3115
01:49:42,719 --> 01:49:46,639
they will they they they didn't even

3116
01:49:44,639 --> 01:49:49,279
protect kim jong-nam who was giving

3117
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:52,079
information 10 years to risk in his life

3118
01:49:49,279 --> 01:49:53,118
that's what is so i mean working for cia

3119
01:49:52,079 --> 01:49:56,479
is not bad

3120
01:49:53,118 --> 01:49:57,118
i'm not i don't i hope i mean the thing

3121
01:49:56,479 --> 01:49:59,039
is

3122
01:49:57,118 --> 01:50:01,598
he was giving information to bring down

3123
01:49:59,039 --> 01:50:03,359
the vision yeah that is valuable that is

3124
01:50:01,599 --> 01:50:05,599
something noble about him

3125
01:50:03,359 --> 01:50:06,559
but then you just don't go extra miles

3126
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:08,800
to that

3127
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:11,199
that's when i lost my faith in the u.s

3128
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:13,840
system as well like this country

3129
01:50:11,198 --> 01:50:14,238
just cares about saving face what is

3130
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:17,279
most

3131
01:50:14,238 --> 01:50:19,839
minimum because they pay for anything

3132
01:50:17,279 --> 01:50:21,840
and like i went up south korea

3133
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:23,119
constantly every single day intelligence

3134
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:24,960
calling me

3135
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:26,238
like the north korean agent going this

3136
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:29,439
place where are you going

3137
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:30,718
the u.s citizens came to us nobody

3138
01:50:29,439 --> 01:50:34,879
they said when people said that you're a

3139
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:34,880
cia agent like i wish they called me

3140
01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:38,800
i really truly do but nobody nobody does

3141
01:50:38,238 --> 01:50:40,879
here

3142
01:50:38,800 --> 01:50:43,199
i'm sure they know what's going on but

3143
01:50:40,880 --> 01:50:44,719
the south korean agent is more like

3144
01:50:43,198 --> 01:50:46,319
oh my gosh we don't want you to get

3145
01:50:44,719 --> 01:50:48,319
killed a south korean citizen right

3146
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:49,359
yeah and now i'm trying to become a

3147
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:51,679
citizen

3148
01:50:49,359 --> 01:50:53,279
so it's in a way it's i don't know

3149
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:56,960
what's worse

3150
01:50:53,279 --> 01:51:00,399
are you are you afraid for your life

3151
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:02,880
i was afraid for those ever three four

3152
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:04,960
years i was afraid and it was

3153
01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,239
but i had to came terms with it like in

3154
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:09,039
my enemy

3155
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:09,598
is not on some crazy psychopath it's a

3156
01:51:09,039 --> 01:51:11,679
state

3157
01:51:09,599 --> 01:51:13,520
with a new career power to attack the

3158
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:16,158
most powerful country

3159
01:51:13,520 --> 01:51:16,880
if kim jong-un decides if i die i'm

3160
01:51:16,158 --> 01:51:20,079
gonna die

3161
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:20,319
it's not up to me right so in a way it's

3162
01:51:20,079 --> 01:51:23,519
just

3163
01:51:20,319 --> 01:51:26,000
liberating that you it's like if you are

3164
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:27,760
like afraid of some mobs or some like

3165
01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,920
gangsters on the street

3166
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:31,599
it's almost like you have power over a

3167
01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:32,639
little bit you gotta be like thinking

3168
01:51:31,599 --> 01:51:34,880
that's my fault i

3169
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:36,159
i went that way right but when it comes

3170
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,319
to kim jong-un

3171
01:51:36,158 --> 01:51:39,439
i know like my enemy is so much bigger

3172
01:51:38,319 --> 01:51:41,759
than me

3173
01:51:39,439 --> 01:51:42,799
it's in always a liberation and also it

3174
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:46,480
always

3175
01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:47,679
i just i live a lot so i have seen a lot

3176
01:51:46,479 --> 01:51:49,598
i've seen everything

3177
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:51,199
i don't have that much yogurt left here

3178
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:52,159
like okay i'm going too soon you know

3179
01:51:51,198 --> 01:51:54,719
it's like okay

3180
01:51:52,158 --> 01:51:55,359
maybe it's time like death is a part of

3181
01:51:54,719 --> 01:51:58,560
life

3182
01:51:55,359 --> 01:51:59,679
so in some sense you're willing to

3183
01:51:58,560 --> 01:52:03,679
accept death

3184
01:51:59,679 --> 01:52:05,679
to keep fighting for freedom in your

3185
01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:07,359
in at least in part a place you call

3186
01:52:05,679 --> 01:52:09,599
home yeah

3187
01:52:07,359 --> 01:52:11,198
it is do you hope that one day you can

3188
01:52:09,599 --> 01:52:14,639
return to north korea

3189
01:52:11,198 --> 01:52:15,118
i hope so i hope i bring my son and tell

3190
01:52:14,639 --> 01:52:18,639
him this

3191
01:52:15,118 --> 01:52:21,359
is like where your ancestors from too

3192
01:52:18,639 --> 01:52:23,440
it would look very different than the

3193
01:52:21,359 --> 01:52:26,799
place you came from

3194
01:52:23,439 --> 01:52:28,799
in your as you hope

3195
01:52:26,800 --> 01:52:31,279
do you do you hope that there's a

3196
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:35,440
democracy one day

3197
01:52:31,279 --> 01:52:35,439
that north korea looks like south korea

3198
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:39,599
well that'll be in paradise right

3199
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:44,719
that's but i'm a rational optimist

3200
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:46,560
i'm not like just optimistic because i

3201
01:52:44,719 --> 01:52:48,960
have to be

3202
01:52:46,560 --> 01:52:50,880
i think as long as there are people who

3203
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:53,359
have changed the world right

3204
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:54,639
like who believed in something and

3205
01:52:53,359 --> 01:52:56,399
worked for it

3206
01:52:54,639 --> 01:52:58,079
and like i don't know like there's a

3207
01:52:56,399 --> 01:52:59,679
like alice she wrote a few people

3208
01:52:58,079 --> 01:53:04,158
holding entirely this word

3209
01:52:59,679 --> 01:53:06,000
right i really believe in that i think

3210
01:53:04,158 --> 01:53:07,279
as long as that continues that can

3211
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,599
happen in my country

3212
01:53:07,279 --> 01:53:11,359
as long as people like you someday you

3213
01:53:09,599 --> 01:53:12,560
want to decide to do something about

3214
01:53:11,359 --> 01:53:14,158
north korean working for

3215
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:16,480
using your brain power to solve this

3216
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:17,519
puzzle how fascinating would that be

3217
01:53:16,479 --> 01:53:20,638
that's why i

3218
01:53:17,520 --> 01:53:25,119
continue to speak continue to recruit

3219
01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:25,118
to inspire millions to do something

3220
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:29,039
the books you like are all the books i

3221
01:53:27,920 --> 01:53:30,880
love so

3222
01:53:29,039 --> 01:53:32,238
i have to mention this you mentioned uh

3223
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:34,639
briefly on the uh

3224
01:53:32,238 --> 01:53:35,519
with jordan uh siddhartha by herman

3225
01:53:34,639 --> 01:53:38,480
hesse

3226
01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:38,880
is uh it's an incredible book yeah

3227
01:53:38,479 --> 01:53:40,959
they're

3228
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:43,118
i mean i don't i don't know exactly what

3229
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:46,960
i want to ask here but there's some

3230
01:53:43,118 --> 01:53:49,519
i think the book kind of

3231
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,399
through telling a story yeah reveals

3232
01:53:49,520 --> 01:53:53,360
that

3233
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:54,559
life is suffering and yet there's beauty

3234
01:53:53,359 --> 01:53:58,479
in it the beauty in

3235
01:53:54,560 --> 01:54:02,239
every moment it uses kind of a river

3236
01:53:58,479 --> 01:54:03,839
painted metaphor is there is there um

3237
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:05,839
is there something that you could say

3238
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:07,599
speak to like how that book

3239
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:09,199
impacted your life and the way you live

3240
01:54:07,599 --> 01:54:11,520
life maybe the way you

3241
01:54:09,198 --> 01:54:13,039
see life whether it's on the life of

3242
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:16,080
suffering side or that

3243
01:54:13,039 --> 01:54:17,760
life is beautiful side i mean he goes

3244
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:19,519
the entire journey right

3245
01:54:17,760 --> 01:54:21,440
he goes in this state like i'm so

3246
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:23,440
enlightened that i cannot

3247
01:54:21,439 --> 01:54:24,638
deal with people they're in love and cry

3248
01:54:23,439 --> 01:54:26,879
about it

3249
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:28,480
right they're like that's so like

3250
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:31,920
primitive

3251
01:54:28,479 --> 01:54:33,118
once he has his own son he actually

3252
01:54:31,920 --> 01:54:35,118
being attached

3253
01:54:33,118 --> 01:54:36,639
he actually cares he actually really

3254
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:37,920
does whole thing

3255
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:41,599
right that's the thing that he used to

3256
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:43,840
think not once his son comes find him

3257
01:54:41,599 --> 01:54:45,679
he looks at life differently i think

3258
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:46,800
that's the thing i did have the kind of

3259
01:54:45,679 --> 01:54:51,039
journey where

3260
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:54,560
oh nothing matters right so bitter so

3261
01:54:51,039 --> 01:54:57,439
so like so cynical and

3262
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:59,199
after i met so many incred incredible

3263
01:54:57,439 --> 01:55:02,799
people i was talking about that

3264
01:54:59,198 --> 01:55:05,118
person who told me he was gay he told me

3265
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:06,400
i love you and i was like why do you

3266
01:55:05,118 --> 01:55:08,000
love me

3267
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:10,158
in the past people when they wanted me

3268
01:55:08,000 --> 01:55:11,760
was because they want to rape me

3269
01:55:10,158 --> 01:55:13,519
everybody wanted something for me that's

3270
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,840
why they wanted me

3271
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:17,760
and i never understood you can love

3272
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:19,679
somebody unconditionally

3273
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:20,960
and this gay guy the last one was going

3274
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:24,000
to sleep with me right

3275
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:26,000
and he loves me and i think

3276
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:27,279
i had a blessing after my journey

3277
01:55:26,000 --> 01:55:29,439
meeting people who

3278
01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:31,279
loved me unconditionally because i was

3279
01:55:29,439 --> 01:55:33,359
just being a human

3280
01:55:31,279 --> 01:55:35,679
and i think that's what it is now for me

3281
01:55:33,359 --> 01:55:38,799
that like him

3282
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:40,480
i live for love now i live for love any

3283
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:43,119
kind of love love for knowledge

3284
01:55:40,479 --> 01:55:44,638
i like i read so many books because i

3285
01:55:43,118 --> 01:55:47,359
love books right

3286
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:48,480
i love what i do i love my people i love

3287
01:55:47,359 --> 01:55:51,839
humanity

3288
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:53,598
you know even it sometimes annoys me

3289
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:55,520
i love myself and that's beautiful too

3290
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:57,279
the annoying parts are beautiful too

3291
01:55:55,520 --> 01:55:58,480
what do you let me ask the ridiculous

3292
01:55:57,279 --> 01:56:00,238
question what do you think is the

3293
01:55:58,479 --> 01:56:03,839
meaning of this whole thing

3294
01:56:00,238 --> 01:56:03,839
of uh what's the meaning of life

3295
01:56:05,198 --> 01:56:09,118
well i think at this point i stop

3296
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:10,880
questioning why i'm here

3297
01:56:09,118 --> 01:56:12,880
right like it doesn't matter someone put

3298
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:14,800
the atom there or the big bang

3299
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:16,079
i'm here that's truth right i'm going to

3300
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:18,159
accept that fully

3301
01:56:16,079 --> 01:56:20,000
so what instead of me keep asking the

3302
01:56:18,158 --> 01:56:22,399
impossible question what i'm here

3303
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:23,118
i'm going to let you do that science do

3304
01:56:22,399 --> 01:56:24,960
that right

3305
01:56:23,118 --> 01:56:28,000
you guys go out in the space and look

3306
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:29,840
for the evidence i'm contested

3307
01:56:28,000 --> 01:56:31,679
you accept that you're here and you're

3308
01:56:29,840 --> 01:56:34,159
just going to

3309
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:34,719
enjoy like you're here for love as you

3310
01:56:34,158 --> 01:56:37,439
said

3311
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:38,239
that's the thing i think i'm here for

3312
01:56:37,439 --> 01:56:40,238
the

3313
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:44,000
process of pursuing something bigger

3314
01:56:40,238 --> 01:56:45,598
than me process of doing something

3315
01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,840
it's not like a model it's not a virtual

3316
01:56:45,599 --> 01:56:51,039
signal or anything it just makes me

3317
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:53,119
happy that i fight for something bigger

3318
01:56:51,039 --> 01:56:54,800
like that me right so how boring is it

3319
01:56:53,118 --> 01:56:56,000
every day you get up like oh my god i'm

3320
01:56:54,800 --> 01:56:58,159
gonna buy myself

3321
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:00,158
this so i'm gonna get this for myself

3322
01:56:58,158 --> 01:57:03,039
it's so boring isn't it

3323
01:57:00,158 --> 01:57:04,079
so in a way i think that's what it is i

3324
01:57:03,039 --> 01:57:06,560
i'm grateful

3325
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:08,319
that i'm in a state i don't have to fly

3326
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:10,639
for myself anymore

3327
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:12,158
but many people have to do that and

3328
01:57:10,639 --> 01:57:14,159
that's sometimes more than enough they

3329
01:57:12,158 --> 01:57:14,799
have to do and i salute them they are

3330
01:57:14,158 --> 01:57:17,598
doing

3331
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,239
fighting saving themselves every day but

3332
01:57:17,599 --> 01:57:20,400
now i'm

3333
01:57:18,238 --> 01:57:22,319
i'm not there i'm very blessed that's

3334
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:24,319
why i'm very grateful

3335
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:26,799
so fighting for something much bigger

3336
01:57:24,319 --> 01:57:30,079
than you but do you still believe

3337
01:57:26,800 --> 01:57:34,239
that you can change the world that you

3338
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:37,840
can be a thing that

3339
01:57:34,238 --> 01:57:39,678
at least in part helps north korea or

3340
01:57:37,840 --> 01:57:41,599
even broader helps alleviate

3341
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:43,520
some suffering in the world so that's

3342
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:43,840
the thing uh i was reading this book

3343
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:47,440
food

3344
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:49,520
by randomness right yeah

3345
01:57:47,439 --> 01:57:51,759
i was like they're up here like oh my

3346
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:53,199
god you're so courageous you're amazing

3347
01:57:51,760 --> 01:57:54,719
i was like you know i'm not i'm horrible

3348
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:56,399
right i know myself you don't want to

3349
01:57:54,719 --> 01:57:58,319
tell me that

3350
01:57:56,399 --> 01:58:00,079
it's random why i end up here like why

3351
01:57:58,319 --> 01:58:01,118
did i pick up english so quickly why do

3352
01:58:00,079 --> 01:58:04,000
i love books right

3353
01:58:01,118 --> 01:58:04,880
i don't know why yeah it's random don't

3354
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:07,920
ask why

3355
01:58:04,880 --> 01:58:08,800
just enjoy it yes it's random i think i

3356
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:13,118
don't know how

3357
01:58:08,800 --> 01:58:15,119
the history will remember me i think

3358
01:58:13,118 --> 01:58:16,880
only thing i have to at this point to

3359
01:58:15,118 --> 01:58:18,559
make sure is that the people

3360
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:20,000
after constructing a lot of security

3361
01:58:18,560 --> 01:58:22,560
teams like now north korea

3362
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:24,238
became less smarter like you said they

3363
01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:25,360
may be more disguised as a like a

3364
01:58:24,238 --> 01:58:27,919
suicide

3365
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:29,519
and a car accident yeah so when i die

3366
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:33,279
they don't even know i got killed

3367
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:35,520
yeah i think that's a higher chance so

3368
01:58:33,279 --> 01:58:37,118
i think that's the thing like people are

3369
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:39,520
suffering take it or not it's

3370
01:58:37,118 --> 01:58:41,118
your choice and at least it's my

3371
01:58:39,520 --> 01:58:42,239
responsibility for them to know what's

3372
01:58:41,118 --> 01:58:43,920
going on

3373
01:58:42,238 --> 01:58:45,519
i think if you did not know and didn't

3374
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:46,399
do anything you are not even guilty of a

3375
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:48,719
thing

3376
01:58:46,399 --> 01:58:50,079
but once you know then you are not doing

3377
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:52,960
it then you

3378
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:54,158
something is like not right so that's

3379
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:57,920
what i'm doing like

3380
01:58:54,158 --> 01:59:00,000
i want the people to know and then

3381
01:58:57,920 --> 01:59:02,319
what they are gonna do is not my my

3382
01:59:00,000 --> 01:59:05,279
problem afterwards right

3383
01:59:02,319 --> 01:59:06,559
so my role is very small in that regards

3384
01:59:05,279 --> 01:59:09,840
and

3385
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:12,000
i just hope that would

3386
01:59:09,840 --> 01:59:14,480
humanize north koreans for the first

3387
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:16,479
time because we have been so dehumanized

3388
01:59:14,479 --> 01:59:19,198
right like we are like looking like

3389
01:59:16,479 --> 01:59:20,079
robots if you look at us marching and

3390
01:59:19,198 --> 01:59:22,799
cry like

3391
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:24,000
when dear later dies it almost seems

3392
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:26,239
like you don't even have the same

3393
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:30,639
emotions people cannot connect us

3394
01:59:26,238 --> 01:59:33,678
in the same level and i think that's

3395
01:59:30,639 --> 01:59:37,359
something is uh we that's something

3396
01:59:33,679 --> 01:59:39,760
media have done it to us and you're

3397
01:59:37,359 --> 01:59:42,799
you're shining a small light on this

3398
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:45,199
dark part of the world that i think

3399
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:46,239
and you make it you're so modest but i

3400
01:59:45,198 --> 01:59:49,839
think

3401
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:52,000
i think you will have that little light

3402
01:59:49,840 --> 01:59:54,239
uh just might be a big thing that

3403
01:59:52,000 --> 01:59:56,560
changes

3404
01:59:54,238 --> 01:59:58,559
that incredible amount of suffering

3405
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:59,360
that's happening on that part of the

3406
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:01,840
world

01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:02,719
