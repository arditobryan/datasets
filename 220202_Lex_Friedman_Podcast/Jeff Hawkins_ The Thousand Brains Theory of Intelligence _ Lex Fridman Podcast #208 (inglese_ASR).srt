1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:06,559
jeff hawkins a neuroscientist

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,278
seeking to understand the structure

4
00:00:06,559 --> 00:00:09,119
function

5
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:11,599
and origin of intelligence in the human

6
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,718
brain he previously wrote the seminal

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,759
book on the subject

8
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:18,559
titled on intelligence and recently

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,160
a new book called a thousand brains

10
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:21,118
which presents a new theory of

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,000
intelligence

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,559
that richard dawkins for example has

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,800
been

14
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,118
raving about calling the book quote

15
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,000
brilliant and exhilarating

16
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,679
i can't read those two words and not

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,799
think of him saying it in his british

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,759
accent

19
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:39,119
quick mention of our sponsors codecademy

20
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,159
bio optimizers

21
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,919
expressvpn a-sleep and blinkist check

22
00:00:42,159 --> 00:00:45,199
them out in the description to support

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,840
this podcast

24
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,520
as a side note let me say that one small

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,360
but powerful idea that jeff hawkins

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,359
mentions in his new book

27
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:54,558
is that if human civilization were to

28
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:57,519
destroy itself

29
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:58,000
all of knowledge all our creations will

30
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,640
go with

31
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,480
us he proposes that we should think

32
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,879
about how to save that knowledge

33
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,399
in a way that long outlives us whether

34
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,760
that's on earth

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,159
in orbit around earth or in deep space

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,920
and then to send messages that advertise

37
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,960
this backup of human knowledge

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,439
to other intelligent alien civilizations

39
00:01:16,959 --> 00:01:20,399
the main message of this advertisement

40
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:24,239
is not

41
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,600
that we are here but that we were

42
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:30,158
once here this little difference

43
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,959
somehow was deeply humbling to me that

44
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,200
we may

45
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,000
with some non-zero likelihood destroy

46
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,240
ourselves and that an alien civilization

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,400
thousands or millions of years from now

48
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,640
may come across this knowledge store

49
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,520
and they would only with some low

50
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
probability

51
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:47,200
even notice it not to mention be able to

52
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,600
interpret it

53
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,200
and the deeper question here for me is

54
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,798
what information in all of human

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,759
knowledge is even essential

56
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,960
does wikipedia capture it or not at all

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,519
this thought experiment

58
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,559
forces me to wonder what are the things

59
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,158
we've accomplished

60
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,759
and are hoping to still accomplish that

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,799
will outlive us

62
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,680
is it things like complex buildings

63
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,800
bridges cars

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,000
rockets is it ideas like science physics

65
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,120
and mathematics

66
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,520
is it music and art is it

67
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,759
computers computational systems or even

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
artificial intelligence systems

69
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:23,280
i personally can't imagine that aliens

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,319
wouldn't already have

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:29,280
all of these things in fact much more

72
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:30,639
and much better to me the only unique

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,199
thing we may have

74
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,279
is consciousness itself and the actual

75
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,799
subjective experience of suffering

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,479
of happiness of hatred of love

77
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,080
if we can record these experiences in

78
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,039
the highest resolution directly from the

79
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,040
human brain

80
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,479
such that aliens will be able to replay

81
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,479
them that

82
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,518
is what we should store and send as a

83
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:52,079
message

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,840
not wikipedia but the extremes of

85
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,640
conscious experiences

86
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,840
the most important of which of course is

87
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,000
love

88
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,519
this is the lex friedman podcast and

89
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,680
here is my conversation

90
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,840
with jeff hawkins we previously

91
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,760
talked over two years ago do you think

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,400
there's still neurons in your brain

93
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:13,439
that uh remember that conversation that

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,200
uh remember me

95
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:16,800
and got excited like there's a lex

96
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,238
neuron in your brain that just like

97
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,159
finally has a purpose

98
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,519
i do remember our conversation or i have

99
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,919
some memories of it

100
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,280
and i formed additional memories of you

101
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,839
in the meantime

102
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,439
um i wouldn't say there's a neuron or a

103
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,239
neurons in my brain that know you

104
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:33,120
there are synapses in my brain that have

105
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,680
formed

106
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,080
that reflect my knowledge of you and the

107
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,840
model i have of you in the world and

108
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,280
whether the exact same synapses were

109
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,640
formed two years ago it's hard to say

110
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,919
because these things come and go all the

111
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,518
time but

112
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,280
we know from one thing to know about

113
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
brains is that when you think of things

114
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,759
you often erase the memory and rewrite

115
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,359
it again so

116
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,079
yes but i have a memory of you and i

117
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,439
have that's instantiated in synapses

118
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,239
there's a simpler way to think about it

119
00:03:55,438 --> 00:04:00,318
like so you have we have a model

120
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,400
of the world in your head and that model

121
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,318
is continually being updated

122
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,080
i updated this morning you offered me

123
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,199
this water you said it was from the

124
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,920
refrigerator

125
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,759
i remember these things and so we and so

126
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,598
the model includes where we live the

127
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:15,359
places we know the words the

128
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,439
objects in the world it's a monstrous

129
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,359
model and it's constantly being updated

130
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,199
and people are just part of that model

131
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,079
so we're animals or other physical

132
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,919
objects

133
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,759
so our events we've done so um

134
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,758
it's there's no special in my mind

135
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,639
special place for the memories of humans

136
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,199
i mean

137
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,478
obviously i know you know i know a lot

138
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,160
about my wife

139
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:40,639
um but and friends uh and so on but

140
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,040
it's not like a special place for humans

141
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,960
over here but we model everything and we

142
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,160
model other people's behaviors too so if

143
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,680
i said you're a

144
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,520
copy of your mind in my mind it's just

145
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,400
because i know how humans

146
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:54,639
i've learned how humans behave and um

147
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:57,519
and i've learned some things about you

148
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,199
and that's part of my world model well i

149
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:01,120
just also mean

150
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,319
the collective intelligence of the human

151
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,680
species

152
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,918
i wonder if there's something

153
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,240
fundamental to the brain that enables

154
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:12,159
that so modeling other humans with their

155
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,439
ideas

156
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,199
you're actually jumping into a lot of

157
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:16,719
big topics like collective intelligence

158
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,000
is a separate topic that a lot of people

159
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,560
like to talk about we can talk about

160
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,079
that

161
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,759
uh but um and so that's interesting like

162
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,918
you know we're not just individuals we

163
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,319
live in society and so on

164
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:29,758
but from our research point of view and

165
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:31,680
so again let's just talk

166
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,680
we study the neocortex it's a sheet of

167
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,400
neural tissue it's about 75

168
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,600
of your brain it runs on this very

169
00:05:36,399 --> 00:05:40,959
repetitive algorithm

170
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,600
it's a very repetitive circuit and so

171
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,120
you can apply that algorithm to lots of

172
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
different problems but it's all

173
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,759
underneath it's the same thing we're

174
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,840
just building this model

175
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,840
so from our point of view we wouldn't

176
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:53,038
look for these special circuit someplace

177
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:53,839
buried in your brain that might be

178
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:55,519
related to

179
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,439
other you know understanding of the

180
00:05:55,519 --> 00:05:58,639
humans it's more like

181
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,160
you know how do we build a model of

182
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,519
anything how do we understand anything

183
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,800
in the world and humans are just

184
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:07,279
another part of the things we understand

185
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,240
so there's nothing uh there's nothing to

186
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:09,758
the brain that

187
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,600
knows the emergent phenomena of

188
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
collecting the intelligence well i

189
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,400
certainly know about that i've heard the

190
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:15,758
terms i've read

191
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:17,758
no but that's right right well okay

192
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,120
right as an idea well i think we have

193
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,720
language which is is

194
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,120
sort of built into our brains and that's

195
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,600
a key part of collective intelligence so

196
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
there are some you know prior

197
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,639
assumptions about the world we're going

198
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,038
to live in when we're born we're not

199
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,319
just

200
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,279
a blank slate um and so you know did we

201
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,520
evolve

202
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:36,478
to take advantage of those situations

203
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,758
yes but again

204
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:39,120
we study only part of the brain the

205
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,160
neocortex there's other parts of the

206
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,879
brain are very much

207
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,479
involved in societal interactions and

208
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,839
human emotions and

209
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,120
um and how we interact and even societal

210
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,598
um

211
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,038
issues about you know how we are how we

212
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,319
interact with other people when we

213
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,399
support them when we're greedy and

214
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,280
things like that i mean certainly the

215
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,038
brain

216
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,879
is a great place where to study

217
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,800
intelligence i wonder if it's the

218
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,598
fundamental

219
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,919
uh atom of intelligence well i would say

220
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:09,598
it's

221
00:07:07,918 --> 00:07:11,519
it's it's absolutely an essential

222
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:13,519
component even if you believe in

223
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,279
collective intelligence as

224
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:16,639
um hey that's where it's all happening

225
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:17,839
that's what we need to study which i

226
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,960
don't believe that by the way i think

227
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,159
it's really important but i don't think

228
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,279
that is the thing

229
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,439
um but even if you do believe that then

230
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:26,879
you have to understand how the brain

231
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,038
works in doing that

232
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,000
um it's you know it's more like we are

233
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:31,519
intelligent and

234
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,759
we are intelligent individuals and

235
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:35,120
together we are much more magnified our

236
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,560
intelligence we can do things that we

237
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,079
couldn't do individually

238
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,598
but even as individuals we're pretty

239
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,199
damn smart and

240
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:42,959
we can model things and understand the

241
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,800
world and interact with it

242
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,318
so um to me if you're going to start

243
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,400
some place you need to start

244
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,080
with the brain then you could say well

245
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:52,638
how do brains interact with each other

246
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:53,439
and what is the nature of language and

247
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,960
how do we

248
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,240
share models that i've learned something

249
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,560
about the world how do i share it with

250
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,319
you which is really what you know

251
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,160
sort of communal intelligence is i know

252
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,520
something you know something

253
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,120
we've had different experiences in the

254
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,639
world i've learned something about

255
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,680
brains maybe i can impart that to you

256
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,360
you've learned something about

257
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,680
you know whatever physics and you can

258
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,319
part that to me

259
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,840
but it also comes down to even just the

260
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,199
epistemological question of

261
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:19,119
well what is knowledge and how do you

262
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:21,038
represent it in the brain right

263
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,280
and it's not that's where it's going to

264
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,918
reside right or in our writings

265
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,279
it's obvious that human collaboration

266
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:30,079
human interaction

267
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,279
is how we build societies right but some

268
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:34,559
of the things you

269
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:36,799
talk about and work on

270
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,759
some of those elements of what makes up

271
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,559
an intelligent

272
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:41,519
entity is there with a single person oh

273
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,518
absolutely i mean

274
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,440
it'd be we can't deny that the brain is

275
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,039
the core element here in

276
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,200
in uh at least i can't i think it's

277
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,879
obvious the brain is the core element in

278
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,640
all theories of intelligence

279
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,120
uh it's where knowledge is represented

280
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,838
it's where knowledge is created

281
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
we interact we share we build upon each

282
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,880
other's work

283
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,480
but uh without a brain you'd have

284
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,919
nothing you know there would be no

285
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,120
intelligence without brains

286
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:08,879
and so um so that's where we start

287
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,639
i got into this field because i just was

288
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:12,240
curious as to who i am

289
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,679
you know how you know how do i think

290
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,200
what's going on in my head when i'm

291
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,278
what i'm thinking what does it mean to

292
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,480
know something you know i can ask what

293
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,559
it means for me to know something

294
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,800
independent of how i learned it from

295
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,399
you or from someone else or from society

296
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,919
so what does it mean for me to know that

297
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,120
i have a model of you in my head what

298
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:28,479
does it mean to know i know what this

299
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,759
microphone does and how it works

300
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,200
physically even though i can't see it

301
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,600
right now

302
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,040
how do i know that what does it mean how

303
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,320
the neurons do that at the

304
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:38,399
fundamental level of neurons and

305
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,120
synapses and so on those are

306
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,080
really fascinating questions and uh i'm

307
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,159
happy to

308
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,399
be just happy to understand those if i

309
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,399
could

310
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,200
so in your um in your new book

311
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:55,679
you talk about our brain our mind as

312
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,519
being made up of many brains

313
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:59,679
uh so the book is called the thousand

314
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,200
brains a thousand brain theory of

315
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,399
intelligence what is the key idea of

316
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,680
this book

317
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,399
uh the book has three sections

318
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:09,919
and it has sort of maybe three big ideas

319
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,360
so the first section is all about what

320
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,120
we've learned about the neurocortex and

321
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,639
that's the thousand brains theory

322
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,000
just did we complete the picture the

323
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:17,039
second section is all about ai and the

324
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,120
third section is about the future of

325
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,240
humanity

326
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,519
so the thousand brains theory

327
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,799
the the big idea there if i had to

328
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,120
summarize into one big idea

329
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,719
is that we think of the the brain the

330
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,440
neocortex is learning this model of the

331
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,600
world

332
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,440
but what we learned is actually there's

333
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,079
tens of thousands of independent

334
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,760
modeling systems going on and so each

335
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:42,639
what we call a column in the cortex is

336
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:44,559
about 150

337
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:46,319
000 of them is a complete modeling

338
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,838
system so

339
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,760
it's a collective intelligence in your

340
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,720
head in some sense so the thousand

341
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,720
brains theory says

342
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,399
well where do i have knowledge about you

343
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,879
know this coffee cup where is the model

344
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,120
of this

345
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,559
cell phone it's not in one place it's in

346
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,000
thousands of separate models that are

347
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,838
complementary and they communicate

348
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,839
with each other through voting so this

349
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,959
idea that we have we feel like we're one

350
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,320
person

351
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,319
you know that's our experience we can

352
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,160
explain that but reality there's

353
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,680
lots of these like almost like little

354
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:13,679
brands like but they're

355
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,838
they're sophisticated modeling systems

356
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:18,239
about 150 000 of them in each of

357
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,760
the human brain and that's a totally

358
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,839
different way of thinking about

359
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,519
how the neural cortex is structured than

360
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,040
we or anyone else thought of even just

361
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,600
five years ago

362
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,559
so you mentioned you started this

363
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,399
journey

364
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,838
and just looking in the mirror trying to

365
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:35,039
understand who you are

366
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,839
so if you have many brains who are you

367
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,599
then

368
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,200
so it's interesting we have a singular

369
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,759
perception right you know we think oh

370
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,519
i'm just

371
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:42,720
here i'm looking at you but it's it's

372
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,839
composed of all these things like

373
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,920
there's sounds and there's

374
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,120
and there's uh this vision and there's

375
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,399
touch and

376
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,078
all kinds of inputs yeah we have the

377
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:51,600
singular perception and what the

378
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:52,958
thousand brain theory says we have these

379
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,560
models that are visual models we have a

380
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:56,159
lot of models of auditory models models

381
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:59,439
of toxin models and so on

382
00:11:56,159 --> 00:12:01,679
but they vote and so um they send in the

383
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,200
cortex you can think about these columns

384
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,399
as that like little grains of

385
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,639
rice 150 000 stacked next to each other

386
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,600
and each one is its own little modeling

387
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,720
system

388
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,639
but they have these long-range

389
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
connections that go between them

390
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,320
and we call those voting connections or

391
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,838
voting neurons

392
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:21,519
um and so the different columns

393
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,959
try to reach the consensus like what am

394
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,480
i looking at okay you know

395
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,159
each one has some ambiguity but they

396
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,920
come to a consensus oh there's a water

397
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:30,639
bottle i'm looking at

398
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:32,000
um we are only consciously able to

399
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,440
perceive the voting

400
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,360
we're not able to perceive anything that

401
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,240
goes on under the hood

402
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,879
so the voting is what we're we're aware

403
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,159
of

404
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,838
the results of the vote yeah the

405
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,480
velocity well it's it's you can imagine

406
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,600
it this way

407
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,278
we were just talking about eye movements

408
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,720
a moment ago so as i'm looking at

409
00:12:45,278 --> 00:12:47,919
something my eyes are moving about three

410
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,240
times a second

411
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:51,838
and with each movement a completely new

412
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,360
input is coming into the brain it's not

413
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,480
repetitive it's not shifting it around

414
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,399
it's completely new

415
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,320
i'm totally unaware of it i can't

416
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,519
perceive it but yet if i looked at the

417
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,959
neurons in your brain they're going on

418
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,200
and off i don't know

419
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:04,399
but the voting neurons are not the

420
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,600
voting neurons are saying you know

421
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,720
we all agree even though i'm looking at

422
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,839
different parts of this is a water

423
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,160
bottle right now

424
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,040
and that's not changing and it's in some

425
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:13,519
position and

426
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,958
and pose relative to me so i have this

427
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,320
perception of the water bottle about two

428
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,119
feet away from me at a certain pose to

429
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,278
me

430
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,799
um that is not changing that's the only

431
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:22,000
part i'm aware of i can't be aware of

432
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,599
the fact that the inputs

433
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,039
from the eyes are moving and changing

434
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,920
and all this others happening

435
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:29,599
so these long range connections are the

436
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:32,639
part we can be conscious of

437
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,720
the individual activity in each column

438
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,560
is doesn't go anywhere else it doesn't

439
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,320
get shared anywhere else it doesn't

440
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,799
there's no way to extract it

441
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,399
and talk about it or extract it and even

442
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:45,599
remember it to say oh

443
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,879
yes i can recall that um so but these

444
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,800
long-range connections are the things

445
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,480
that are accessible to language

446
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,559
and to our you know it's like the

447
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,800
hippocampus or our memories you know

448
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,638
our short-term memory systems and so on

449
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,000
so we're not aware of

450
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,600
95 or maybe it's even 98 of what's going

451
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,839
on in your brain

452
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,519
we're only aware of this sort of stable

453
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,920
somewhat stable

454
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,000
voting outcome of all these things that

455
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,078
are going on underneath the hood

456
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,839
so what would you say is the basic

457
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,638
element in the thousand

458
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,839
brains theory of intelligence of

459
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,079
intelligence

460
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,360
like what's the atom of intelligence

461
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:23,359
when you think about it

462
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,480
is it the individual brains and then

463
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
what is a brain

464
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,839
well let's let's can we just talk about

465
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,278
what intelligence is first

466
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,120
and then and then we can talk about the

467
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,759
elements are so in my

468
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,320
in my book intelligence is the ability

469
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,120
to learn

470
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:39,120
a model of the world so to build

471
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,039
internal to your head

472
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,480
a model that represents the structure of

473
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,159
everything you know

474
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,680
to know what this is a table and that's

475
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:46,719
a coffee cup and this is a gooseneck

476
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:48,399
lamp and all this

477
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,920
to know these things i have to have a

478
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,278
model in my head i just don't look at

479
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,519
them and go what is that

480
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:55,039
i already have internal representations

481
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,639
of these things in my head

482
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,319
and i had to learn them i wasn't born of

483
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,839
any of that knowledge

484
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,440
you were you know we have some lights in

485
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,959
the room here i you know that's not part

486
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,320
of my evolutionary heritage right it's

487
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,799
not in my genes

488
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,240
so um we have this incredible model and

489
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,838
the model includes not only what things

490
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,278
look like and feel like but where they

491
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,079
are relative to each other and how they

492
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:13,600
behave

493
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,198
i've never picked up this water bottle

494
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,560
before but i know that if i took my hand

495
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:18,000
on that blue thing and i turn it it'll

496
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,919
probably make a funny little sound as

497
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,440
the little plastic things detach

498
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,958
and then it'll rotate and it'll look a

499
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,160
certain way it'll come off how do i know

500
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,278
that right because i have this model in

501
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,439
my head

502
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:29,039
so the essence of intelligence as our

503
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,120
ability to learn a model and the more

504
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,838
sophisticated our model is

505
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,278
the smarter we are not that there is a

506
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,639
single intelligence because

507
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:37,600
you can know about you know a lot about

508
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,959
things that i don't know and i know

509
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,720
about things you don't know

510
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,159
and we can both be very smart but we

511
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:43,600
both learn the model of the world

512
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:45,519
through interacting with it

513
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,879
so that is the essence of intelligence

514
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,560
then we can ask ourselves what are the

515
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,078
mechanisms in the brain

516
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,679
that allow us to do that and what are

517
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:53,039
the mechanisms of learning not just the

518
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:54,799
neural mechanisms what is the general

519
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:56,399
process but how we learn a model

520
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,639
so that was a big insight for us it's

521
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,799
like what are the what is the actual

522
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,680
things that how do you learn this stuff

523
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,559
it turns out you have to learn it

524
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,799
through movement

525
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:06,159
um you can't learn it just by that's how

526
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,719
we learn we learn through movement we

527
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,639
learn

528
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,000
um so you build up this model by

529
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,720
observing things and touching them and

530
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
moving them and

531
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,399
walking around the world and so on so

532
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,720
either you move or the thing moves

533
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,159
somehow yeah you obviously can learn

534
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,800
things just by reading a book something

535
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:20,480
like that but

536
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,078
think about if i were to say oh here's a

537
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,920
new house yeah i want you to learn

538
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,519
you know what do you do you have to walk

539
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,039
you have to walk from room to the room

540
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,560
you have to open the doors

541
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,319
look around see what's on the left

542
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,919
what's on the right as you do this

543
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,680
you're building a model in your head

544
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:34,879
it's just that's what you're doing you

545
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:36,000
can't just sit there and say i'm going

546
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:37,919
gonna grock the house

547
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,879
no you know or you could you don't even

548
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,240
want to sit there and read some

549
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:41,679
description of it right

550
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,720
yeah you literally physically

551
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:43,838
interactive the same with like a

552
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,600
smartphone if i want to

553
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,360
learn a new app i touch it and i move

554
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,360
things around i see what happens when i

555
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,879
when i do things with it so that's the

556
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,399
basic way we learn in the world and by

557
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,799
the way when you say model

558
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,399
you mean something that can be used for

559
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,958
prediction in the future

560
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,679
it's it's used for prediction and for

561
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:02,559
behavior

562
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:04,639
and planning right um and does a pretty

563
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:06,240
good job in doing so

564
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,919
yeah here's the way to think about the

565
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,880
model a lot of people get hung up on

566
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,000
this so

567
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,439
um you can imagine an architect making a

568
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
model of a house

569
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:17,120
right so there's a physical model that's

570
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,798
small and why do they do that

571
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,918
well we do that because you can imagine

572
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:20,959
what it would look like from different

573
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,000
angles you could say okay

574
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,078
look at them here look in there and you

575
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
can also say well how how far to get

576
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:26,480
from

577
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,679
from the garage to the to the swimming

578
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,120
pool or something like that right you

579
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,080
can imagine looking at this you can say

580
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:31,439
what would be the view from this

581
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:32,480
location so we built these physical

582
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,558
models to let you

583
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,919
imagine the future and imagine that

584
00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:37,759
behaviors

585
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,280
now we can take that same model and put

586
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,759
it in a computer so we now

587
00:17:39,279 --> 00:17:42,879
today they'll build models of houses and

588
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,319
a computer and they

589
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,679
and they do that using a set of um

590
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:49,200
we'll come back to this term in a moment

591
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,960
reference frames but eventually you

592
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,000
assign a reference frame for the house

593
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,679
and you assign different things for the

594
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,359
house in different locations

595
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,640
and then the computer can generate an

596
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:57,599
image and say okay this is what it looks

597
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,600
like in this direction

598
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,678
the brain is doing something remarkably

599
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:03,599
similar to this surprising

600
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,038
um it's using reference frames it's

601
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:06,000
building these it's similar to a model

602
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:07,440
in a computer

603
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,960
which has the same benefits of building

604
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,919
a physical model it allows me to say

605
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,079
what would this thing

606
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,759
look like if it was in this orientation

607
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:14,079
what would likely happen if i push this

608
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,079
button

609
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,759
i've never pushed this button before or

610
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:18,399
how would i accomplish something i want

611
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:21,359
to

612
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,000
i want to um convey a new idea i've

613
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,759
learned

614
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,359
how would i do that i can imagine in my

615
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,679
head well i could talk about it

616
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:28,879
i could write a book i could do some

617
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,280
podcasts

618
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,000
i could um you know maybe tell my

619
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:34,000
neighbor

620
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,519
you know and i can imagine the outcomes

621
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
of all these things before i do any of

622
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,359
them

623
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,359
that's what the model lets you do it

624
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:40,240
let's just plan the future and imagine

625
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,719
the

626
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,319
consequences of our actions prediction

627
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:46,798
you asked about prediction

628
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:49,678
prediction is not the goal of the model

629
00:18:46,798 --> 00:18:52,319
prediction is an inherent property of it

630
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,080
and it's how the model corrects itself

631
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:54,960
so prediction is fundamental to

632
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,599
intelligence

633
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,120
it's fundamental to building a model and

634
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,038
the model's intelligent

635
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:02,399
and let me go back and be very precise

636
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:03,759
about this prediction you can think of

637
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,200
prediction two ways one is like

638
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,279
hey what would happen if i did this

639
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,798
that's the type of prediction um

640
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,319
that's a key part of intelligence but

641
00:19:08,798 --> 00:19:12,319
using predictions like oh what's this

642
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,519
this is this water bottle gonna feel

643
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,200
like when i pick it up

644
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:17,359
you know and that doesn't seem very

645
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,798
intelligent but the way to think one way

646
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,678
to think about intelligence prediction

647
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:21,918
is

648
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,120
it's a way for us to learn where our

649
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,038
model is wrong

650
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,519
so if i picked up this water bottle and

651
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,960
it felt hot i'd be very surprised

652
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,960
or if i picked up was very light it

653
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,840
would be very i'd be surprised or

654
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,759
if i turned this top and it didn't i had

655
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,519
to turn the other way i'd be surprised

656
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,640
and so almost might have a prediction

657
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:39,200
like okay i'm gonna do it i'll drink

658
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,280
some water

659
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,798
i'm okay okay do this there it is i feel

660
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,399
opening right what if i had to turn it

661
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:44,879
the other way or what if it it split in

662
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,120
two

663
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,240
then i say oh my gosh i i misunderstood

664
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,879
this i didn't have the right model of

665
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,160
this thing

666
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,280
my attention would be drawn to i'll be

667
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
looking at it going well how the hell

668
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,480
did that happen

669
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,759
you know why did it open up that way and

670
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,120
i would update my model

671
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,160
by doing it just by looking at it and

672
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:59,839
playing around with that update and say

673
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,320
this is a new type of water bottle

674
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,959
but you so you're talking about sort of

675
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,119
uh

676
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,720
complicated things like a water bottle

677
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,918
but this also applies for just

678
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,400
basic vision just like seeing things

679
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,360
it's almost like a precondition of just

680
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:18,400
perceiving the world is predicting

681
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,038
it's just everything that you see is

682
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,759
first passed through your prediction

683
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,158
everything you

684
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:25,200
see and feel in fact this this is the

685
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,080
insight i had

686
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,960
uh back in the late 80s uh and excuse me

687
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,879
early 80s

688
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,240
and um another people reach the same

689
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,400
idea is that

690
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,679
every sensory input you get not just

691
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,320
vision but touch

692
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,360
and hearing you have an expectation

693
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:42,000
about it

694
00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:44,079
and um a prediction sometimes you can

695
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,519
pick very accurately sometimes you can't

696
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,038
i can't predict what next word is going

697
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,918
to come out of your mouth but as you

698
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,599
start talking about

699
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,960
better and better predictions and if you

700
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,558
talk about some topics i'd be very

701
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,079
surprised

702
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,000
so i have this sort of background

703
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:59,599
prediction that's going on all the time

704
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,798
for all my senses again the way i think

705
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:03,199
about that

706
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:04,960
is this is how we learn it's it's more

707
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,720
about how we learn

708
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,159
it's the test of our understanding our

709
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,079
predictions are our test

710
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,600
did is this really a water bottle if it

711
00:21:10,079 --> 00:21:12,960
is i shouldn't see

712
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,719
you know a little finger sticking out

713
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,679
the side and if i saw a little finger

714
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,240
stick and i was like what the hell is

715
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,440
going on

716
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,759
you know that's not normal um i mean

717
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,480
that's

718
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,679
fascinating that just let me linger on

719
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,798
this

720
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,038
for a second i it really honestly feels

721
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,519
that prediction is fundamental

722
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,079
to everything uh to the way our mind

723
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,440
operates

724
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:36,558
to intelligence so like it's just a

725
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,480
different way to see

726
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:39,839
intelligence which is like everything

727
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,159
starts at prediction

728
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:44,000
and prediction requires a model you

729
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,880
can't predict something unless you have

730
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,240
a model of it right but the action is

731
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,159
prediction it's like the

732
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,038
the thing the model does is prediction

733
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,440
and but it also yeah and you but

734
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,400
you can then extend it to things like uh

735
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,600
what would happen

736
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,880
if i took this today i went and did this

737
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,199
what would be like that

738
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,960
or how you can extend predictions like

739
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,360
oh i want to get a promotion at work

740
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,038
um what action should i take and you can

741
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,759
say if i did this i predict what might

742
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:11,279
happen if i

743
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:12,720
spoke to someone i predict what might

744
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,240
happen so it's not just low level

745
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,919
predictions yeah it's all prediction

746
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,679
it's all predictions like this

747
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,280
black box so you can ask basically any

748
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,280
question low level or highlight so we

749
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:24,000
start off with that observation it's all

750
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:25,359
it's like this non-stop prediction and i

751
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,440
write about this in the book about

752
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,479
and then we ask how do neurons actually

753
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,080
make predictions

754
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,839
physically like what does the neuron do

755
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:33,918
when it makes a prediction and

756
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,519
um what the neural tissue does when it

757
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,200
makes predictions and then we ask what

758
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,798
are the mechanisms by how we build a

759
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,519
model that allows you to make prediction

760
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:43,359
so we started with prediction as sort of

761
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:46,158
the fundamental

762
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:47,839
research agenda if in some sense like

763
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,960
and say well we understand how the brain

764
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:50,240
makes predictions

765
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,240
we'll understand how it builds these

766
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,679
models and how it learns and that's core

767
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,679
of intelligence so it was like it was

768
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:57,759
the key that got us in the door

769
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,360
to say that is our research agenda

770
00:22:57,759 --> 00:23:02,079
understand predictions

771
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:03,519
so in this whole process where does

772
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:06,879
intelligence

773
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:10,639
originate would you say so

774
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:12,960
it if we look at things that are

775
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,880
much less intelligent to humans and you

776
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,079
start to build up a human the process of

777
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,120
evolution

778
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:22,079
where is this magic thing that uh

779
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:23,519
has a prediction model or a model that's

780
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,119
able to predict

781
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:27,918
that starts to look a lot more like

782
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,158
intelligence is there a place where

783
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,919
richard dawkins wrote an introduction to

784
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,640
your uh to your book an excellent

785
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,120
introduction

786
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,759
i mean it puts a lot of things into

787
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:38,239
context

788
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:39,359
and it's funny just looking at parallels

789
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,000
for your book and

790
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,599
darwin's origin of species so darwin

791
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,200
wrote about the origin

792
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:49,439
of species so

793
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,200
what is the origin of intelligence well

794
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,480
we have a theory about it and it's just

795
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,278
that it's a theory

796
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,679
theory goes as follows as soon as living

797
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,759
things

798
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,600
started to move they're not just

799
00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:02,000
floating in sea they're not just

800
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,599
a plant you know grounded some place as

801
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,200
soon as they started the move

802
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:08,158
there was an advantage to moving

803
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,600
intelligently to moving in certain ways

804
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,320
and there's some very simple things you

805
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,158
can do you know bacteria or

806
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,319
single cell organisms can move towards a

807
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,200
source of gradient of food or something

808
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,038
like that

809
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,720
but an animal that might know where it

810
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,480
is and know where it's been and how to

811
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,798
get back to that place or an animal that

812
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,720
might

813
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:26,400
say oh there was a source of food

814
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,120
someplace how do i get to it or there

815
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,960
was a

816
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,479
danger how do i get to there was a mate

817
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,038
how do i get to them

818
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,880
um there was a big evolution advantage

819
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:35,519
to that so early on there was a pressure

820
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,600
to start

821
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,960
understanding your environment like

822
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,038
where am i

823
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,360
and where have i been and what happened

824
00:24:41,038 --> 00:24:46,480
in those different places

825
00:24:43,359 --> 00:24:49,599
so we still have this neural mechanism

826
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,278
in our brains um it's in in the in the

827
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,278
mammals it's in the

828
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,960
hippocampus and internal cortex these

829
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:58,159
are older parts of the brain

830
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:00,640
um and these are very well studied um

831
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,520
we build a map of the of our environment

832
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,799
so

833
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:04,798
these neurons in these parts of the

834
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:05,200
brain know where i am in this room and

835
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,679
where

836
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,400
the door was and things like that so a

837
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,559
lot of other

838
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,840
mammals have this all mammals have this

839
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:14,879
right and almost

840
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:16,639
any any animal that knows where it is

841
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,720
and get around must have some mapping

842
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,520
system must have some way of saying

843
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,038
i've learned a map of my environment i

844
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,359
have hummingbirds in my backyard and

845
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:25,119
they

846
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,959
and they go the same places all the time

847
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,319
they have to they must know where they

848
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,558
are they just know where they are when

849
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,839
they're

850
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:31,359
they're not just randomly flying around

851
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:32,639
they know they know particular flowers

852
00:25:31,359 --> 00:25:35,839
they come back to

853
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,159
so we all have this and it turns out

854
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:39,199
it's

855
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:41,039
very tricky to get neurons to do this to

856
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,360
build a map of an environment it's just

857
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,038
and so we now know there's this these

858
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:45,759
famous studies that's still very active

859
00:25:45,038 --> 00:25:47,440
about

860
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,798
place cells and grid cells and these

861
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,679
other types of cells in the older parts

862
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:51,440
of the brain

863
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,360
and how they build these maps of the

864
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,798
world it's really clever it's obviously

865
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:56,319
been under a lot of evolutionary

866
00:25:54,798 --> 00:25:57,759
pressure over a long period of time to

867
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,158
get good at this

868
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,679
so animals not know where they are what

869
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,120
we think has happened

870
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,440
uh and there's a lot of evidence to

871
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:06,719
digest this is that that mechanism we

872
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,000
learn to map

873
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:13,759
like a space is

874
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:17,839
was repackaged the same type of neurons

875
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:20,720
was repackaged into a more compact form

876
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:21,199
and that became the cortical column and

877
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,038
it was

878
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,798
it was in some sense genericized if

879
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,480
that's a word it was turned into a very

880
00:26:24,798 --> 00:26:29,038
specific thing about learning

881
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,919
maps of environments to learning maps of

882
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:31,759
anything

883
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,320
learning a model of anything not just

884
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:37,519
your space but coffee cups and so on

885
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:39,519
and it got sort of repackaged

886
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:41,278
into a more compact version a more

887
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:44,079
universal version

888
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:45,759
and then replicate it so the reason

889
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,278
we're so flexible is we have a very

890
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:50,079
generic version of this

891
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:51,119
mapping algorithm and we have 150 000

892
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:53,199
copies of it

893
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,479
sounds a lot like the progress of deep

894
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,080
learning

895
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:02,400
how so uh so take neural networks that

896
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:06,480
seem to work well for a specific task

897
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,720
compress them and multiply it

898
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,000
by a lot and then you just stack them on

899
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:12,400
top of it it's like the story of

900
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:15,679
transformers and uh yeah

901
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:17,759
but interesting networks they end up

902
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,440
you're replicating an element but you

903
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:20,000
still need the entire network to do

904
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,960
anything

905
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,558
right here what what's going on each

906
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,919
individual element is a complete

907
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,599
learning system

908
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,080
this is why i can take a human brain cut

909
00:27:27,599 --> 00:27:31,839
it in half and it still works

910
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,119
it's it's pretty amazing it's

911
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,480
fundamentally distributed it's

912
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,599
fundamentally distributed complete

913
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,319
modeling systems

914
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:38,959
so but that's that's our story we like

915
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,079
to tell

916
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,880
i i i would guess it's it's likely

917
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:46,319
largely right um but you know it's

918
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,600
there's a lot of evidence supporting

919
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,599
that story this evolutionary story

920
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,000
the thing which brought me to this idea

921
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:57,918
is that the human brain

922
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,240
got big very quickly so that that

923
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,679
led to the proposal a long time ago that

924
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,319
well there's this common element just

925
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,000
instead of

926
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,558
creating new things it just replicated

927
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,119
something we also are extremely flexible

928
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:12,558
we can learn things that we had no

929
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,119
history about right and so that tells it

930
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,119
that the

931
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,639
learning algorithm is very generic it's

932
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:18,879
very kind of universal

933
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:21,038
because it's it doesn't assume any prior

934
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,240
knowledge about what it's learning

935
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,679
and so you combine those things together

936
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,359
and you say okay well how did that come

937
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,640
about where did that universal algorithm

938
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:30,000
come from it had to come from something

939
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,679
that wasn't universal it came from

940
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,839
something that was more specific

941
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,600
and so anyway this led to our hypothesis

942
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,079
that you would find grid cells and place

943
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:40,079
cell equivalents in the neocortex

944
00:28:38,079 --> 00:28:41,599
and when we first published our first

945
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,439
papers on this theory

946
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:44,719
we didn't know of evidence for that it

947
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,600
turns out there was some but we didn't

948
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,000
know about it

949
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,519
uh and since then um so then we became

950
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,640
aware of evidence for grid cells in

951
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,398
parts of the neural cortex

952
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,320
and then now there's been new evidence

953
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,439
coming out there's some

954
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:57,759
interesting papers that came out just

955
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,640
january of this year so our one of our

956
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:00,879
predictions was

957
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,640
if this evolutionary hypothesis is

958
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,240
correct we would see grid cell place

959
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,880
cell equivalents cells that work like

960
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,480
them

961
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,000
through every column in the near cortex

962
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,720
and that's starting to be seen

963
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,000
what does it mean that uh why is it

964
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,759
important that they're present

965
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,960
because it tells us well we're asking

966
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:16,079
about the evolutionary origin of

967
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,480
intelligence right

968
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:19,678
so our theory is that these columns in

969
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,720
the cortex

970
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,038
are working on the same principles

971
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,038
they're modeling systems and it's hard

972
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:27,599
to imagine how neurons do this and so we

973
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:29,679
said

974
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,199
hey it's really hard to imagine how

975
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,519
neurons could learn these models of

976
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,880
things

977
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,879
we can talk about the details of that if

978
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,120
you want but

979
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,960
let's um but there's this other part of

980
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:42,239
the brain we know that learns models of

981
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:43,519
environments so could that mechanism to

982
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,759
learn to model this room be used to

983
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:47,918
learn a model the water bottle

984
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,440
is it the same mechanism so we said it's

985
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,720
much more likely the brain is using the

986
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:52,558
same mechanism

987
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,159
which case it would have these

988
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:55,599
equivalent cell types

989
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,360
so it's basically the whole theory is

990
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:59,359
built on the idea that

991
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:00,639
um these columns have reference frames

992
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:02,240
and they're learning these models

993
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,960
and these these grid cells create these

994
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,839
reference frames so it's it's basically

995
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:08,000
the major in some sense the major

996
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:10,639
predictive

997
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,240
part of this theory is that we will find

998
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,919
these equivalent mechanisms in

999
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,359
each column in the near cortex which

1000
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,480
tells us that's that

1001
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,558
that that's what they're doing they're

1002
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,599
learning these sensory motor models

1003
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:22,000
of the world so just we're pretty

1004
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:23,199
confident

1005
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,599
that would happen but now we're seeing

1006
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,600
the evidence so the evolutionary process

1007
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:29,199
nature does a lot of copy and paste and

1008
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,278
see what happens yeah

1009
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,759
yeah there's no direction to it but but

1010
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:35,919
um it just found out like hey if i

1011
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,599
took this these elements and and made

1012
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,880
more of them what happens and let's hook

1013
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:40,000
them up to the eyes and let's look up

1014
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,679
the ears and

1015
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,278
and um and that seems to work pretty

1016
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,600
well yeah like for us

1017
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:46,558
again just to take a quick step back to

1018
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,959
our

1019
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,240
conversation of collective intelligence

1020
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:53,919
do you sometimes

1021
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,880
see that as just another copy and paste

1022
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:58,000
aspect is copying pasting these uh

1023
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,720
brains and

1024
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,359
humans and making a lot of them and then

1025
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,399
creating

1026
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,918
uh social structures that then almost

1027
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:07,518
operates as a single brain

1028
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,159
uh i wouldn't have said it but you said

1029
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:12,798
it sounded pretty good

1030
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:14,080
so to you the brain is fundamental is uh

1031
00:31:12,798 --> 00:31:16,960
is like uh

1032
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,398
is its own thing right i mean our goal

1033
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,038
is to understand how the neural cortex

1034
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,759
works

1035
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,038
we can argue how essential that is to

1036
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:24,398
understand a human brain because it's

1037
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:26,960
not the entire human brain

1038
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,479
you can argue how essential that is to

1039
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,600
understanding human intelligence

1040
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,759
you can argue how essential it is to um

1041
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:34,639
to uh you know a sort of communal

1042
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:37,759
intelligence

1043
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,440
um i i'm not i didn't our goal was to

1044
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,599
understand the neocortex yeah so what is

1045
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,000
the neural cortex and where does it fit

1046
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,719
in um the various aspects of what the

1047
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,880
brain does

1048
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,839
like how important is it to you well

1049
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,600
obviously

1050
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:51,119
again we i mentioned again in the

1051
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:54,079
beginning it's it's it's

1052
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,558
about 70 to 75 of the volume of a human

1053
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,319
brain

1054
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,240
so it's you know it dominates our brain

1055
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:59,119
in terms of size not in terms of number

1056
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,000
of neurons but

1057
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:02,398
in terms of size size isn't everything

1058
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,798
jeff

1059
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:05,599
i know but it's it's nothing it's

1060
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:07,759
nothing

1061
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,038
it's not that we know that all

1062
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,879
high-level vision

1063
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:12,640
hearing and touch happens in the air

1064
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,080
context we know that all language

1065
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,840
occurs and is understood in the

1066
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,359
neurocortex whether that's spoken

1067
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,678
language written language sign language

1068
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:19,359
with

1069
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,798
language of mathematics language of

1070
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:22,798
physics music

1071
00:32:20,798 --> 00:32:24,398
math you know we know that all

1072
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:25,440
high-level planning and thinking occurs

1073
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:27,119
in the new york cortex

1074
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,558
if i were to say you know what part of

1075
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:30,479
your brain designed a computer

1076
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:33,038
and understands programming and and

1077
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,880
creates music it's all the neural cortex

1078
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:38,798
so then that's kind of undeniable fact

1079
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,919
uh if but then there's other parts of

1080
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,558
our brain are important too

1081
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,919
right our emotional states uh our body

1082
00:32:42,558 --> 00:32:47,599
regulating our body

1083
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,159
um so the way i like to look at it is

1084
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,599
you know could you can you understand

1085
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,080
the neocortex about the rest of the

1086
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:53,678
brain

1087
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:55,759
and some people say you can't and i

1088
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,200
think absolutely you can

1089
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:58,798
it's not that they're not interacting

1090
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,159
but you can understand them can you

1091
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:01,918
understand the neocortex without

1092
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,278
understanding the emotions of fear yes

1093
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,360
you can you can understand how the

1094
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,440
system works it's just a modeling system

1095
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:09,119
i make the analogy in the book that it's

1096
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,679
it's like a map of the world

1097
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:12,719
and how that map is used depends on

1098
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,960
who's using it

1099
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,919
so how our map of our world in our

1100
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,319
neocortex

1101
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:20,080
how we how we manifest as a human

1102
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,759
depends on the rest of our brain what

1103
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:23,519
are our motivations you know what are my

1104
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:24,000
desires am i a nice guy or not a nice

1105
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,000
guy

1106
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,599
am i a cheater or a you know or not a

1107
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,159
cheater um

1108
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:31,519
uh you know how important different

1109
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,559
things are in my life

1110
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:36,240
so um so but the

1111
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,879
new projects can be understood on its

1112
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,640
own um and and i say that

1113
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,720
as a neuroscientist i know there's all

1114
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,159
these interactions and i want to

1115
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,000
say i don't know them and we don't think

1116
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,799
about them but from a layperson's point

1117
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,240
of view you can say

1118
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,839
it's a modeling system i don't tend to

1119
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,120
think too much about the communal aspect

1120
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:54,398
of intelligence which you brought a

1121
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:56,719
number of times already

1122
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:58,798
um so that's not really been my concern

1123
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,839
i just wonder if there's a continuum

1124
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:04,839
from the origin of the universe like

1125
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:06,000
this com pockets of complexities that

1126
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:08,799
form

1127
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
yeah living organisms i wonder if if

1128
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,079
we're just

1129
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,119
if you look at humans we feel like we're

1130
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,159
at the top

1131
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:18,639
but i wonder if there's like just where

1132
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,480
everybody probably every living type

1133
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,440
pocket of complexity

1134
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,000
is probably thinks they're the uh pardon

1135
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,358
the french

1136
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,119
they're the yeah they're they're

1137
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:29,759
they're at the top of the parent well

1138
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,200
if they're thinking um well then then

1139
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,839
what is thinking what the all right

1140
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:35,039
in this sense the whole point is in

1141
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:38,799
their

1142
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:41,119
sense of the world they their sense

1143
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,839
is that they're at the top of it i think

1144
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,760
what is it turtle

1145
00:34:41,838 --> 00:34:45,679
but you're you're you're bringing up you

1146
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,720
know the the problems of complexity and

1147
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,280
complexity theory

1148
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,638
are you know it's a huge interesting

1149
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,599
problem in science

1150
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,519
um and you know i think we've made

1151
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,879
surprisingly little progress in

1152
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,239
understanding complex systems

1153
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,920
right in general um and so you know the

1154
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,598
santa fe institute was founded to to

1155
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,880
study this and and even the scientists

1156
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,880
there will say it's really hard we

1157
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,200
haven't really been able to figure out

1158
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,960
exactly you know that science isn't

1159
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:12,559
really congealed yet we're still trying

1160
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,119
to figure out the basic elements of that

1161
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:15,920
science

1162
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,440
uh what you know where does complexity

1163
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,400
come from and what is it and how you

1164
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,800
define it whether it's

1165
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,000
dna creating bodies or phenotypes or if

1166
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,839
it's

1167
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,199
individuals creating societies or ants

1168
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:27,039
and you know

1169
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:29,118
markets and so on it's it's a very

1170
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:29,599
complex thing i'm not a complexity

1171
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,880
theorist

1172
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,400
person right um and i i think

1173
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,000
they ask well the brain itself is a

1174
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,160
complex system so

1175
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,599
can we understand that um i think we've

1176
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:40,559
made a lot of progress understanding how

1177
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,599
the brain works

1178
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:45,279
so but i haven't brought it out to like

1179
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,079
oh well where are we on the complexity

1180
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,960
spectrum

1181
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,079
you know it's like um that's a great

1182
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,880
question

1183
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,640
i'd prefer for that answer to be we're

1184
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:57,599
not special

1185
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,358
it seems like if we're honest most

1186
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,240
likely we're not special so if there is

1187
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,000
a spectrum

1188
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:03,679
we're probably not in some kind of

1189
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,838
significant place there's one thing we

1190
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:08,159
could say that we are special

1191
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,279
and and again only here on earth i'm not

1192
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,480
saying i'm bad

1193
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,240
is that if we think about knowledge

1194
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,760
what we know um we clearly

1195
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:21,039
human brains have um the only brains

1196
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,320
that have a certain types of knowledge

1197
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,079
we're the only brains on

1198
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,000
on this earth to understand uh what the

1199
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,519
earth is how old it is

1200
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,920
that the universe is a picture as a

1201
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:33,119
whole the only organisms understand dna

1202
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,000
and the origins of you know of species

1203
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,640
uh no other species on on this planet

1204
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,199
has that

1205
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:40,319
knowledge so if we think about i like to

1206
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:42,078
think about

1207
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,440
you know one of the endeavors of

1208
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,359
humanity is to

1209
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,519
understand the universe as much as we

1210
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:49,358
can um

1211
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,119
i think our species is further along in

1212
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:52,719
that undeniably

1213
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,480
um whether our theories are right or

1214
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:55,358
wrong we can debate but at least we have

1215
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,280
theories you know we

1216
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:58,799
we know that what the sun is and how

1217
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:01,200
it's fusion is and how

1218
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,920
what black holes are and you know we

1219
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:03,519
know

1220
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,119
general theory relativity and no other

1221
00:37:03,519 --> 00:37:07,920
animal has any of this knowledge

1222
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,519
so in that sense that we're special uh

1223
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,000
are we special in terms of

1224
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:15,039
the the hierarchy of complexity in in

1225
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,039
the universe probably not

1226
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:20,960
can we look at a neuron yeah you say

1227
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,960
that prediction

1228
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,960
happens in the neuron what does that

1229
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,920
mean so neuron traditionally seen as the

1230
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,400
basic element

1231
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,119
of the the brain so we i mentioned this

1232
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,760
earlier

1233
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:33,519
that prediction was our research agenda

1234
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,520
yeah we said okay

1235
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:37,838
um how does the brain make a prediction

1236
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,320
like i i'm about to grab this water

1237
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,759
bottle

1238
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,079
and my brain is predicting what i'm

1239
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,760
going to feel um on all my parts of my

1240
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:45,280
fingers if i felt something really odd

1241
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,560
on any part here i notice it

1242
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,800
so my brain is predicting what it's

1243
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:50,559
going to feel as i grab this thing

1244
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,720
so what is that how does that manifest

1245
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:55,358
itself in neural tissue right we got

1246
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:57,199
brains made of neurons and there's

1247
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:59,119
chemicals and there's neurons and

1248
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:02,159
there's spikes and the connect you know

1249
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,640
where where is the prediction going on

1250
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,239
and one argument could be that well when

1251
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,719
i'm predicting something

1252
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:10,399
um a neuron must be firing in advance

1253
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,519
it's like okay this neuron represents

1254
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,599
what you're going to feel and it's

1255
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:14,960
firing it's sending a spike

1256
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,119
and certainly that happens to some

1257
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,720
extent but our predictions are so

1258
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,000
ubiquitous

1259
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:21,838
that we're making so many of them which

1260
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,119
we're totally unaware of just the vast

1261
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:24,078
majority we have no idea that you're

1262
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:27,200
doing this

1263
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,480
um that it wasn't really

1264
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,000
we were trying to figure how could this

1265
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,838
be where where is these where are these

1266
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,199
happening

1267
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:34,239
right and i won't walk you through the

1268
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,159
whole story unless you

1269
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,679
insist upon it but we came to the

1270
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:40,480
realization

1271
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,960
that most of your predictions are

1272
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,519
occurring

1273
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,800
inside individual neurons especially

1274
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:46,400
these the most common are in the

1275
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,079
pyramidal cells

1276
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,519
and there are there's a property of

1277
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,039
neurons

1278
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:52,800
we everyone knows or most people know

1279
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:53,279
that a neuron is a cell and it has this

1280
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,200
spike

1281
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,320
called an action potential and it sends

1282
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:57,919
information

1283
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,440
but we now know that there's these

1284
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,519
spikes internal to the neuron

1285
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,679
they're called dendritic spikes they

1286
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:05,039
travel along the branches of the neuron

1287
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,639
and they don't leave the neuron they're

1288
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,559
just internal only

1289
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,400
there's far more dendritic spikes than

1290
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,799
there are action potentials

1291
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,760
far more they're happening all the time

1292
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,680
and

1293
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,280
what we came to understand that those

1294
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:18,639
dendritic spikes the ones that are

1295
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,599
occurring are actually a form of

1296
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:21,279
prediction

1297
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,039
they're telling the neuron the neuron is

1298
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,680
saying i expect

1299
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:26,880
that i might become active shortly and

1300
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:29,440
that internal

1301
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,960
so the internal spike is a way of saying

1302
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,480
you're going to you might be generating

1303
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,760
external spikes soon

1304
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,559
i predicted you're going to become

1305
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,800
active and and we we've we've

1306
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:39,920
we wrote a paper in 2016 which explained

1307
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,720
and how this

1308
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,039
manifests itself in neural tissue and

1309
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:47,279
how it is that this all works together

1310
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,639
but the vast ma we think it's there's a

1311
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:51,040
lot of evidence supporting it

1312
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,319
um so we that's where we think that most

1313
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:53,039
of these predictions are internal that's

1314
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,880
why you can't

1315
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:57,039
be per their internal neuron you can't

1316
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,800
perceive them

1317
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,719
from understanding the the prediction

1318
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,400
mechanism of a single neuron

1319
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:03,919
do you think there's deep insights to be

1320
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,559
gained about the prediction

1321
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,079
capabilities of the mini brains within

1322
00:40:06,559 --> 00:40:08,639
the bigger brain and the brain oh yeah

1323
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,160
yeah yeah

1324
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:12,239
so having a prediction side of the

1325
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:15,519
individual neuron is not that useful

1326
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:16,799
you know what so what um the way it

1327
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:20,400
manifests itself

1328
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,920
in neural tissue is that

1329
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,079
when a neuron a neuron emits these

1330
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,920
spikes or a very singular type event

1331
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,000
if a neuron is predicting that it's

1332
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:30,079
going to be active it makes it spike

1333
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,358
very a little bit sooner just a few

1334
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,318
milliseconds sooner than it would have

1335
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:33,519
otherwise it's like

1336
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:35,199
i give the analogy in the book there's

1337
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:35,920
like a sprinter on a on a starting

1338
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,598
blocks in

1339
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,440
a race and if someone says get ready set

1340
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,960
you get up and you're ready to go

1341
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,639
and then when your race starts you get a

1342
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,960
little bit earlier start so that it's

1343
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,400
that

1344
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,599
that ready set is like the prediction

1345
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,559
and the neuron's like ready to go

1346
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,240
quicker

1347
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,078
and what happens is when you have a

1348
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:54,000
whole bunch of neurons together

1349
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,359
and they're all getting these inputs the

1350
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,400
ones that are in the predictive state

1351
00:40:55,358 --> 00:40:58,400
the ones that are

1352
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,318
anticipating to become active if they do

1353
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,680
become active they they happen sooner

1354
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:03,119
they disable everything else and it

1355
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:04,239
leads to different representations in

1356
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,440
the brain so

1357
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,959
you have to it's not isolated just to

1358
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,599
the neuron the prediction occurs within

1359
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,159
the neuron

1360
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,760
but the network behavior changes so what

1361
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,440
happens under different predictions

1362
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,599
different inputs have different

1363
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,079
representations so how i

1364
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:21,760
what i predict um it's going to be

1365
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,440
different under different contexts

1366
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,640
you know what my input will be is

1367
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,679
different under different context so

1368
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:28,639
this is this is a

1369
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,559
key level theory how this works so the

1370
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:32,078
theory of the thousand brains

1371
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,719
if you were to count the number of

1372
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,079
brains how would you do it

1373
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,399
the thousand main theory says that

1374
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,119
basically every cortical column

1375
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,318
in the in your neurocortex is a complete

1376
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,400
modeling system

1377
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,079
and that when i ask where do i have a

1378
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,680
model of something like a coffee cup

1379
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:49,440
it's not in one of those models it's in

1380
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,879
thousands of those models there's

1381
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,639
thousands of models of coffee cups

1382
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,240
that's what the thousand brains there's

1383
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,000
a voting mechanism then there's a voting

1384
00:41:54,239 --> 00:41:57,118
mechanism which leads which

1385
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,239
is the thing you're which you're

1386
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,240
conscious of which leads to your

1387
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,118
singular perception

1388
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,879
um that's why you perceive something so

1389
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,400
that's the thousand brains theory

1390
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,200
the details how we got to that theory

1391
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,240
um are complicated it wasn't you just

1392
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,679
thought of it one day

1393
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:16,000
and one of those details is we had to

1394
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,199
ask how does a a model make predictions

1395
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,719
and we've talked about just these

1396
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:20,480
predictive neurons

1397
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:21,759
that's part of this theory it's like

1398
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,199
saying oh it's a detail but

1399
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,160
it was like a crack in the doors like

1400
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:25,358
how are we going to figure out how these

1401
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,279
neurons build do this

1402
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,199
you know what is going on here so we

1403
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,960
just looked at prediction as like

1404
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:32,399
well we know that's ubiquitous we know

1405
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,358
that every part of the cortex is making

1406
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,358
predictions

1407
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:36,960
therefore whatever the predictive system

1408
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,639
is it's going to be everywhere

1409
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,240
we know there's a gazillion predictions

1410
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,759
happening at once so let's see if we can

1411
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:44,159
start teasing apart

1412
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,359
you know ask questions about you know

1413
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,559
how could neurons be making these

1414
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:48,318
predictions and that

1415
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,599
sort of built up to now what we have the

1416
00:42:48,318 --> 00:42:51,119
thousand brains theory

1417
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,200
which is complex you know it's just some

1418
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,240
i can state it simply but we just didn't

1419
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,799
think of it

1420
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:58,000
we had to get there step by step very it

1421
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,359
took years

1422
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:04,559
uh to get there and where does uh

1423
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:07,358
reference frames fit in so yeah

1424
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:07,920
okay so again a reference frame i

1425
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,318
mentioned

1426
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,440
um earlier about the you know a model of

1427
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:12,480
a house and i said if you're going to

1428
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,159
build a model of a house

1429
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:15,440
in a computer they have a reference

1430
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,759
frame and you can then reference them

1431
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,000
like

1432
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,200
cartesian coordinates like x y and z

1433
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,800
axes

1434
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:22,239
so i can say oh i'm going to design a

1435
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,720
house i can say well the

1436
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,879
the front door is at this location xyz

1437
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:27,358
and the roof is at this location xyz and

1438
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:29,680
so on

1439
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,480
that's a type of reference frame so it

1440
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:32,239
turns out

1441
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,440
for you to make a prediction and then i

1442
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:34,799
walk you through the thought experiment

1443
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:36,159
in the book where i was

1444
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,839
predicting what my finger was going to

1445
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:39,440
feel when i touched the coffee cup

1446
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:41,599
it was a ceramic coffee cup but this one

1447
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,800
will do um

1448
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,000
and what i realized is that to make a

1449
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,119
prediction with my finger's going to

1450
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,239
feel like it's just going to feel

1451
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:49,680
different than this which would feel

1452
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,118
different if i touch the hole or the

1453
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,279
thing on the bottom

1454
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,119
make that prediction the cortex needs to

1455
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,160
know where the finger is the tip of the

1456
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,039
finger

1457
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:00,719
relative to the coffee cup and exactly

1458
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:02,000
relative to the coffee cup

1459
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:03,358
and to do that i have to have a

1460
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,400
reference frame for the coffee up it has

1461
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:06,159
to have a way of representing the

1462
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,160
location of my finger

1463
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:09,598
to the coffin up and then we realize of

1464
00:44:08,159 --> 00:44:11,039
course every part of your skin has to

1465
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,838
have a reference frame relative things

1466
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,000
to touch and then we

1467
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:15,519
did the same thing with vision but so

1468
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,199
the idea that a reference frame

1469
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:18,719
is necessary to make a prediction when

1470
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,078
you're touching something or when you're

1471
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:21,279
seeing something

1472
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,240
and you're moving your eyes you're

1473
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,200
moving your fingers it's just a

1474
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,759
requirement

1475
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:26,879
to know what to predict if i have a if i

1476
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,000
have a structure i'm going to make a

1477
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,440
prediction i have to

1478
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,119
i have to know where it is i'm looking

1479
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:33,519
or touching it

1480
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,519
so then we say well how do neurons make

1481
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:37,679
reference frames it's not obvious

1482
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:39,838
you know xyz coordinates don't exist in

1483
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:41,440
the brain it's just not the way it works

1484
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:42,719
so that's when we looked at the older

1485
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,318
part of the brain the hippocampus and

1486
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,879
the antorano cortex

1487
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:47,440
where we knew that in that part of the

1488
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,119
brain

1489
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:50,720
there's a reference frame for a room or

1490
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,079
reference name for environment remember

1491
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:54,318
i talked earlier about how you could

1492
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,519
know make a map of this room

1493
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:59,279
so we said oh um that they are

1494
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,039
implementing reference frames there so

1495
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,280
we knew that reference frames needed to

1496
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:06,318
exist in every cortical column

1497
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,359
and so that was a deductive thing we

1498
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:10,400
just deduced it

1499
00:45:07,358 --> 00:45:14,000
has to go so you take the old

1500
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,920
mammalian ability to know where you are

1501
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,519
in a particular space

1502
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,039
and you start applying that to higher

1503
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,400
and higher levels yeah you first you

1504
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:21,119
apply it to physical like where your

1505
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,880
finger is

1506
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,400
so here's what i think about it the old

1507
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,280
part of the brain says where's my body

1508
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,800
in this room

1509
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,400
yeah the new part of the brain says

1510
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,440
where's my finger

1511
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:31,920
relative to this this object yeah where

1512
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,800
is

1513
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,240
the a section of my retina relative to

1514
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,440
this object like where where is

1515
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:38,879
i'm looking at one little corner where

1516
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,000
is that relative to this patch of my

1517
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,480
retina yeah

1518
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,079
um and then we take the same thing and

1519
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,358
apply it to concepts

1520
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,480
mathematics physics you know humanity

1521
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:50,318
whatever you want to think eventually

1522
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:53,679
you're pondering your own mortality

1523
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:54,960
well whatever but the point is when we

1524
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:56,480
think about the world when we have

1525
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,599
knowledge about the world how is that

1526
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,039
knowledge organized

1527
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:01,039
lex where do you where is it in your

1528
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:01,759
head the answer is it's in reference

1529
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:04,400
frames

1530
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,520
so the way i learn the structure of this

1531
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,119
water bottle

1532
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,440
where the features are relative to each

1533
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,280
other when i think about history or

1534
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,440
democracy or mathematics

1535
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:14,800
the same basic underlying structures

1536
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,679
happening there's reference frames for

1537
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,039
where the knowledge

1538
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:18,159
that you're assigning things to so in

1539
00:46:17,039 --> 00:46:19,279
the book i go through examples like

1540
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,399
mathematics

1541
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,680
and language and politics but

1542
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,240
the evidence is very clear in the

1543
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,838
neuroscience the same mechanism that we

1544
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:28,799
use to model this coffee cup we're going

1545
00:46:27,838 --> 00:46:31,519
to use to model

1546
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,119
high level thoughts your your your

1547
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,239
demise of the humanity whatever you want

1548
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,760
to think about

1549
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,598
it's interesting to think about how

1550
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,079
different are the representations of

1551
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:41,359
those

1552
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,599
higher dimensional concepts

1553
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,279
higher level concepts how different the

1554
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,400
representation there is in terms of

1555
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,800
reference frames

1556
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,760
versus spatial but interesting thing

1557
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,599
it's it's

1558
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,760
it's a different application but it's

1559
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,039
the exact same mechanism

1560
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,359
but isn't there some aspect to uh

1561
00:46:57,039 --> 00:47:00,880
higher level concepts that they seem to

1562
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,559
be hierarchical

1563
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,318
like they just seem to integrate a lot

1564
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:07,679
of information into so

1565
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:09,199
is our physical objects so take this

1566
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,358
water bottle

1567
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:13,279
uh i'm not particular to this brand but

1568
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,759
this is a fiji water bottle

1569
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:17,119
and it has um a logo and i use this

1570
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,440
example in my book

1571
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:20,400
our company's coffee cup has a logo on

1572
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:23,519
it but

1573
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:25,280
this object is hierarchical it is

1574
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:27,039
it's got like a cylinder and a cap but

1575
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,720
then has this logo on it and the logo

1576
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:30,719
has a word the word has letters the

1577
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:33,039
letters of different features

1578
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:34,480
and so i don't have to remember i don't

1579
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:36,239
think about this so i said oh there's a

1580
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:37,358
fiji logo on this water bottle i don't

1581
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:39,279
have to go through and say

1582
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,279
oh what is the fiji logo it's the f and

1583
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,319
i and the j and i and there's a hibiscus

1584
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,000
flower and

1585
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,358
and uh oh it has the pest you know the

1586
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,559
stamen on it i don't have to do that i

1587
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:47,759
just incorporate all of that

1588
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,160
in some sort of hierarchical

1589
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:52,000
representation i say um

1590
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:53,279
you know put this logo on this water

1591
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,199
bottle yeah and

1592
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:56,480
and and then the logo has a word and the

1593
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,399
word has letters

1594
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,920
all hierarchical just all that stuff is

1595
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,760
big it's amazing that the brain

1596
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,760
instantly just does all that yeah the

1597
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,599
idea that there's there's water it's

1598
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:08,480
liquid and the idea that you can

1599
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:09,599
uh drink it when you're thirsty the idea

1600
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,920
that there's brands

1601
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,880
yeah and then there's like all of that

1602
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,519
information is

1603
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,000
instantly like built into the whole

1604
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:17,440
thing

1605
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,800
once you proceed so i wanted to get back

1606
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,519
to your point about hierarchical

1607
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:22,160
representation

1608
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,679
the world itself is hierarchical right

1609
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:25,118
and i can take this microphone in front

1610
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:26,399
of me i know inside there's going to be

1611
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,519
some electronics i know there's going to

1612
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,079
be some wires and i know there's going

1613
00:48:27,519 --> 00:48:30,480
to be a little

1614
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,720
diaphragm that moves back and forth i

1615
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,000
don't see that but i know it

1616
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,000
so everything in the world is

1617
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,599
hierarchical you just go into room it's

1618
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,039
composed of other components the kitchen

1619
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,640
has a refrigerator you know

1620
00:48:39,039 --> 00:48:42,400
the refrigerator has a door the door has

1621
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:43,199
a hinge the hinge has screws and pin

1622
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:45,920
yeah i mean

1623
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:48,078
so anyway the the the modeling system

1624
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:50,639
that exists in every cortical column

1625
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,519
learns the hierarchical structure of

1626
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:53,279
objects

1627
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,719
so it's a very sophisticated modeling

1628
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,240
system in this grain of rice it's hard

1629
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:57,759
to imagine but this grain of ice can do

1630
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:00,239
really sophisticated things it's got a

1631
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:04,079
hundred thousand neurons in it

1632
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:06,639
it's very sophisticated so that same

1633
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,559
mechanism that can model a water bottle

1634
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:09,440
or a coffee cup can model conceptual

1635
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:12,480
objects as well

1636
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,000
it's if that's the beauty of this

1637
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,599
discovery that this guy vernon mount

1638
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,559
castle made many many years ago which is

1639
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,240
that

1640
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:19,680
there's there's a single cortical

1641
00:49:18,239 --> 00:49:20,879
algorithm underlying everything we're

1642
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:23,838
doing

1643
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,440
so so common sense concepts and higher

1644
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:27,119
level concepts are all

1645
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,960
represented in the same way they're set

1646
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,640
in the same mechanisms yeah

1647
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,240
it's a little bit like computers right

1648
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:33,039
all computers are universal turing

1649
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,598
machines

1650
00:49:33,039 --> 00:49:36,480
even the little teeny one that's in my

1651
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,760
toaster

1652
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,599
and the big one that's you know running

1653
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,040
some cloud server or someplace

1654
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,240
um they're all running on the same

1655
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:42,960
principle they can apply different

1656
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:44,639
things

1657
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,079
so the brain is all built on the same

1658
00:49:44,639 --> 00:49:48,078
principle it's all about

1659
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,440
learning these models structured models

1660
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:52,079
using movement

1661
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,119
and reference frames and it can be

1662
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,559
applied to

1663
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,160
something as simple as a water bottle in

1664
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,079
a coffee cup and it can be just thinking

1665
00:49:56,159 --> 00:50:01,118
like what's the future of humanity and

1666
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,440
you know why do you have a hedgehog on

1667
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,519
your

1668
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,358
on your desk i don't know nobody knows

1669
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,358
i think it's hedgehog that's right it's

1670
00:50:07,358 --> 00:50:11,598
a hedgehog in the fog

1671
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:14,078
it's a russian reference does it give

1672
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:16,318
you any

1673
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,359
inclination or hope about how difficult

1674
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:20,000
it is to engineer

1675
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:20,880
common sense reasoning so how

1676
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,639
complicated this

1677
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,559
is this whole process so looking at the

1678
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:27,679
brain

1679
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:29,680
is this a marvel of engineering or is it

1680
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:32,239
pretty dumb stuff stacked on top of each

1681
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:35,598
other over and over

1682
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:37,919
can it be both can it be both right

1683
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,039
i don't know if it can be both because

1684
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,519
uh

1685
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,558
if it's an incredible engineering job

1686
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,679
that means it's

1687
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:48,079
v so evolution did a lot of work it

1688
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,358
uh yeah but then but then it just copied

1689
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:52,160
that

1690
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:53,598
right so as i said earlier the figuring

1691
00:50:52,159 --> 00:50:55,920
out how to model something

1692
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:57,440
like a space is really hard and

1693
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,440
evolution had to go through a lot of

1694
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,559
trick and these these these cells i was

1695
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:02,000
talking about these grid cells and place

1696
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,040
cells they're really complicated this is

1697
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,199
not simple stuff

1698
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:08,719
this neural tissue works on these really

1699
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:11,358
unexpected weird mechanisms um

1700
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:13,039
but it did it it figured it out but but

1701
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:13,598
now you can just make lots of copies of

1702
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,079
it

1703
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,318
but then finding yeah so it's a very

1704
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:21,359
interesting idea that's a lot of copies

1705
00:51:18,318 --> 00:51:24,239
of a basic mini brain

1706
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:25,679
but the question is how difficult it is

1707
00:51:24,239 --> 00:51:27,919
to find that mini brain that you can

1708
00:51:25,679 --> 00:51:31,118
copy and paste

1709
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:34,240
uh effectively okay today we

1710
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,880
know enough to build this i'm sitting

1711
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:36,558
here with

1712
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,920
you know i know the steps we have to go

1713
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:38,800
there's still some engineering problems

1714
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,079
to solve

1715
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,519
but we know enough and this is not like

1716
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:44,880
oh this is an interesting idea

1717
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:46,719
we have to go think about it for another

1718
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:48,160
few decades no we actually understand in

1719
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:51,838
pretty well details

1720
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:54,078
so not all the details but most of them

1721
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,358
so it's complicated but it is an

1722
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,519
engineering problem

1723
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,639
so in my company we are working on that

1724
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,838
we are basically

1725
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:02,879
a road map how we do this um it's not

1726
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:04,920
going to take decades

1727
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,240
it's better a few years um

1728
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,599
[Music]

1729
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:09,759
optimistically but i think that's

1730
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:11,280
possible um

1731
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,800
it's you know complex things if you

1732
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,559
understand them you can build them

1733
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,480
so in which domain do you think it's

1734
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,680
best to

1735
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,639
build them are we talking about robotics

1736
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:22,960
like

1737
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:24,318
uh entities that operate in the physical

1738
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,159
world that are able to interact with

1739
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:27,920
that world are we talking about entities

1740
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:30,719
that operate in the digital world

1741
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,039
are we talking about something more like

1742
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:33,199
uh

1743
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,639
more specific like is done in the uh

1744
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,480
machine learning community where you

1745
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:39,679
look at natural language

1746
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,400
or computer vision where do you think is

1747
00:52:39,679 --> 00:52:44,838
easiest it's the first it's the first

1748
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:48,400
two more than the third one i would say

1749
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:50,159
um again again let's just use computers

1750
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,079
as an analogy

1751
00:52:50,159 --> 00:52:53,199
um the pioneers of computing people like

1752
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,119
john van noyman and

1753
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:57,039
um turing they created this thing you

1754
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,200
know we now call the universal turing

1755
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:00,318
machine which is the computer right

1756
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:01,919
did they know how it was going to be

1757
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:02,880
applied where it was going to be used

1758
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,639
you know could they

1759
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,480
envision any of the future no they just

1760
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:09,598
said this is like a really interesting

1761
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:12,159
computational idea about algorithms

1762
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,599
and how you can implement them in in a

1763
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:16,078
machine

1764
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,680
and we're doing something similar to

1765
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,359
that today like we are

1766
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:21,199
we are building this sort of universal

1767
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:22,960
learning principle

1768
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:24,480
that can be applied to many many

1769
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,880
different things

1770
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:28,559
but the the robotics piece of that okay

1771
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,318
the interactive okay all right let's

1772
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,920
be specific you can think of this

1773
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,519
cortical column as this what we call a

1774
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,119
sensory motor learning system it has the

1775
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:37,599
idea that there's a sensor

1776
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:39,519
and then it's moving that sensor can be

1777
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,200
physical it could be like my finger

1778
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:43,440
and it's moving in the world it could

1779
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:46,960
like my eye and it's physically moving

1780
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:49,679
it can also be virtual so it could be

1781
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,679
um an example would be i could have a

1782
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:54,078
system that lives in the internet

1783
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:55,759
that that actually samples information

1784
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:56,318
on the internet and moves by following

1785
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,359
links

1786
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:01,759
that's that's a sensory motor system so

1787
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,199
something that echoes the the process of

1788
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,599
a finger moving along a

1789
00:54:03,199 --> 00:54:06,719
car but in a very very loose sense it's

1790
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,880
it's like

1791
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,239
again learning is inherently about the

1792
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:11,599
subbing the structure in the world and

1793
00:54:10,239 --> 00:54:12,879
discover the structure of the world you

1794
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,720
have to move through the world

1795
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,240
even if it's a virtual world even if

1796
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:18,239
it's a conceptual world

1797
00:54:16,239 --> 00:54:19,519
you have to move through it you don't it

1798
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:22,558
doesn't exist in one

1799
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,920
it has some structure to it so

1800
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:27,040
here's here's a couple of predictions

1801
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:29,280
that getting what you're talking about

1802
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,279
in humans the same algorithm is does

1803
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:32,000
robotics right it moves my arms my eyes

1804
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,200
my body

1805
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:37,280
right um and so

1806
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:38,399
in my in the future to me robotics and

1807
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,000
ai will merge

1808
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:42,000
they're not going to be separate fields

1809
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,760
because they're going to the the

1810
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,719
the algorithms to really controlling

1811
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,400
robots are going to be the same

1812
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:48,318
algorithms we have in our brand the

1813
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:49,760
brain at these sensory motor algorithms

1814
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,199
i today we're not there but i think

1815
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:55,200
that's going to happen

1816
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:57,118
and and then so but not all ai systems

1817
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:58,879
will have b robotics

1818
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:00,400
you can have systems that have very

1819
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,358
different types of embodiments some will

1820
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,280
have physical movements

1821
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:05,039
some will have non-physical movements

1822
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,880
it's a very generic

1823
00:55:05,039 --> 00:55:08,719
learning system again it's like

1824
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,039
computers the turing machine is it's

1825
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,078
like

1826
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:11,519
it doesn't say how it's supposed to be

1827
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,200
implemented it doesn't tell how big it

1828
00:55:11,519 --> 00:55:14,318
is doesn't tell you what you apply it to

1829
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,558
but it's an interesting it's a

1830
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,000
computational principle

1831
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:19,359
cortical column equivalent is a

1832
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,079
computational principle is about

1833
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:21,759
learning

1834
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:23,280
it's about how you learn and it can be

1835
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,559
applied to a gazillion things this is

1836
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,798
what i think this is

1837
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,798
i think this impact of ai is going to be

1838
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,960
as large if not larger than computing

1839
00:55:28,798 --> 00:55:33,280
has been in the last century by far

1840
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:34,480
because it's it's getting at a

1841
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:36,559
fundamental thing it's not a vision

1842
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:38,000
system or a learning system it's a

1843
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,839
it's not a vision system or a hearing

1844
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,280
system it is a learning system it's a

1845
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:42,159
fundamental principle how you learn the

1846
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,599
structure in the world

1847
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:45,920
how you can gain knowledge and be

1848
00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:47,519
intelligent and that's what the thousand

1849
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,720
brain says what's going on and we have a

1850
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,798
particular implementation in our head

1851
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,399
but doesn't have to be like that at all

1852
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:54,480
do you think there's going to be some

1853
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,519
kind of impact

1854
00:55:54,480 --> 00:56:00,559
okay let me ask it another way what do

1855
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:03,759
uh increasingly intelligent ai systems

1856
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:06,720
do with us humans in the following way

1857
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,200
like how hard is the human in the loop

1858
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:10,558
problem

1859
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:13,039
how hard is it to to interact

1860
00:56:10,559 --> 00:56:14,798
the finger on the coffee cup equivalent

1861
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,599
of having a conversation with a human

1862
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:18,400
being

1863
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:19,440
so how hard is it to fit into our little

1864
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,838
human world

1865
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,679
uh i don't i think it's a lot of

1866
00:56:21,838 --> 00:56:26,000
engineering problems i don't think it's

1867
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,279
a fundamental problem i could ask you

1868
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,440
the same question how hard is for

1869
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,720
computers to fit into a human world

1870
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,280
right that i mean that's essentially

1871
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:37,199
what i'm asking like how

1872
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,240
um much are we uh elitist are we as

1873
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:41,598
humans

1874
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:44,879
like we try to keep out uh systems

1875
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,720
i don't know i i sure i think i'm not

1876
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,240
sure that's the right question

1877
00:56:46,719 --> 00:56:50,399
let's let's look at computers as an

1878
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,078
analogy computers are million times

1879
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,358
faster than us they do things we can't

1880
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,039
understand most people have no idea

1881
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:57,358
what's going on when they use computers

1882
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,079
right how do we integrate them in our

1883
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:00,719
society

1884
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,920
um well they're that we don't think of

1885
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:04,639
them as their own entities

1886
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,240
they're not living things um we don't

1887
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:09,358
afford them rights

1888
00:57:06,239 --> 00:57:12,479
um we uh we rely on them

1889
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:13,279
our survival as a seven billion people

1890
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,318
or something like that

1891
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:18,319
is relying on computers now um don't you

1892
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:21,119
think that's a fundamental problem

1893
00:57:18,318 --> 00:57:22,400
that we see them as something we can't

1894
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:25,119
we don't give rights to

1895
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,280
so computers so yeah computers so uh

1896
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,798
robots computers intelligence systems it

1897
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:30,000
feels like for them to operate

1898
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:32,880
successfully

1899
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:33,760
they would need to have a lot of the

1900
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,480
elements

1901
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,839
that we would start having to think

1902
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,240
about like

1903
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:40,960
should this entity have rights i i don't

1904
00:57:40,239 --> 00:57:44,399
think so i

1905
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,838
i think it's tempting to think that way

1906
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,680
personally i don't think anyone hardly

1907
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:49,039
anyone thinks that for computers today

1908
00:57:47,679 --> 00:57:50,318
no one says oh this thing

1909
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:52,400
needs a right i shouldn't be able to

1910
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:53,119
turn it off or you know if i throw it in

1911
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:54,480
the trash can

1912
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,880
you know and hit it with a sledgehammer

1913
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,000
i might perform a criminal act no no one

1914
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:00,480
thinks that

1915
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:01,358
um and now we think about intelligent

1916
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,480
machines

1917
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:07,119
which is where you're going um

1918
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,240
and and all of a sudden like well now we

1919
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,079
can't do that

1920
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:11,039
i think the basic problem we have here

1921
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:12,559
is that people think intelligent

1922
00:58:11,039 --> 00:58:14,000
machines will be like us

1923
00:58:12,559 --> 00:58:16,319
they're going to have the same emotions

1924
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,519
as we do the same feelings as we do

1925
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:19,599
what if i can build an intelligent

1926
00:58:17,519 --> 00:58:21,119
machine that have absolutely could care

1927
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,079
less about whether it was on or off or

1928
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,440
destroyed or not

1929
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,440
it just doesn't care it's just like a

1930
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,480
map it's just a modeling system

1931
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:31,760
it has no desires to live nothing

1932
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:35,358
is it possible to create a system that

1933
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:36,799
can model the world deeply and not care

1934
00:58:35,358 --> 00:58:38,639
about whether it lives or dies

1935
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:41,280
absolutely no question about it

1936
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:42,719
to me that's not 100 percent obvious

1937
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,880
it's obvious to me so okay

1938
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:47,039
we can debate it if you want yeah where

1939
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,240
does your where does your desire to live

1940
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,759
come from

1941
00:58:48,239 --> 00:58:53,039
it's an old evolutionary design

1942
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,480
i mean we could argue does it really

1943
00:58:53,039 --> 00:58:58,639
matter if we live or not objectively no

1944
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,559
right we're all going to die eventually

1945
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:03,039
um

1946
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:05,119
but evolution makes us want to live

1947
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:06,880
evolution makes us want to fight to live

1948
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,200
evolutionists want to care and love one

1949
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,680
another and to care for our children

1950
00:59:09,199 --> 00:59:12,960
and our relatives and our family and and

1951
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:15,598
so on

1952
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,679
and those are all good things but they

1953
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:19,680
come about not because we're smart

1954
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,519
because we're animals that grew up you

1955
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,960
know the the hummingbird in my backyard

1956
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,519
cares about its offspring

1957
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,119
you know the every living thing in some

1958
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,759
sense cares about you know

1959
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,039
surviving but when we talk about

1960
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:31,599
creating intelligent machines we're not

1961
00:59:31,039 --> 00:59:33,599
creating

1962
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,960
life we're not creating evolving

1963
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,960
creatures we're not creating

1964
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,480
living things we're just creating a

1965
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:40,159
machine that can learn

1966
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,679
really sophisticated stuff and that

1967
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,558
machine it may even be able to talk to

1968
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:44,239
us

1969
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,680
but it doesn't it's not going to have a

1970
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:47,679
desire to live

1971
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:48,960
unless somehow we put it into that

1972
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:51,279
system well

1973
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,199
there's learning right the the thing is

1974
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:56,319
but you don't learn to like want to live

1975
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:58,318
that's built into you it's wow people

1976
00:59:56,318 --> 01:00:00,558
like ernest becker argue

1977
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:02,719
so okay uh there's the fact the

1978
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:05,440
finiteness of life

1979
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:06,719
the way we think about it is something

1980
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:09,519
we learn

1981
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:11,039
uh perhaps so okay yeah and some people

1982
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:13,280
decide they don't want to live

1983
01:00:11,039 --> 01:00:15,279
and some people decide you know you can

1984
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,599
but the desire to live is built in dna

1985
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:17,920
right

1986
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:19,920
but i think what i'm trying to get to is

1987
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:21,838
uh in order to accomplish goals

1988
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,519
it's useful to have the urgency of

1989
01:00:21,838 --> 01:00:24,078
mortality is what the stoics talked

1990
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:26,480
about

1991
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:28,720
is meditating in your mortality yeah it

1992
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:32,559
might be a very useful

1993
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:33,519
thing to do to die and have the urgency

1994
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:35,920
of death

1995
01:00:33,519 --> 01:00:37,838
and to realize that to uh conceive

1996
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,440
yourself as an entity

1997
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:41,279
that operates in this world that

1998
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:43,039
eventually will no longer be a part of

1999
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,040
this world and actually conceive of

2000
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,318
yourself as a conscious entity might be

2001
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:49,358
very useful

2002
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,239
for you to be a system that makes sense

2003
01:00:49,358 --> 01:00:53,279
of the world

2004
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:54,719
otherwise you might get lazy well okay

2005
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:56,480
we're going to build these machines

2006
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:57,118
right and so we're talking about

2007
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:01,599
building

2008
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:03,440
ais what but we're we're building the uh

2009
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:05,838
uh the the the equivalent of the

2010
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:08,480
cortical columns the uh the neocortex

2011
01:01:05,838 --> 01:01:09,358
the neocortex and the the question is

2012
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,798
where do they

2013
01:01:09,358 --> 01:01:13,920
arrive at because we're not hard-coding

2014
01:01:12,798 --> 01:01:16,159
everything in

2015
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:18,240
where uh well well in terms of if you

2016
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:20,480
build the neocortex equivalent

2017
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:21,838
it will not have any of these desires or

2018
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,639
emotional states now you can

2019
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:25,519
argue that that neocortex won't be

2020
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:27,279
useful

2021
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:28,798
unless i give it some agency unless i

2022
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,000
give it some desire unless i give it

2023
01:01:28,798 --> 01:01:31,358
some motivation otherwise you'll be as

2024
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:34,159
lazy and do nothing

2025
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,558
right you could argue that um but on its

2026
01:01:34,159 --> 01:01:36,159
own

2027
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,599
it's not going to do those things it's

2028
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,239
just not it's not going to sit there and

2029
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:40,079
say

2030
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:41,679
i understand the world therefore i care

2031
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,798
to live no it's not going to do that

2032
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:43,039
it's just going to say i understand the

2033
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:45,358
world

2034
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,558
why is that obvious to you why why why

2035
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:48,480
don't do you think it's

2036
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,839
okay let me ask it this way do you think

2037
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:54,880
it's possible

2038
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:58,880
it will at least assign to itself

2039
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:01,760
agency and perceive

2040
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:03,119
itself in this world as being a

2041
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:05,200
conscious entity

2042
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:07,358
as a useful way to operate in the world

2043
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:08,719
and and to make sense of the world

2044
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:10,639
i think intelligent machine could be

2045
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:13,118
conscious but that doesn't not

2046
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,318
again imply any of these um these

2047
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,119
desires and goals and

2048
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:18,159
and that you're worried about it we can

2049
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:19,280
i have a

2050
01:02:18,159 --> 01:02:21,038
we can talk about what it means for the

2051
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:23,039
machine to be conscious and by the way

2052
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,319
not worry about but get excited about

2053
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,079
it's not necessarily that we should

2054
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:27,279
worry about it so i think there's a

2055
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,200
legitimate

2056
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,039
problem or not problem a question asked

2057
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,239
if you build this modeling system what's

2058
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,960
it gonna model

2059
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:36,318
yes right what's it what's its desire

2060
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,440
what is it what's its goal what are we

2061
01:02:36,318 --> 01:02:39,679
applying it to

2062
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,960
right so that's an interesting question

2063
01:02:39,679 --> 01:02:42,960
um

2064
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:44,159
one thing if it and it depends on the

2065
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,760
application

2066
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:47,358
it's not something that inherent to the

2067
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:48,960
modeling system it's something we apply

2068
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:49,519
to the modeling system in a particular

2069
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,119
way

2070
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:53,759
so if i wanted to make a really smart

2071
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:56,480
car it would have to know

2072
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,319
about driving in cars and what's

2073
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:59,679
important in driving in cars

2074
01:02:58,318 --> 01:03:00,719
it's not going to figure that out on its

2075
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:02,399
own it's not going to sit there and say

2076
01:03:00,719 --> 01:03:04,959
you know i've understood the world

2077
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:06,000
and i've decided you know no no no we

2078
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,720
have to tell it we're going to have to

2079
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,400
say like

2080
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,239
so i imagine i make this car really

2081
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,160
smart it learns about your driving

2082
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:14,239
habits it learns about the world

2083
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:15,679
and it's just you know is it one day

2084
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,000
going to wake up and say

2085
01:03:15,679 --> 01:03:18,879
you know what i'm tired of driving and

2086
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:20,559
doing what you want

2087
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,079
i think i have better ideas about how to

2088
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,240
spend my time well

2089
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,839
okay no it's not going to do that part

2090
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:27,038
of me is playing a little bit of devil's

2091
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:29,279
advocate but part of me

2092
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:30,079
is also trying to think through this

2093
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,798
because

2094
01:03:30,079 --> 01:03:34,559
i've studied cars quite a bit and i

2095
01:03:32,798 --> 01:03:35,280
studied pedestrians and cyclists quite a

2096
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:38,559
bit

2097
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:41,599
and there's part of me that thinks

2098
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:41,599
that there needs to be

2099
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:46,240
more intelligence than we realize in

2100
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,920
order to drive successfully

2101
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:52,318
that game theory of human interaction

2102
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:53,838
seems to require some deep understanding

2103
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:58,400
of

2104
01:03:53,838 --> 01:04:00,318
of human nature that

2105
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,798
okay when a pedestrian crosses the

2106
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:05,838
street there's some sense

2107
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:07,358
they they look at a car usually and then

2108
01:04:05,838 --> 01:04:10,239
they look away

2109
01:04:07,358 --> 01:04:12,078
there's some sense in which they say i

2110
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,558
believe that you're not going to murder

2111
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,640
me

2112
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:16,640
you don't have the guts to murder me

2113
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:17,759
this is the little dance of pedestrian

2114
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,838
car interaction

2115
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:21,280
yeah is saying i'm going to look away

2116
01:04:19,838 --> 01:04:24,078
and i'm going to put my

2117
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:26,160
life in your hands because i think

2118
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,000
you're human you're not gonna kill me

2119
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:29,440
and then the car in order to

2120
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,318
successfully operate in

2121
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,798
like manhattan streets has to say no no

2122
01:04:32,318 --> 01:04:35,119
no

2123
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:36,400
i am going to kill you like a little bit

2124
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:37,599
there's a little bit of this weird

2125
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,760
inkling of

2126
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,039
mutual murder yeah yeah and that's a

2127
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,720
dance and then somehow

2128
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:43,839
successfully operate through do you

2129
01:04:42,719 --> 01:04:46,558
think you were born of that did you

2130
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:49,759
learn that social interaction

2131
01:04:46,559 --> 01:04:51,200
uh i think it might have a lot of the

2132
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,880
same elements that you're talking about

2133
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,960
which is we're leveraging

2134
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,880
things we were born with and applying

2135
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:59,358
them in the context

2136
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,798
that uh all right i would i would answer

2137
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:01,679
that i would have said that that kind of

2138
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:03,599
interaction

2139
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,719
is learned because you know people in

2140
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,680
different cultures have different

2141
01:05:04,719 --> 01:05:06,798
interactions like that

2142
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:08,000
if you cross the street in different

2143
01:05:06,798 --> 01:05:09,838
cities and different around the world

2144
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:11,039
they have different ways of interacting

2145
01:05:09,838 --> 01:05:12,318
i would say that's learned and i would

2146
01:05:11,039 --> 01:05:13,520
say an intelligent system could learn

2147
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:15,358
that too

2148
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:19,119
but that does not lead and the

2149
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:22,159
intelligent system can understand

2150
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:24,400
humans it could understand that you know

2151
01:05:22,159 --> 01:05:25,838
just like i can study an animal and

2152
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,200
learn something about that animal

2153
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,038
you know i could study apes and learn

2154
01:05:27,199 --> 01:05:31,519
something about their culture and so on

2155
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:32,240
i'd have to be an ape to know that um i

2156
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:33,519
may not be

2157
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:35,519
completely but i can understand

2158
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:36,880
something so intel's machine can model

2159
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:38,400
that that's this part of the world is

2160
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:40,400
this part of the interactions

2161
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,599
the question we're trying to get at will

2162
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,519
the intelligent machine

2163
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:45,680
have its own personal agency that's

2164
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:47,280
beyond you know what we assign to it or

2165
01:05:45,679 --> 01:05:49,199
it's its own personal

2166
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,798
you know goals or will it evolve and

2167
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:53,279
create these things

2168
01:05:50,798 --> 01:05:54,318
my confidence comes from understanding

2169
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:56,798
the mechanisms

2170
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,838
i'm talking about creating this is not

2171
01:05:56,798 --> 01:05:59,838
hand wave stuff

2172
01:05:57,838 --> 01:06:01,358
it's down in the details we i'm going to

2173
01:05:59,838 --> 01:06:02,400
build it and i know what it's going to

2174
01:06:01,358 --> 01:06:03,598
look like and i know it's

2175
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,720
going to behave i know what the kind of

2176
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:05,838
things it could do and the kind of

2177
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:07,919
things it can't do

2178
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:09,599
just like when i build a computer i know

2179
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:10,400
it's not going to on its own decide to

2180
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:12,880
put another

2181
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,519
register inside of it it can't do that

2182
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,720
no way

2183
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:16,639
no matter what your software does it

2184
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:19,598
can't add a register to the computer

2185
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:20,879
um so in this way when we build ai

2186
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:24,000
systems

2187
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:26,798
we have to make choices about the the

2188
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:27,838
the under the how we embed them so i

2189
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:28,318
talked about this in the book i said you

2190
01:06:27,838 --> 01:06:29,920
know

2191
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,679
it's a brain intelligence system is not

2192
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:34,240
just the neocortex equivalent

2193
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:36,159
you have to have that but it has to have

2194
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:36,798
some kind of embodiment physical a

2195
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,399
virtual

2196
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:40,480
it has to have some sort of goals it has

2197
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,160
to have some sort of uh ideas about

2198
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:44,318
dangers about things it shouldn't do

2199
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:46,719
like you know like we

2200
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:48,079
we build in safeguards into systems uh

2201
01:06:46,719 --> 01:06:49,199
we have them in our bodies we have put

2202
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:51,280
them into cars

2203
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:52,798
right you know my car follows my

2204
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:54,079
directions until the day it sees

2205
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:55,440
i'm about to hit something and it

2206
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:56,480
ignores my directions and puts the

2207
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,400
brakes on

2208
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,480
so we can build those things in so

2209
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,680
that's a very interesting problem

2210
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:06,798
um how to build those in i think my

2211
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:08,558
my my differing opinion about the risks

2212
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:10,559
of ai for most people

2213
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:12,000
is that people assume that somehow those

2214
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,200
things will just appear automatically

2215
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,838
it'll evolve and intelligence itself

2216
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:18,719
begets that stuff or requires it but

2217
01:07:17,838 --> 01:07:20,000
it's not intelligence

2218
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:21,358
of the neural cortex equipment doesn't

2219
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,079
require this the new cartridge equipment

2220
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:24,000
just says

2221
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:26,160
i'm a learning system tell me what you

2222
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,519
want me to learn and i'll tell you

2223
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:29,598
ask me questions i'll tell you the

2224
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:31,519
answers but

2225
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:32,960
in that again it's again like a map it

2226
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:35,358
doesn't a map has no

2227
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,000
intent about things but you can use it

2228
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:39,199
um

2229
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:42,639
to solve problems okay so the building

2230
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:43,838
engineering the neural cortex in itself

2231
01:07:42,639 --> 01:07:45,838
is just creating

2232
01:07:43,838 --> 01:07:47,119
an intelligent prediction system

2233
01:07:45,838 --> 01:07:49,679
modeling system

2234
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:52,480
sorry modeling system yeah uh you can

2235
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:54,558
use it to then make predictions and then

2236
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,880
but you can also put it inside a thing

2237
01:07:54,559 --> 01:07:59,599
that's actually acting in this world

2238
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,519
you have to put it inside something it's

2239
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,760
again think of the map analogy right map

2240
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:05,519
on its own doesn't do anything right

2241
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:07,440
it's just inert it's just it can learn

2242
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,440
but it's just so we have to embed it

2243
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:12,079
somehow in something to do something

2244
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:13,200
so so what's your intuition here you had

2245
01:08:12,079 --> 01:08:15,920
a conversation

2246
01:08:13,199 --> 01:08:17,838
with sam harris recently that was uh

2247
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,759
sort of um

2248
01:08:17,838 --> 01:08:21,198
you've had a bit of a disagreement and

2249
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,560
you're sticking on this point

2250
01:08:21,198 --> 01:08:28,559
you know elon musk stuart russell

2251
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:32,560
kind of have us worry existential

2252
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:34,798
threats of ai what's your intuition why

2253
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:37,440
if we engineer an increasingly

2254
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:40,000
intelligent neural cortex type of system

2255
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,960
in the computer why that shouldn't be a

2256
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:42,319
thing that we

2257
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,239
it was interesting we used the word

2258
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,960
intuition and sam harris used the word

2259
01:08:44,238 --> 01:08:47,198
intuition too

2260
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:48,640
and and when he used that intuition that

2261
01:08:47,198 --> 01:08:49,519
word i immediately stopped and said oh

2262
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:52,239
that's the

2263
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,440
problem he's using intuition i'm not

2264
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:54,718
speaking about my intuition

2265
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:56,238
yes i'm speaking about something i

2266
01:08:54,719 --> 01:08:57,359
understand something i'm going to build

2267
01:08:56,238 --> 01:08:59,678
something i am building

2268
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:01,440
something i understand completely or at

2269
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:03,199
least well enough to know what it's all

2270
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:04,798
i'm guessing i know what this thing's

2271
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:08,000
going to do and

2272
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:08,640
i think most people who are worried they

2273
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,319
have trouble

2274
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:11,520
separating out they don't have they

2275
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:12,239
don't have the um knowledge or the

2276
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,000
understanding

2277
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,358
about like what is intelligence how is

2278
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,798
it manifest in the brain how is it

2279
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,759
separate from these other functions in

2280
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:19,039
the brain

2281
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:20,880
and so they imagine it's going to be

2282
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:23,198
human-like or animal-like it's going to

2283
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,359
have it's going to have the same sort of

2284
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:27,039
drives and emotions we have but there's

2285
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:28,480
no reason for that

2286
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:30,399
that's just because there's there's

2287
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:31,678
unknown if you're if the unknown is like

2288
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:32,479
oh my god you know i don't know what

2289
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:33,920
this is going to do we have to be

2290
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:35,119
careful it could be like us but really

2291
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,798
smarter

2292
01:09:35,119 --> 01:09:38,318
i'm saying no it won't be like us it'll

2293
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:39,278
be really smart but it won't be like us

2294
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:42,080
at all

2295
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,040
and um and but i i'm coming from that

2296
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:45,278
not because i just

2297
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,880
guessing i'm not intuitive using

2298
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,000
intuition i'm basically like okay i

2299
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:48,480
understand this thing works this is what

2300
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,520
it does

2301
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:52,559
let me explain it to you okay but uh to

2302
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:54,719
push back

2303
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,640
so i also disagree with the the

2304
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:59,840
intuitions that sam has

2305
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,800
but but i also disagree with what you

2306
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:03,360
just said

2307
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:04,640
which you know what's a good uh analogy

2308
01:10:03,359 --> 01:10:07,759
so if you look at the

2309
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:09,679
twitter algorithm in in the early days

2310
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,960
just recommender systems you can

2311
01:10:09,679 --> 01:10:14,960
understand how recommender systems work

2312
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,880
what you can't understand in the early

2313
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,840
days is when you apply that recommender

2314
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,079
system at scale

2315
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,840
to thousands and millions of people how

2316
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:25,039
that can change societies

2317
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:27,119
yeah so the question is yes

2318
01:10:25,039 --> 01:10:28,880
you're just saying this is how an

2319
01:10:27,119 --> 01:10:31,039
engineer in neurocortex

2320
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,560
works but the ques like when you have a

2321
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:35,519
very useful

2322
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:37,280
uh tic toc type of service that goes

2323
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,600
viral when your neural cortex

2324
01:10:37,279 --> 01:10:41,599
goes viral and then millions of people

2325
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,000
start using it cannot destroy the world

2326
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,920
no

2327
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,279
uh well first of all this is back one

2328
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,600
thing i want to say is that uh

2329
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:49,279
ai is a dangerous technology i don't i'm

2330
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,400
not denying that all technology is

2331
01:10:49,279 --> 01:10:53,679
dangerous well an ai

2332
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:55,039
maybe particularly so yeah okay so um

2333
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:57,119
am i worried about it yeah i'm totally

2334
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,640
worried about it the the thing where

2335
01:10:57,119 --> 01:11:01,359
the narrow component we're talking about

2336
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,199
now is the existential risk of ai

2337
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:05,920
right so i want to make that distinction

2338
01:11:03,198 --> 01:11:07,919
because i think ai can be applied poorly

2339
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:08,960
it can be applied in ways that you know

2340
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:12,158
people are going to

2341
01:11:08,960 --> 01:11:14,800
understand the consequences of it

2342
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:16,079
these are all potentially very bad

2343
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,640
things

2344
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,719
but they're not the ai system creating

2345
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,400
this existential risk on its own

2346
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,920
and that's the only place i disagree

2347
01:11:22,399 --> 01:11:26,158
with other people right so

2348
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,960
so i i think the existential risk thing

2349
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,279
is um

2350
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:32,000
humans are really damn good at surviving

2351
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:34,479
so to kill off the human race

2352
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:36,479
it'd be very very difficult you can even

2353
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:38,319
yes but you can even i'll go further i

2354
01:11:36,479 --> 01:11:40,399
don't think ai systems are ever going to

2355
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:41,519
try to i don't think ar systems are ever

2356
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:43,039
going to like say

2357
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,360
i'm going to ignore you i'm going to do

2358
01:11:43,039 --> 01:11:47,039
what i think is best

2359
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:48,880
i don't think that's going to happen at

2360
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:52,560
least not in the way

2361
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,840
i'm talking about it so you the twitter

2362
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,760
recommendation algorithm this

2363
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:57,679
interesting example

2364
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:59,440
let's let's use computer as an analogy

2365
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:00,960
again right

2366
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:02,639
i build a computer it's a universal

2367
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,920
computing machine i can't predict what

2368
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,840
people are going to use it for they can

2369
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:07,600
build all kinds of things they can

2370
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,000
they can even create computer viruses

2371
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:12,000
it's you know all kinds of stuff

2372
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,079
so there's some unknown about its

2373
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,520
utility about where it's going to go

2374
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,198
but on the other hand i pointed out that

2375
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:19,199
once i build a computer

2376
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:20,319
it's not going to fundamentally change

2377
01:12:19,198 --> 01:12:21,519
how it computes

2378
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:23,119
it's like i use the example of a

2379
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,080
register which is a part internal part

2380
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:26,559
of a computer

2381
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:27,920
um you know i say it can't just say

2382
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,600
because computers don't evolve

2383
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:30,800
they don't replicate they don't evolve

2384
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:32,400
they don't you know the physical

2385
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,239
manifestation of the computer itself

2386
01:12:32,399 --> 01:12:36,319
is not gonna there's certain things it

2387
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:37,839
can't do right so we can

2388
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:39,599
break into things like things that are

2389
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,840
possible to happen we can't predict

2390
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:43,280
and things are just impossible to happen

2391
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:44,560
unless we go out of our way to make them

2392
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:46,399
happen they're not going to happen

2393
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:47,840
unless somebody makes them happen yeah

2394
01:12:46,399 --> 01:12:48,479
so there's there's a bunch of things to

2395
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:50,640
say one

2396
01:12:48,479 --> 01:12:51,839
is the physical aspect which you're

2397
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:54,320
absolutely right

2398
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:55,760
we have to build a thing for it to

2399
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:58,880
operate in the physical world

2400
01:12:55,760 --> 01:13:01,760
and you can just stop building them uh

2401
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:03,279
you know the moment they're not doing

2402
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:04,239
the thing you want them to do or just

2403
01:13:03,279 --> 01:13:06,238
change the design

2404
01:13:04,238 --> 01:13:07,678
or change the design the question is i

2405
01:13:06,238 --> 01:13:08,479
mean there's it's possible in the

2406
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,800
physical world

2407
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:12,559
this is probably longer term is you

2408
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,159
automate the building

2409
01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:15,440
it makes it makes a lot of sense to

2410
01:13:14,158 --> 01:13:16,719
automate the building there's a lot of

2411
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:17,198
factories that are doing more and more

2412
01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:20,158
and more

2413
01:13:17,198 --> 01:13:21,359
automation to go from raw resources to

2414
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:23,279
the final product

2415
01:13:21,359 --> 01:13:25,119
it's possible to imagine that it's

2416
01:13:23,279 --> 01:13:28,238
obviously much more efficient to keep

2417
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:31,039
to create a factory that's creating

2418
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:32,879
robots that do something you know do

2419
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,679
something extremely useful for society

2420
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:35,920
it could be uh

2421
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:37,840
personal assistance it could be uh it

2422
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:39,039
could be it could be your toaster but a

2423
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:40,880
toaster that's much

2424
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:42,800
has deeper knowledge of your culinary

2425
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:45,039
preferences yeah

2426
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,079
and and that could uh well i think now

2427
01:13:45,039 --> 01:13:47,600
you've hit on the right thing the real

2428
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:50,319
thing we need to be worried about lex

2429
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:52,079
is self-replication right that is the

2430
01:13:50,319 --> 01:13:54,238
thing that we're in the physical world

2431
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:55,519
yeah or even the virtual world

2432
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:57,439
self-replication

2433
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,800
because self-replication is dangerous

2434
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:00,960
it's probably more likely to be killed

2435
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,320
by a virus you know or a human

2436
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:04,079
engineered virus

2437
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:05,840
anybody can create you know this the

2438
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:06,960
technology is getting so almost anybody

2439
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,719
but not anybody but

2440
01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:10,480
a lot of people could create a

2441
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:12,158
human-engineered virus that could wipe

2442
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:13,759
out humanity

2443
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,719
that is really dangerous no intelligence

2444
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:19,920
required just self-replication

2445
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:20,560
so um so we need to be careful about

2446
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,600
that

2447
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,280
so when i think about you know ai

2448
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:27,280
i'm not thinking about robots building

2449
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:29,439
robots don't do that don't build a

2450
01:14:27,279 --> 01:14:31,599
you know just well that's because you're

2451
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:34,639
interested in creating intelligence

2452
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,880
it seems like self-replication

2453
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:37,760
is a good way to make a lot of money

2454
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,800
well fine but

2455
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:42,079
so is you know maybe editing viruses is

2456
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,480
a good way to i don't know

2457
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:46,960
the point is if as a society when we

2458
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:49,919
want to look at existential risks

2459
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:51,198
the existential risks we face that that

2460
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:52,800
we can control

2461
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:54,719
almost all evolve around

2462
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:57,920
self-replication yes

2463
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:59,198
the question is i don't see a good uh

2464
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:01,119
way to make a lot of money by

2465
01:14:59,198 --> 01:15:02,079
engineering viruses and deploying them

2466
01:15:01,119 --> 01:15:03,119
in the world

2467
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:04,719
there could be there will be

2468
01:15:03,119 --> 01:15:05,840
applications that are useful but let's

2469
01:15:04,719 --> 01:15:07,760
separate out let's

2470
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:09,199
separate out i mean you don't need to

2471
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,159
you only need some you know terrorists

2472
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:12,079
who wants to do it because it doesn't

2473
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:15,039
take a lot of money to make viruses

2474
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:16,640
um let's just separate out what's risky

2475
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:18,399
and what's not risky

2476
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:19,679
i'm arguing that the intelligence side

2477
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:21,279
of this equation is not risky it's not

2478
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:22,640
risky it's not risky at all

2479
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:24,800
it's the self-replication side of the

2480
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,719
equation is risky and

2481
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:28,880
i'm not dismissing that i'm scared as

2482
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:32,319
hell it's like the paperclip

2483
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:32,880
maximizer thing yeah those are often

2484
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:36,319
like

2485
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,560
talked about in the same conversation um

2486
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:40,719
i think you're right like creating

2487
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:44,400
ultra-intelligent super-intelligent

2488
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:46,000
systems is not necessarily coupled with

2489
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:47,279
the self-replicating arbitrarily

2490
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,719
self-replicating systems

2491
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:50,479
yeah and you don't get evolution unless

2492
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:52,800
you're self-replicating yeah

2493
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:54,319
and so i think that's the gist of this

2494
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:56,719
argument that people have trouble

2495
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:58,479
separating those two out they just think

2496
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:59,920
oh yeah intelligence is like us

2497
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:01,919
and look how look at the damage we've

2498
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:03,119
done to this planet like how we've

2499
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:05,199
you know destroyed all these other

2500
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:06,719
species yeah well we replicate we're

2501
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:08,799
eight billion of us are seven million of

2502
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:11,279
us now so um

2503
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,239
i think the idea is that the the more

2504
01:16:11,279 --> 01:16:14,399
intelligent

2505
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:15,678
we're able to build systems the more

2506
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:17,599
tempting

2507
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,279
it becomes from a capitalist perspective

2508
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:20,079
of creating products the more tempting

2509
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:23,198
it becomes to create

2510
01:16:20,079 --> 01:16:25,439
self uh reproduction systems all right

2511
01:16:23,198 --> 01:16:26,719
so let's say that's true so does that

2512
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:28,158
mean we don't build intelligent systems

2513
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,880
no that means we regulate

2514
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:32,000
we we understand the risks uh we

2515
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,480
regulate them

2516
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:36,319
yeah uh you know look there's a lot of

2517
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:37,678
things we could do a society which have

2518
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:38,319
some sort of financial benefit to

2519
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:40,960
someone

2520
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:42,559
which could do a lot of harm and we have

2521
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:43,840
to learn how to regulate those things

2522
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,760
we have to learn how to deal with those

2523
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:46,319
things i will argue this i would say the

2524
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:48,560
opposite

2525
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:49,920
i would say having intelligent machines

2526
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:52,000
at our disposal

2527
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,520
will actually help us in the end more

2528
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,880
because it'll help us understand these

2529
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,320
risks better and help us mitigate these

2530
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,880
risk riders there might be ways of

2531
01:16:56,319 --> 01:16:58,399
saying oh

2532
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,840
well how do we solve climate change

2533
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:01,920
problems you know how do we do this or

2534
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:05,119
how do we do that

2535
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:06,399
that just like computers are dangerous

2536
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:08,000
in the hands of the wrong people but

2537
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:09,839
they've been so great for so many other

2538
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,198
things we live with those dangers

2539
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,199
and i think we have to do the same with

2540
01:17:11,198 --> 01:17:15,198
intelligent machines we just but we have

2541
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:17,759
to be constantly vigilant about

2542
01:17:15,198 --> 01:17:19,359
this idea of a bad actors doing bad

2543
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:21,600
things with them and b

2544
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:23,198
um don't ever ever create a

2545
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,679
self-replicating system

2546
01:17:23,198 --> 01:17:27,119
um and by the way i don't even know if

2547
01:17:25,679 --> 01:17:27,679
you could create a self-replicating

2548
01:17:27,119 --> 01:17:29,359
system

2549
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,039
that uses a factory that's really

2550
01:17:29,359 --> 01:17:33,039
dangerous you know

2551
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:34,079
nature's way of self-replicating is so

2552
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:36,399
amazing

2553
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:37,279
um you know it doesn't require anything

2554
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:39,359
it just me know

2555
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,960
the thing and resources and it goes

2556
01:17:39,359 --> 01:17:42,719
right yeah

2557
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:44,000
if i said to you you know what we have

2558
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:45,600
to build uh

2559
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,920
our goal is to build a factory that can

2560
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:51,120
make that builds new factories

2561
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:54,000
and it has to end to end supply chain

2562
01:17:51,119 --> 01:17:55,519
it has to mine the resources get the

2563
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,560
energy

2564
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:59,760
i mean that's really hard it's you know

2565
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,159
no one's doing that in the next

2566
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,800
you know 100 years i've been extremely

2567
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:05,920
impressed

2568
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:07,279
by the efforts of elon musk and tesla to

2569
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,239
try to do exactly that

2570
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:11,119
not not from raw resource well he

2571
01:18:10,238 --> 01:18:13,039
actually i think

2572
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:14,399
states the goal is to go from raw

2573
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:17,519
resource to the

2574
01:18:14,399 --> 01:18:19,439
uh the final car in one factory yeah

2575
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,040
that's that's the main goal of course

2576
01:18:19,439 --> 01:18:22,799
it's not currently possible

2577
01:18:21,039 --> 01:18:24,158
but they're taking huge leaps well he's

2578
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:25,760
not the only one to do that

2579
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:27,599
this has been a goal for many uh

2580
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:29,679
industries for a long long time

2581
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,440
um it's difficult to do well a lot of

2582
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:32,158
people what they do is instead they have

2583
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:34,719
like

2584
01:18:32,158 --> 01:18:35,359
a million suppliers and then they like

2585
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,000
there's

2586
01:18:35,359 --> 01:18:38,559
everybody's men they all co-locate them

2587
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:40,640
and

2588
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:42,400
they tie the systems together it's it's

2589
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:44,560
a fundamentally distributed even

2590
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:46,319
i think that's that also is not getting

2591
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:49,440
at the issue i was just talking about um

2592
01:18:46,319 --> 01:18:52,840
which is self-replication it's

2593
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:55,519
um i mean self-replication means there's

2594
01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:56,960
no entity involved other than the entity

2595
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:59,280
that's replicating

2596
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,319
um right and so if there's humans in

2597
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:02,158
this in the loop

2598
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:03,519
that's not really self-replicating right

2599
01:19:02,158 --> 01:19:06,799
it's unless

2600
01:19:03,520 --> 01:19:11,520
somehow we're duped but

2601
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,520
it's also i i don't necessarily

2602
01:19:11,920 --> 01:19:16,319
agree with you because you've kind of

2603
01:19:13,279 --> 01:19:19,039
mentioned that ai will not say no to us

2604
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:19,439
i i just think they will yeah yeah so

2605
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:22,800
like

2606
01:19:19,439 --> 01:19:24,879
uh i think it's a useful feature to

2607
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:27,679
build in i'm just trying to like

2608
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,760
uh put myself in the mind of engineers

2609
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:32,880
to sometimes say no

2610
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:34,400
you know if you you yeah well i gave an

2611
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,279
example earlier right i get an example

2612
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:38,238
of my car

2613
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:38,639
yeah right my car turns the wheel and

2614
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:40,639
and

2615
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,760
applies the accelerator and the brake as

2616
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:43,760
i say until

2617
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,440
it decides there's something dangerous

2618
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:48,480
yes and then it doesn't do that

2619
01:19:45,439 --> 01:19:50,639
yeah now that was something

2620
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,319
it didn't decide to do is something we

2621
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:55,920
programmed into the car

2622
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:57,920
uh and so good it was a good idea right

2623
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,279
the question again isn't like if we

2624
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,719
create an intelligent system will it

2625
01:19:59,279 --> 01:20:02,639
ever

2626
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:04,319
ignore our commands of course it will on

2627
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,800
sometimes is it going to do it because

2628
01:20:04,319 --> 01:20:07,679
it came

2629
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,560
up came up with its own goals that serve

2630
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:10,319
its purposes

2631
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:12,480
and it doesn't care about our purposes

2632
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:14,399
no i don't think that's going to happen

2633
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:16,079
okay so let me ask you about these uh

2634
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:16,960
super intelligent cortical systems that

2635
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:19,840
we engineer

2636
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,840
and us humans

2637
01:20:20,079 --> 01:20:24,319
do you think uh with these entities

2638
01:20:22,479 --> 01:20:26,158
operating out there in the world

2639
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:27,679
what does the future most promising

2640
01:20:26,158 --> 01:20:30,879
future look like is it

2641
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:34,158
us merging with them

2642
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:36,319
or is it us like how do we keep

2643
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:38,158
us humans around when you have

2644
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:40,639
increasingly intelligent beings is it

2645
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,238
uh one of the dreams is to upload our

2646
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:45,600
minds in the digital space

2647
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:47,919
so can we just give our minds

2648
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,880
to these uh systems yeah so they can

2649
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,319
operate on them

2650
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,920
is there some kind of more interesting

2651
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:53,198
merger or is there more more

2652
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:54,800
in the third part of my book i talked

2653
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:55,678
about all these scenarios and let me

2654
01:20:54,800 --> 01:21:00,880
just walk through them

2655
01:20:55,679 --> 01:21:03,679
sure um the uploading the mind one yes

2656
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:05,679
extremely really difficult to do like

2657
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:08,880
like we have no idea how to do this even

2658
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:10,399
remotely right now um so it would be a

2659
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:11,920
very long way away

2660
01:21:10,399 --> 01:21:13,599
but i make the argument you wouldn't

2661
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,760
like the result

2662
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:17,199
um and you wouldn't be pleased with the

2663
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:18,159
result it's really not what you think

2664
01:21:17,198 --> 01:21:19,759
it's going to be

2665
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:21,519
um imagine i could upload your brain

2666
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:22,639
into into a computer right now and now

2667
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,360
the computer's sitting there going hey

2668
01:21:22,639 --> 01:21:25,600
i'm over here

2669
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:26,799
great get rid of that old bio person i

2670
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,520
don't need them you're still sitting

2671
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,760
here

2672
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,440
yeah what are you gonna do no no that's

2673
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:32,400
not me i'm here right yeah are you gonna

2674
01:21:31,439 --> 01:21:34,399
feel satisfied

2675
01:21:32,399 --> 01:21:35,839
that then you but people imagine look

2676
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:37,839
i'm on my deathbed and

2677
01:21:35,840 --> 01:21:39,840
i'm about to you know expire and i push

2678
01:21:37,840 --> 01:21:41,440
the button and now i'm uploaded but

2679
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,760
think about it a little differently and

2680
01:21:41,439 --> 01:21:44,719
and so i don't think it's going to be a

2681
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,880
thing because people

2682
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:47,920
by the time we're able to do this if

2683
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:49,440
ever

2684
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:51,039
because you have to replicate the entire

2685
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:52,638
body not just the brain it's

2686
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:54,840
it's really it's i walk through the

2687
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:57,440
issues it's really substantial

2688
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,840
um do you have a sense of what makes us

2689
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,960
us

2690
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,800
is there is there a shortcut to what can

2691
01:22:00,960 --> 01:22:05,279
only save a certain part

2692
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:06,480
that makes us truly ours no but i think

2693
01:22:05,279 --> 01:22:07,279
that machine would feel like it's you

2694
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:09,359
too

2695
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:11,119
right right if you people just like i

2696
01:22:09,359 --> 01:22:12,399
have a child i have a child right i have

2697
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:13,920
two daughters

2698
01:22:12,399 --> 01:22:15,439
they're independent people i created

2699
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:19,199
them well partly yeah

2700
01:22:15,439 --> 01:22:21,198
and um uh i don't

2701
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:22,638
just because they're somewhat like me i

2702
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:24,238
don't feel i'm them and they don't feel

2703
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:25,199
like i'm me so if you split it apart you

2704
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:27,279
have two people so

2705
01:22:25,198 --> 01:22:28,879
we can come back to what what makes what

2706
01:22:27,279 --> 01:22:29,519
consciousness we want we can talk about

2707
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:31,279
that

2708
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,480
but we don't have a remote consciousness

2709
01:22:31,279 --> 01:22:34,238
i'm not sitting there going oh i'm

2710
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:36,638
conscious of that you know i mean that

2711
01:22:34,238 --> 01:22:38,238
system over there so let's say let's

2712
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:40,960
let's stay on our topic okay so

2713
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:42,479
one was uploading a brand yep ain't

2714
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:44,480
gonna happen in a hundred years

2715
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:46,000
maybe a thousand but i don't think

2716
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:49,039
people are gonna wanna do it

2717
01:22:46,000 --> 01:22:50,840
the merging your mind with uh

2718
01:22:49,039 --> 01:22:52,719
you know the neural link thing right

2719
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:54,319
like again

2720
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,158
really really difficult it's it's one

2721
01:22:54,319 --> 01:22:57,840
thing to make progress to control a

2722
01:22:56,158 --> 01:22:58,559
prosthetic arm it's another to have like

2723
01:22:57,840 --> 01:23:00,639
a billion

2724
01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:02,719
or several billion you know things and

2725
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:04,000
understanding what those signals mean

2726
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:06,079
like it's the one thing they're like

2727
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:07,520
okay i can learn to think some patterns

2728
01:23:06,079 --> 01:23:09,119
to make something happen

2729
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,199
it's quite another thing to have a

2730
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:12,800
system a computer which actually knows

2731
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:14,319
exactly which cells it's talking to and

2732
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:15,760
how it's talking to them and interacting

2733
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:17,279
in a way like that

2734
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:18,880
very very difficult we're not getting

2735
01:23:17,279 --> 01:23:21,679
anywhere closer to that

2736
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:23,440
um interesting can i uh can i ask a

2737
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:26,079
question here

2738
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:26,960
what so for me what makes that merger

2739
01:23:26,079 --> 01:23:30,238
very difficult

2740
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:32,880
practically in the next 10 20 50 years

2741
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:34,079
is like literally the biology side of it

2742
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:35,359
which is like

2743
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:37,679
it's just hard to do that kind of

2744
01:23:35,359 --> 01:23:39,839
surgery in a safe way

2745
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:41,199
but your intuition is even the machine

2746
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:42,880
learning

2747
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:44,960
part of it where the machine has to

2748
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:45,760
learn what the heck it's talking to

2749
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,158
that's even hard

2750
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:49,840
i think it's even harder and it's not

2751
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:51,679
it's it's easy to do when you're talking

2752
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,920
about hundreds of signals

2753
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:54,960
it's it's a totally different thing to

2754
01:23:53,920 --> 01:23:55,600
say you're talking about billions of

2755
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,158
signals

2756
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:59,280
so you don't think it's the raw it's a

2757
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:00,158
machine learning problem you don't think

2758
01:23:59,279 --> 01:24:02,079
it could be learned

2759
01:24:00,158 --> 01:24:03,599
well i'm just saying no i think you'd

2760
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:05,119
have to have detailed knowledge

2761
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,120
you'd have to know exactly what the

2762
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:08,319
types of neurons you're connecting to

2763
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:09,439
i mean in the brain there's these

2764
01:24:08,319 --> 01:24:10,559
they're neurons that do all different

2765
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:12,479
types of things it's not like a neural

2766
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,159
network it's a very complex organism

2767
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:15,759
system up here we talked about the grid

2768
01:24:14,158 --> 01:24:16,719
cells or the place cells you know you

2769
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,920
have to know what kind of cells you're

2770
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:19,679
talking to and what they're doing and

2771
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:21,760
how their timing works and all

2772
01:24:19,679 --> 01:24:23,359
all this stuff which you can't today

2773
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,199
there's no way of doing that right

2774
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:26,639
but i think it's i think it's a i think

2775
01:24:25,198 --> 01:24:27,359
the problem you're right that the

2776
01:24:26,639 --> 01:24:28,800
biological

2777
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:30,158
aspect of like who wants to have surgery

2778
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:30,719
and have this stuff inserted in your

2779
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:32,638
brain

2780
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:34,000
that's a problem but this is when we

2781
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:35,840
solve that problem

2782
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:37,439
i think the the information coding

2783
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:38,880
aspect is much worse

2784
01:24:37,439 --> 01:24:40,399
i think that's much more it's not like

2785
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:42,159
what they're doing today today it's

2786
01:24:40,399 --> 01:24:44,079
simple machine learning stuff

2787
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:46,000
because you're doing simple things but

2788
01:24:44,079 --> 01:24:46,559
if you want to merge your brain like i'm

2789
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,560
thinking

2790
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,080
on the internet i'm merge my brain with

2791
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,920
the machine and we're both doing

2792
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:54,079
i that's a totally different issue

2793
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:57,760
that's interesting i i tend to think if

2794
01:24:54,079 --> 01:25:00,639
okay if you have a super clean signal

2795
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:02,639
from a bunch of neurons at the start you

2796
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:05,840
don't know what those neurons are

2797
01:25:02,639 --> 01:25:08,159
i think that's much easier than

2798
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:09,119
the getting of the clean signal i think

2799
01:25:08,158 --> 01:25:10,879
if you

2800
01:25:09,119 --> 01:25:12,479
think about today's machine learning

2801
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:14,239
that's what you would conclude

2802
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:15,759
right i'm thinking about what's going on

2803
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:17,359
in the brain and i don't reach that

2804
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:20,239
conclusion so we'll have to see

2805
01:25:17,359 --> 01:25:21,519
sure but i don't think even even then i

2806
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:25,119
think there's kind of a sad

2807
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,520
future like you know do i do i have to

2808
01:25:25,119 --> 01:25:27,279
like

2809
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:28,960
plug my brain into a computer i'm still

2810
01:25:27,279 --> 01:25:30,000
a biological organism i assume i'm still

2811
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:32,079
going to die

2812
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,679
so what what have i achieved right you

2813
01:25:32,079 --> 01:25:34,238
know what have i achieved to do some

2814
01:25:33,679 --> 01:25:37,279
sort of oh

2815
01:25:34,238 --> 01:25:38,638
i i disagree we don't know what those

2816
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:40,158
are but it seems like there could be a

2817
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:43,279
lot of different applications

2818
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:45,198
it's like virtual reality is to expand

2819
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:47,759
your brain's capability to uh

2820
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:49,198
to to like to read wikipedia yeah but

2821
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:50,880
but fine but but you're still a

2822
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:51,359
biological organization yes yes you know

2823
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:52,639
you're still

2824
01:25:51,359 --> 01:25:54,639
you're still mortal you're still all

2825
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:56,079
right so what are you accomplishing

2826
01:25:54,639 --> 01:25:58,159
you're making your life in this

2827
01:25:56,079 --> 01:25:59,359
short period of time better right just

2828
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,039
like uh

2829
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:02,559
having the internet made our life better

2830
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:04,800
yeah yeah okay so i

2831
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:06,560
i think that's of of if i think about

2832
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,079
all the possible gains we can have here

2833
01:26:06,560 --> 01:26:11,120
that's a marginal one

2834
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:12,559
it's an individual hey i'm better you

2835
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:15,279
know i'm smarter

2836
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,960
um but you know fine i'm not against it

2837
01:26:15,279 --> 01:26:19,759
i just don't think it's earth-changing

2838
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:20,239
i but so this is the true of the

2839
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,560
internet

2840
01:26:20,238 --> 01:26:24,000
when each of us individuals are smarter

2841
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:24,800
we get a chance to then share our

2842
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,479
smartness

2843
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,159
we get smarter and smarter together as

2844
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:29,279
like as a collective this is kind of

2845
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:30,399
like this ant colony

2846
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:31,519
but why don't i just create an

2847
01:26:30,399 --> 01:26:33,519
intelligent machine that doesn't have

2848
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:35,679
any of this biological nonsense

2849
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:36,719
this is all the same it's it's

2850
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:39,600
everything except

2851
01:26:36,719 --> 01:26:39,920
don't burden it with my brain yeah right

2852
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:41,600
it

2853
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:43,679
has a brain it is smart it's like my

2854
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:45,840
child but it's much much smarter than me

2855
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:47,760
so i have a choice between doing some

2856
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:49,440
implant doing some hybrid weird you know

2857
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:50,079
biological thing that bleeding and all

2858
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:53,439
these problems

2859
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:55,198
and limited by my brain or creating a

2860
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:56,319
system which is super smart that i can

2861
01:26:55,198 --> 01:26:58,000
talk to

2862
01:26:56,319 --> 01:26:59,198
um that helps me understand the world

2863
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:00,719
they can read the inter you know read

2864
01:26:59,198 --> 01:27:03,599
wikipedia and talk to me

2865
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:04,639
i i guess my uh the open questions there

2866
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:07,360
are

2867
01:27:04,639 --> 01:27:09,279
what does the manifestation of super

2868
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:11,279
intelligence look like so

2869
01:27:09,279 --> 01:27:13,279
like what are we going to you talked

2870
01:27:11,279 --> 01:27:14,000
about why do i want to merge with ai

2871
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:16,880
like what

2872
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:17,359
what's the actual marginal benefit here

2873
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,719
if i

2874
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:24,479
if we have a super intelligent system

2875
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:26,480
yeah how will it make our life better

2876
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:28,079
so let's let's that's a great question

2877
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:28,718
but let's break it down to little pieces

2878
01:27:28,079 --> 01:27:30,639
all right

2879
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:32,000
on the one hand it can make our life

2880
01:27:30,639 --> 01:27:33,840
better in lots of simple ways

2881
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:35,520
you mentioned like a care robot or

2882
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:36,960
something that helps me do things it

2883
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:38,239
cooks i don't know what it does right

2884
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,719
little things like that we have soup

2885
01:27:38,238 --> 01:27:43,439
better smarter cars we can have

2886
01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:44,880
you know better agents and aids helping

2887
01:27:43,439 --> 01:27:46,319
us in our work environment and things

2888
01:27:44,880 --> 01:27:47,359
like that to me that's like the easy

2889
01:27:46,319 --> 01:27:50,399
stuff the

2890
01:27:47,359 --> 01:27:52,079
simple stuff in the beginning um

2891
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:53,679
and so in the same way that computers

2892
01:27:52,079 --> 01:27:55,840
made our lives better in

2893
01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:57,600
ways many many ways i will have those

2894
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:00,560
kind of things

2895
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,120
to me the really exciting thing about ai

2896
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,199
is

2897
01:28:01,119 --> 01:28:05,279
sort of its transcendent transcendent

2898
01:28:03,198 --> 01:28:07,198
quality in terms of humanity

2899
01:28:05,279 --> 01:28:08,639
we're still biological organisms we're

2900
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:09,759
still stuck here on earth

2901
01:28:08,639 --> 01:28:11,840
it's going to be hard for us to live

2902
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,880
anywhere else i don't think

2903
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,600
you and i are going to want to live on

2904
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:18,800
mars anytime soon

2905
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,480
and um and we're flawed

2906
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,840
you know we may end up destroying

2907
01:28:20,479 --> 01:28:24,959
ourselves it's

2908
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:26,480
totally possible uh we if not completely

2909
01:28:24,960 --> 01:28:28,480
we could destroy our civilizations

2910
01:28:26,479 --> 01:28:30,158
you know it's let's face the fact we

2911
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:32,079
have issues here

2912
01:28:30,158 --> 01:28:33,679
but we can create intelligent machines

2913
01:28:32,079 --> 01:28:35,039
that can help us in various ways for

2914
01:28:33,679 --> 01:28:36,719
example one example i gave

2915
01:28:35,039 --> 01:28:38,639
another sounds a little sci-fi but i

2916
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:39,520
believe this if we really wanted to live

2917
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:41,039
on mars

2918
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:43,360
we'd have to have intelligent systems

2919
01:28:41,039 --> 01:28:43,760
that go there and build the habitat for

2920
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:45,599
us

2921
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,280
not humans humans are never going to do

2922
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:49,360
this it's just too hard

2923
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:50,559
um but could we have a thousand or ten

2924
01:28:49,359 --> 01:28:52,238
thousand you know

2925
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:54,000
engineer workers up there doing this

2926
01:28:52,238 --> 01:28:54,479
stuff building things terraforming mars

2927
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:56,719
sure

2928
01:28:54,479 --> 01:28:58,000
maybe we can move to mars but then if we

2929
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:58,639
want to if we want to go around the

2930
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:00,079
universe

2931
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:01,520
should i send my children around the

2932
01:29:00,079 --> 01:29:03,039
universe or should i send some

2933
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:04,000
intelligent machine which is like a

2934
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:06,079
child

2935
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,119
that represents me and understands our

2936
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:09,920
needs here on earth

2937
01:29:07,119 --> 01:29:10,479
that could travel through space so it's

2938
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:12,399
sort of

2939
01:29:10,479 --> 01:29:13,759
it in some sense intelligence allows us

2940
01:29:12,399 --> 01:29:17,439
to transcend our

2941
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:19,199
the limitations of our biology uh

2942
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:20,799
with and and don't think of it as a

2943
01:29:19,198 --> 01:29:23,919
negative thing it's in some sense

2944
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:24,239
my children transcend my the my biology

2945
01:29:23,920 --> 01:29:27,119
too

2946
01:29:24,238 --> 01:29:27,919
because they they live beyond me yeah um

2947
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:29,359
and we impart

2948
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,800
they represent me and they also have

2949
01:29:29,359 --> 01:29:31,839
their own knowledge and i can impart

2950
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:33,039
knowledge to them so intelligent

2951
01:29:31,840 --> 01:29:35,840
machines will be like that too

2952
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:37,119
but not limited like us but the question

2953
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:39,279
is um

2954
01:29:37,119 --> 01:29:40,319
there's so many ways that transcendence

2955
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:43,119
can happen

2956
01:29:40,319 --> 01:29:44,158
and the merger with ai and humans is one

2957
01:29:43,119 --> 01:29:48,158
of those ways so

2958
01:29:44,158 --> 01:29:49,039
you said intelligent basically beings or

2959
01:29:48,158 --> 01:29:50,638
systems

2960
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:53,198
propagating throughout the universe

2961
01:29:50,639 --> 01:29:54,800
representing us humans

2962
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:56,158
they represent us humans in the sense

2963
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:57,199
they represent our knowledge and our

2964
01:29:56,158 --> 01:30:00,638
history

2965
01:29:57,198 --> 01:30:03,759
not us individually right

2966
01:30:00,639 --> 01:30:05,600
right but i mean the question is is it

2967
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:08,480
just the database

2968
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:09,039
with uh with the really damn good uh

2969
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:11,039
model

2970
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:12,319
no they're conscious conscious just like

2971
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:14,560
us okay

2972
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:16,158
but just different they're different

2973
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:18,400
just like my children are different

2974
01:30:16,158 --> 01:30:20,000
they're like me but they're different um

2975
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:23,119
these are more different

2976
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,840
i guess maybe i've already i kind of

2977
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:26,319
i take a very broad view of our life

2978
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,560
here on

2979
01:30:26,319 --> 01:30:29,759
on earth i say you know why are we

2980
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:30,960
living here are we just living because

2981
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:32,560
we live

2982
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,719
is are we surviving because we can

2983
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:36,560
survive are we fighting just because

2984
01:30:34,719 --> 01:30:38,399
we want to just keep going what's the

2985
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:40,480
point of it yeah right

2986
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:42,638
so to me the point if i ask myself

2987
01:30:40,479 --> 01:30:46,158
what's the point of life is

2988
01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:48,239
what transcends that ephemeral sort of

2989
01:30:46,158 --> 01:30:51,599
biological experience

2990
01:30:48,238 --> 01:30:53,359
is to me this is my answer is

2991
01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,760
the acquisition of knowledge to

2992
01:30:53,359 --> 01:30:58,238
understand more about the universe

2993
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:58,880
and to explore and that's partly to

2994
01:30:58,238 --> 01:31:02,718
learn more

2995
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:05,840
right i don't view it as

2996
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:08,880
a terrible thing if the ultimate

2997
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:09,920
outcome of humanity is we create systems

2998
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,520
that are intelligent

2999
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,279
that are our offspring but are not like

3000
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:14,880
us at all and we stay

3001
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:17,519
we stay here and live on earth as long

3002
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:20,800
as we can which won't be forever

3003
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:22,960
but as long as we can and

3004
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,480
but that would be a great thing to do

3005
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:28,158
it's not a it's not like a

3006
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:31,919
negative thing well would uh

3007
01:31:28,158 --> 01:31:34,638
you'd be okay then if uh the human

3008
01:31:31,920 --> 01:31:35,520
species vanishes but our knowledge is

3009
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,079
preserved

3010
01:31:35,520 --> 01:31:39,440
and keeps being expanded by intelligent

3011
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:41,679
systems

3012
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:42,719
i want our knowledge to be preserved and

3013
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:45,520
expanded

3014
01:31:42,719 --> 01:31:46,880
yeah am i okay with humans dying no i

3015
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:49,679
don't want that to happen

3016
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,960
but if if if it does happen what if we

3017
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:52,319
we were sitting here and this is uh

3018
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:53,679
we're the last two people on earth we're

3019
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:56,000
saying lex we blew it

3020
01:31:53,679 --> 01:31:56,880
it's all over right yeah wouldn't i feel

3021
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,639
better if i

3022
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,079
knew that our knowledge was preserved

3023
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:01,840
and that we had agents

3024
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:04,158
represent that knew about that that were

3025
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:06,159
trans you know they were that left earth

3026
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:07,759
i would want that it's better than not

3027
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:09,198
having that you know i make the analogy

3028
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:10,639
of like you know the dinosaurs the poor

3029
01:32:09,198 --> 01:32:11,519
dinosaurs they live for you know tens of

3030
01:32:10,639 --> 01:32:13,199
millions of years

3031
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:14,960
they raised their kids they you know

3032
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:15,839
they they fought to survive they were

3033
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,239
hungry they

3034
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:19,279
they they did everything we do and then

3035
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:20,959
they're all gone

3036
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:23,119
yeah like you know and and if we didn't

3037
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:25,600
discover their bones

3038
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:26,800
nobody would ever know that they ever

3039
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:28,159
existed right

3040
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,400
do we want to be like that i don't want

3041
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:31,039
to be like that but there's a sad aspect

3042
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:33,679
to it and

3043
01:32:31,039 --> 01:32:34,079
it's kind of it's jarring to think about

3044
01:32:33,679 --> 01:32:37,119
that

3045
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:39,198
it's possible that a human-like

3046
01:32:37,119 --> 01:32:40,319
intelligent civilization has previously

3047
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:43,279
existed on earth

3048
01:32:40,319 --> 01:32:43,840
oh yeah the reason i say this is like it

3049
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:46,158
is

3050
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:47,920
jarring to think that we would not if

3051
01:32:46,158 --> 01:32:49,039
they weren't extinct we wouldn't be able

3052
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:51,440
to find evidence of them

3053
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:52,719
after a sufficient amount after a

3054
01:32:51,439 --> 01:32:54,879
sufficient amount of time

3055
01:32:52,719 --> 01:32:58,079
of course there's like look basically

3056
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:59,920
humans like if we destroy ourselves now

3057
01:32:58,079 --> 01:33:01,359
human civilization destroy ourselves now

3058
01:32:59,920 --> 01:33:02,158
after a sufficient amount of time we

3059
01:33:01,359 --> 01:33:04,479
would not be

3060
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:05,839
we'd find the evidence of the dinosaurs

3061
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:07,519
we would not find evidence

3062
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,840
of those humans yeah that's kind of an

3063
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:12,320
odd thing to think about although

3064
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:13,039
i'm not sure if we have enough knowledge

3065
01:33:12,319 --> 01:33:14,880
about

3066
01:33:13,039 --> 01:33:16,158
species going back for billions of years

3067
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,440
that we could we could

3068
01:33:16,158 --> 01:33:19,039
we might be able to eliminate that

3069
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:19,599
possibility but it's an interesting

3070
01:33:19,039 --> 01:33:21,519
question

3071
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:23,199
of course this is a similar question to

3072
01:33:21,520 --> 01:33:24,560
you know there were lots of intelligent

3073
01:33:23,198 --> 01:33:25,198
species throughout the without our

3074
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,280
galaxy

3075
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:28,238
that have all disappeared yeah that's

3076
01:33:27,279 --> 01:33:31,599
super sad that

3077
01:33:28,238 --> 01:33:33,359
um there exactly that

3078
01:33:31,600 --> 01:33:35,520
there may have been much more

3079
01:33:33,359 --> 01:33:36,000
intelligent alien civilizations in our

3080
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:38,800
galaxy

3081
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,719
that are no longer there yeah um you

3082
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:43,199
actually talked about this

3083
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:43,920
um that humans might destroy ourselves

3084
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:48,079
yeah

3085
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:51,920
and how we might preserve our knowledge

3086
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:55,920
yeah and advertise that knowledge

3087
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:57,600
to other advertisers a funny word to use

3088
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:00,079
from a pr person there's no financial

3089
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:00,079
gain in this

3090
01:34:00,158 --> 01:34:04,238
uh you know like make it like from a

3091
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:06,238
tourism perspective make it interesting

3092
01:34:04,238 --> 01:34:08,079
can you describe how well there's a

3093
01:34:06,238 --> 01:34:08,799
couple things i broke it down to the two

3094
01:34:08,079 --> 01:34:12,238
parts

3095
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:14,639
actually three parts one is um

3096
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,319
you know there's a lot of things we know

3097
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:17,039
that what if what if we were to what if

3098
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:19,119
we ended

3099
01:34:17,039 --> 01:34:20,960
up our civilization collapsed yeah i'm

3100
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:22,238
not talking tomorrow yeah we could be a

3101
01:34:20,960 --> 01:34:23,520
thousand years from now alex you know we

3102
01:34:22,238 --> 01:34:25,599
don't really know but

3103
01:34:23,520 --> 01:34:27,360
but historically would be likely at some

3104
01:34:25,600 --> 01:34:30,400
point time flies when you're having fun

3105
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:32,559
yeah that's a good way to put it um

3106
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:34,079
you know could we and then then

3107
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,120
intelligent life evolved again on this

3108
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:36,479
planet

3109
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:38,000
wouldn't they want to know a lot about

3110
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:38,879
us and what we knew when they wouldn't

3111
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,960
be able to ask us

3112
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:42,960
questions so one very simple thing i

3113
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:44,480
said how would we archive what we know

3114
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,079
that was a very simple idea i said you

3115
01:34:44,479 --> 01:34:46,959
know what that wouldn't be that hard but

3116
01:34:46,079 --> 01:34:48,319
a few satellites

3117
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:50,560
you know going around this the sun and

3118
01:34:48,319 --> 01:34:52,960
we upload wikipedia every day and

3119
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:54,560
um that kind of thing uh so you know we

3120
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:55,920
can end up killing ourselves well it's

3121
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:56,960
up there and the next intelligence piece

3122
01:34:55,920 --> 01:34:58,158
will find it and learn something that

3123
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,719
would be they would like that they would

3124
01:34:58,158 --> 01:35:00,719
appreciate that

3125
01:35:01,198 --> 01:35:04,559
so that's one thing the next thing i

3126
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:07,520
said well what if you know

3127
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:09,119
how to outside of our solar system we

3128
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:10,960
have the seti program we're looking for

3129
01:35:09,118 --> 01:35:12,799
these intelligent signals from everybody

3130
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:14,719
and if you do a little bit of math which

3131
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:15,679
i did in the book uh and you say well

3132
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:18,239
what if intelligent

3133
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:19,600
species only live for 10 000 years

3134
01:35:18,238 --> 01:35:21,279
before you know technologically

3135
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,079
intelligent species like ones are really

3136
01:35:21,279 --> 01:35:24,479
able to do this

3137
01:35:22,079 --> 01:35:25,840
we're just starting to be able to do um

3138
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:26,879
well the chances are we wouldn't be able

3139
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:28,000
to see any of them because they would

3140
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:30,239
have all been disappeared by

3141
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:32,079
now um they would they've lived for 10

3142
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:33,439
000 years and now they're gone

3143
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:35,039
and so we're not going to find these

3144
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:36,158
signals being sent from these people

3145
01:35:35,039 --> 01:35:37,679
because

3146
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:39,759
i said what kind of signal could you

3147
01:35:37,679 --> 01:35:41,118
create that would last a million years

3148
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,679
or a billion years

3149
01:35:41,118 --> 01:35:44,799
that someone would say damn it someone

3150
01:35:43,679 --> 01:35:46,079
smart lived there

3151
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:47,920
we know that that would be a

3152
01:35:46,079 --> 01:35:49,118
life-changing event for us to figure

3153
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:50,480
that out well what we're looking for

3154
01:35:49,118 --> 01:35:51,599
today in the study program isn't that

3155
01:35:50,479 --> 01:35:54,158
we're looking for very

3156
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:55,280
coded signals in some sense and so i

3157
01:35:54,158 --> 01:35:57,439
asked myself what would be a different

3158
01:35:55,279 --> 01:35:58,319
type of signal one could create

3159
01:35:57,439 --> 01:35:59,678
i've always thought about this

3160
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:00,479
throughout my life and in the book i

3161
01:35:59,679 --> 01:36:04,480
gave one

3162
01:36:00,479 --> 01:36:06,959
one possible suggestion which was um

3163
01:36:04,479 --> 01:36:08,319
we now detect planets going around other

3164
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:11,359
other suns

3165
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:12,238
other stars excuse me and we do that by

3166
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:13,679
seeing this the

3167
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:15,919
the slight dimming of the light as the

3168
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:18,399
planets move in front of them that's how

3169
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:19,520
we detect uh planets elsewhere in our

3170
01:36:18,399 --> 01:36:21,279
galaxy

3171
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:24,400
um what if we created something like

3172
01:36:21,279 --> 01:36:26,319
that that just rotated around our

3173
01:36:24,399 --> 01:36:27,679
around the sun and it blocked out a

3174
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:29,359
little bit of light in a particular

3175
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:32,000
pattern that someone said hey

3176
01:36:29,359 --> 01:36:33,679
that's not a planet that is a sign that

3177
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:35,520
someone was once there you can say

3178
01:36:33,679 --> 01:36:37,199
what if it's beating up pi you know

3179
01:36:35,520 --> 01:36:40,000
three point whatever

3180
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:41,279
um so the idea of a distance you can

3181
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:44,158
from a distance

3182
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:45,679
broadly broadcast takes no continue

3183
01:36:44,158 --> 01:36:46,000
activation on our part this is the key

3184
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:47,199
right

3185
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,039
no one has to be seen here running a

3186
01:36:47,198 --> 01:36:52,638
computer and supplying it with power

3187
01:36:49,039 --> 01:36:54,880
it just goes on so we go it's continues

3188
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:56,319
and and i argue that part of the study

3189
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,199
program should be looking for signals

3190
01:36:56,319 --> 01:36:58,559
like that

3191
01:36:57,198 --> 01:37:00,000
and to look for signals like that you

3192
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:01,119
ought to figure out what the how would

3193
01:37:00,000 --> 01:37:03,039
we create a signal

3194
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:04,639
like what would we create that would be

3195
01:37:03,039 --> 01:37:05,679
like that that would persist for

3196
01:37:04,639 --> 01:37:07,199
millions of years

3197
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:08,639
that would be broadcast broadly you

3198
01:37:07,198 --> 01:37:10,319
could see from a distance that was

3199
01:37:08,639 --> 01:37:13,279
unequivocal it came from an

3200
01:37:10,319 --> 01:37:14,559
uh by an intelligent species and so i

3201
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:15,599
gave that one example

3202
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:18,320
um because they don't know what i know

3203
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:21,440
of actually and then and then finally

3204
01:37:18,319 --> 01:37:23,679
right if if our

3205
01:37:21,439 --> 01:37:24,879
ultimately our solar system will die at

3206
01:37:23,679 --> 01:37:28,239
some point in time

3207
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,639
you know how do we go beyond that and i

3208
01:37:28,238 --> 01:37:30,559
think

3209
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:31,840
it's possible if at all possible we'll

3210
01:37:30,560 --> 01:37:33,600
have to create intelligent machines that

3211
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:35,119
travel throughout this throughout the

3212
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:37,039
the solar system or throughout the

3213
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:37,679
galaxy and i don't think that's going to

3214
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:38,319
be humans

3215
01:37:37,679 --> 01:37:40,719
i don't think it's going to be

3216
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:42,000
biological organisms so these are just

3217
01:37:40,719 --> 01:37:42,560
things to think about you know like

3218
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,000
what's the

3219
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:45,039
you know like i don't i don't want to be

3220
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:46,719
like the dinosaurs i don't want to just

3221
01:37:45,039 --> 01:37:47,600
live and okay that was it we're done you

3222
01:37:46,719 --> 01:37:49,039
know

3223
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:50,719
well there is a kind of presumption that

3224
01:37:49,039 --> 01:37:54,639
we're going to live forever which

3225
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:57,118
uh i i think it is a bit sad

3226
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:58,639
to imagine that the message we send as

3227
01:37:57,118 --> 01:38:01,679
as you talk about

3228
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:04,480
is that we were once here

3229
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:05,520
instead of we are here well it could be

3230
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:08,718
we are still here

3231
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:10,639
uh but it's more of a it's more of an

3232
01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:13,840
insurance policy in case we're not here

3233
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:15,359
you know well i don't know but there's

3234
01:38:13,840 --> 01:38:17,279
something

3235
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:19,839
i think about we as humans don't often

3236
01:38:17,279 --> 01:38:22,179
think about this but

3237
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,760
it's like like whenever i um

3238
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:25,840
[Music]

3239
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:27,440
record a video i've done this a couple

3240
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:29,600
times in my life i've recorded a video

3241
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,759
for my future self just for personal

3242
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:33,760
just for fun and it's always just

3243
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:37,440
fascinating

3244
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:40,639
to think about that preserving yourself

3245
01:38:37,439 --> 01:38:42,559
for future civilizations for me it was

3246
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:44,800
preserving myself for future

3247
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,320
me but that's a little that's a little

3248
01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,800
fun example

3249
01:38:46,319 --> 01:38:50,158
of archival these podcasts are are

3250
01:38:48,800 --> 01:38:53,360
preserving you and i

3251
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:55,039
in a way yeah for future uh hopefully

3252
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:57,439
well after we're gone but you don't

3253
01:38:55,039 --> 01:38:59,840
often we're sitting here talking about

3254
01:38:57,439 --> 01:38:59,839
this

3255
01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,479
you are not thinking about the fact that

3256
01:39:02,399 --> 01:39:07,198
you and i are going to die

3257
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:08,959
and there will be like 10 years after

3258
01:39:07,198 --> 01:39:11,039
somebody watching this

3259
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:12,480
and we're still alive you know in some

3260
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:14,079
sense i do

3261
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:16,479
i'm here because i want to talk about

3262
01:39:14,079 --> 01:39:19,039
ideas right and these ideas

3263
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:19,519
transcend me and they transcend this

3264
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:22,719
time

3265
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:25,440
in on our planet um

3266
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:26,560
we're talking here about ideas that

3267
01:39:25,439 --> 01:39:28,079
could be around a thousand years from

3268
01:39:26,560 --> 01:39:31,600
now or a million years from now

3269
01:39:28,079 --> 01:39:32,079
i when i wrote my book i had an audience

3270
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:34,320
of mine

3271
01:39:32,079 --> 01:39:35,118
and one of the clearest audiences was

3272
01:39:34,319 --> 01:39:37,679
aliens

3273
01:39:35,118 --> 01:39:38,719
no were people reading this 100 years

3274
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:40,399
from now yes

3275
01:39:38,719 --> 01:39:42,319
i said to myself how do i make this book

3276
01:39:40,399 --> 01:39:44,000
relevant to summer reading this 100

3277
01:39:42,319 --> 01:39:46,158
years from now what would they want to

3278
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,039
know that we were thinking back then

3279
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:48,879
what would make it

3280
01:39:47,039 --> 01:39:50,238
like that was an interesting it's still

3281
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,239
an interesting book

3282
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:54,479
i'm not sure i can achieve that but that

3283
01:39:52,238 --> 01:39:56,319
was how i thought about it because these

3284
01:39:54,479 --> 01:39:57,439
ideas like especially in the third part

3285
01:39:56,319 --> 01:39:58,158
of the book the ones we're just talking

3286
01:39:57,439 --> 01:39:59,439
about

3287
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,960
you know these crazy it sounds like

3288
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:02,000
crazy ideas about you know storing our

3289
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,439
knowledge and

3290
01:40:02,000 --> 01:40:05,039
and you know merging our brains of

3291
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:06,879
computers and sending

3292
01:40:05,039 --> 01:40:08,880
you know our machine down to space is

3293
01:40:06,880 --> 01:40:11,279
not going to happen in my lifetime

3294
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:12,880
um and they may not have been happening

3295
01:40:11,279 --> 01:40:14,639
the next 100 years it may not happen for

3296
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:17,359
a thousand years who knows

3297
01:40:14,639 --> 01:40:18,239
uh but we have the unique opportunity

3298
01:40:17,359 --> 01:40:21,118
right now

3299
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:21,519
we you me and other people like this um

3300
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:24,719
to

3301
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:26,800
sort of at least propose the agenda

3302
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:28,800
um that might impact the future like

3303
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:32,159
that that's a fascinating way to think

3304
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:35,440
uh both like writing or creating

3305
01:40:32,158 --> 01:40:38,559
try to make try to create ideas

3306
01:40:35,439 --> 01:40:39,519
try to create things that uh hold up in

3307
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,960
time yeah

3308
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:42,639
you know understanding how the brain

3309
01:40:40,960 --> 01:40:44,560
works we're gonna figure that at once

3310
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:45,760
that's it it's gonna be figured out once

3311
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:47,520
and after that

3312
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:48,800
that's the answer and people will people

3313
01:40:47,520 --> 01:40:51,119
will study that

3314
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:53,679
thousands of years now we still we still

3315
01:40:51,118 --> 01:40:57,118
you know venerate newton and einstein

3316
01:40:53,679 --> 01:41:00,079
and um and you know because

3317
01:40:57,118 --> 01:41:01,439
because ideas are exciting even well

3318
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:02,880
into the future

3319
01:41:01,439 --> 01:41:05,519
well the interesting thing is like big

3320
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:09,440
ideas even if they're wrong

3321
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,800
are still useful like

3322
01:41:09,439 --> 01:41:12,559
yeah especially if they're not

3323
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:14,320
completely wrong like

3324
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:16,840
right newton's laws are not wrong

3325
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:19,039
they're just einsteins they're

3326
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:20,560
better um well it's

3327
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:21,840
so yeah i mean but we're talking with

3328
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,880
newton and einstein we're talking about

3329
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:24,319
physics i wonder

3330
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:27,279
if we'll ever achieve that kind of

3331
01:41:24,319 --> 01:41:30,319
clarity but understanding um

3332
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:32,158
like complex systems and the this

3333
01:41:30,319 --> 01:41:33,279
particular manifestation of complex

3334
01:41:32,158 --> 01:41:35,920
systems which is the

3335
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:36,719
human brain i'm totally optimistic we

3336
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,880
can do that i mean

3337
01:41:36,719 --> 01:41:40,158
we're making progress at it i don't see

3338
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:42,239
any reasons why we can't

3339
01:41:40,158 --> 01:41:43,679
completely i mean completely understand

3340
01:41:42,238 --> 01:41:44,959
in the sense um

3341
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:46,719
you know we don't really completely

3342
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,000
understand what all the molecules in

3343
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:49,679
this water bottle are doing

3344
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:51,679
but you know we have laws that sort of

3345
01:41:49,679 --> 01:41:53,520
capture it pretty good um

3346
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:54,880
and uh so we'll have that kind of

3347
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:56,080
understanding i mean it's not like

3348
01:41:54,880 --> 01:41:58,880
you're gonna have to know what every

3349
01:41:56,079 --> 01:42:00,399
neuron in your brain is doing um but

3350
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:02,880
enough to uh

3351
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:04,158
first of all to build it and second of

3352
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,079
all to do you know

3353
01:42:04,158 --> 01:42:08,479
do what physics does which is like have

3354
01:42:06,079 --> 01:42:11,198
uh concrete experiments where we can

3355
01:42:08,479 --> 01:42:12,000
validate we're we're this is happening

3356
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:14,319
right now like

3357
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:15,039
it's not this is not some future thing

3358
01:42:14,319 --> 01:42:16,479
um

3359
01:42:15,039 --> 01:42:18,319
you know i'm very optimistic about

3360
01:42:16,479 --> 01:42:19,279
because i know about art our work and

3361
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:24,399
what we're doing

3362
01:42:19,279 --> 01:42:24,399
i have to prove it to people um but um

3363
01:42:24,479 --> 01:42:28,000
i i consider myself a rational person

3364
01:42:27,359 --> 01:42:30,719
and

3365
01:42:28,000 --> 01:42:32,000
um you know until fairly recently i

3366
01:42:30,719 --> 01:42:33,279
wouldn't have said that but right now

3367
01:42:32,000 --> 01:42:34,880
i'm where i'm sitting right now i'm

3368
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:35,439
saying you know we can this is going to

3369
01:42:34,880 --> 01:42:38,480
happen

3370
01:42:35,439 --> 01:42:39,759
there's no big obstacles to it um

3371
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:40,799
we finally have a framework for

3372
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:42,159
understanding what's going on in the

3373
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,440
cortex and

3374
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:46,879
um and that's liberating it's it's like

3375
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:48,960
oh it's happening

3376
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:50,880
so i i can't see why we wouldn't be able

3377
01:42:48,960 --> 01:42:53,118
to understand it i just can't

3378
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:56,000
okay oh so i mean on that topic let me

3379
01:42:53,118 --> 01:42:59,359
ask you to play devil's advocate

3380
01:42:56,000 --> 01:43:02,319
is it possible for you to imagine

3381
01:42:59,359 --> 01:43:04,399
luck look a hundred years from now and

3382
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:08,238
looking at your book

3383
01:43:04,399 --> 01:43:10,638
uh in which ways might your ideas be

3384
01:43:08,238 --> 01:43:12,959
wrong oh i worry about this all the time

3385
01:43:10,639 --> 01:43:12,960
um

3386
01:43:13,359 --> 01:43:18,319
yeah it's still useful yeah yeah

3387
01:43:18,960 --> 01:43:24,079
i think there's you know um well

3388
01:43:22,238 --> 01:43:26,319
i can i can best relate it to like

3389
01:43:24,079 --> 01:43:28,479
things i'm worried about right now

3390
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:29,920
so we talk about this voting idea right

3391
01:43:28,479 --> 01:43:30,638
it's happening there's no question

3392
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,149
that's happening

3393
01:43:30,639 --> 01:43:34,239
but it could be far more

3394
01:43:32,149 --> 01:43:35,920
[Music]

3395
01:43:34,238 --> 01:43:38,718
there's there's enough things i don't

3396
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:40,158
know about it that it might be

3397
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:41,840
working in ways differently i'm thinking

3398
01:43:40,158 --> 01:43:42,559
about the kind of what's voting who's

3399
01:43:41,840 --> 01:43:44,239
voting

3400
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,679
you know where are representations i

3401
01:43:44,238 --> 01:43:46,718
talked about you have a thousand models

3402
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:48,800
of a coffee cup

3403
01:43:46,719 --> 01:43:49,840
like that that could turn out to be

3404
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,320
wrong

3405
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:52,880
because it may be maybe there are a

3406
01:43:52,319 --> 01:43:54,399
thousand

3407
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,159
models that are sub models but not

3408
01:43:54,399 --> 01:43:58,559
really a single model the coffee cup

3409
01:43:56,158 --> 01:44:00,479
um i mean there's things these are all

3410
01:43:58,560 --> 01:44:02,320
sort of on the edges

3411
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:04,000
things that i i present as like oh it's

3412
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:06,000
so simple and clean well it's not that

3413
01:44:04,000 --> 01:44:09,198
it's always going to be more complex

3414
01:44:06,000 --> 01:44:11,118
and um and there's

3415
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:13,039
parts of the theory which i don't

3416
01:44:11,118 --> 01:44:16,238
understand the complexity well

3417
01:44:13,039 --> 01:44:17,679
so i think i think the idea is brain is

3418
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:19,599
a distributed modeling system is

3419
01:44:17,679 --> 01:44:21,118
not controversial at all right that's

3420
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,679
not that's well understood by many

3421
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:23,519
people

3422
01:44:21,679 --> 01:44:25,359
the question then is are each quarter of

3423
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:29,760
a column an independent modeling system

3424
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:32,799
right um i could be wrong about that

3425
01:44:29,760 --> 01:44:35,440
um i don't think so but i worry about it

3426
01:44:32,800 --> 01:44:36,480
my intuition not even thinking why you

3427
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:38,559
could be wrong

3428
01:44:36,479 --> 01:44:40,479
is the same intuition i have about any

3429
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:43,920
sort of physicist

3430
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:46,479
like strength theory that we as humans

3431
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:49,760
desire for a clean explanation

3432
01:44:46,479 --> 01:44:51,839
and uh 100 years from now

3433
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:53,119
uh intelligent systems might look back

3434
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:55,520
at us and

3435
01:44:53,118 --> 01:44:56,639
laugh at how we try to get rid of the

3436
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:58,639
whole mess

3437
01:44:56,639 --> 01:45:00,239
by having simple explanation when the

3438
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:03,039
reality is it's

3439
01:45:00,238 --> 01:45:04,959
it's way messier and in fact it's

3440
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:06,800
impossible to understand you can only

3441
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:07,760
build it it's like this idea of complex

3442
01:45:06,800 --> 01:45:09,679
systems and

3443
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,360
cellular automata yeah you can only

3444
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:11,760
launch the thing you cannot understand

3445
01:45:11,359 --> 01:45:14,238
it

3446
01:45:11,760 --> 01:45:15,520
yeah i think that you know the history

3447
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:18,638
of science suggests that's

3448
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,840
not likely to occur the history of

3449
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:22,159
science suggests that

3450
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:24,800
look as a theorist and we're theorists

3451
01:45:22,158 --> 01:45:26,879
you look for simple explanations right

3452
01:45:24,800 --> 01:45:28,719
fully knowing that whatever simple

3453
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,719
explanation you're going to come up with

3454
01:45:28,719 --> 01:45:31,840
is not going to be completely correct i

3455
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,118
mean it can't be

3456
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,360
i mean it's just it's just more

3457
01:45:33,118 --> 01:45:37,359
complexity but that's the role of

3458
01:45:35,359 --> 01:45:39,039
theorists play they they sort of they

3459
01:45:37,359 --> 01:45:40,880
give you a framework

3460
01:45:39,039 --> 01:45:42,319
on which you now can talk about a

3461
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,840
problem and figure out

3462
01:45:42,319 --> 01:45:46,319
okay now we can start dig in more

3463
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:48,159
details the best frameworks stick around

3464
01:45:46,319 --> 01:45:51,679
while the details change

3465
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:53,439
you know again you know the classic

3466
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:54,639
example is newton and einstein right you

3467
01:45:53,439 --> 01:45:57,919
know

3468
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:58,560
um newton's theories are still used

3469
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:00,079
they're still

3470
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,080
valuable they're still practical they're

3471
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:03,279
not like wrong it's just they've been

3472
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:05,840
refined yeah but that's

3473
01:46:03,279 --> 01:46:07,679
in physics it's not obvious by the way

3474
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:09,600
it's not obvious for physics either

3475
01:46:07,679 --> 01:46:11,359
that the universe should be such that

3476
01:46:09,600 --> 01:46:14,400
it's amenable to these

3477
01:46:11,359 --> 01:46:16,000
simple but so far it appears to be as

3478
01:46:14,399 --> 01:46:19,359
far as we can tell

3479
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:19,679
um yeah i mean but as far as we could

3480
01:46:19,359 --> 01:46:21,359
tell

3481
01:46:19,679 --> 01:46:23,600
and but it's also an open question

3482
01:46:21,359 --> 01:46:25,839
whether the brain is amenable to such

3483
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:27,199
clean theories that's the uh not the

3484
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:29,119
brain but intelligence

3485
01:46:27,198 --> 01:46:31,359
well i i i don't know i would take

3486
01:46:29,118 --> 01:46:35,118
intelligence out of it just say you know

3487
01:46:31,359 --> 01:46:37,279
um well okay

3488
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:38,839
um the evidence we have suggests that

3489
01:46:37,279 --> 01:46:41,840
the human brain

3490
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:43,679
is a at the one time extremely messy and

3491
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:45,440
complex but there's some parts that are

3492
01:46:43,679 --> 01:46:47,118
very regular and structured

3493
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:49,678
that's why we started the neocortex it's

3494
01:46:47,118 --> 01:46:51,920
extremely regular in its structure

3495
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:53,520
yeah and unbelievably so and then i

3496
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:56,880
mentioned earlier the other thing is

3497
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:59,760
it's it's universal abilities it is so

3498
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:00,239
flexible to learn so many things we

3499
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:01,360
don't

3500
01:47:00,238 --> 01:47:02,799
we haven't figured out what it can't

3501
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:04,238
learn yet we don't know but we haven't

3502
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:06,000
figured out yet but to learn things that

3503
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:09,118
it never was evolved to learn

3504
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:10,560
so those give us hope um that's why i

3505
01:47:09,118 --> 01:47:11,439
went into this field because i said you

3506
01:47:10,560 --> 01:47:14,560
know

3507
01:47:11,439 --> 01:47:16,000
this regular structure it's doing this

3508
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,600
amazing number of things there's got to

3509
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:19,920
be some underlying principles that are

3510
01:47:17,600 --> 01:47:21,039
that are common and other other

3511
01:47:19,920 --> 01:47:22,239
scientists have come up with the same

3512
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:25,279
conclusions

3513
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:28,000
um and so it's promising it's promising

3514
01:47:25,279 --> 01:47:28,719
and um and that's and whether the

3515
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:31,840
theories

3516
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:33,920
play out exactly this way or not that is

3517
01:47:31,840 --> 01:47:35,840
the role that theorists play

3518
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:37,279
and so far it's worked out well even

3519
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:38,639
though you know maybe

3520
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:40,639
you know we don't understand all the

3521
01:47:38,639 --> 01:47:42,560
laws of physics but so far it's been

3522
01:47:40,639 --> 01:47:45,520
pretty damn useful the ones we have

3523
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,320
are our theories are pretty bit useful

3524
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:49,920
you mentioned

3525
01:47:46,319 --> 01:47:51,599
that uh we should not necessarily be at

3526
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:53,359
least to the degree that we are

3527
01:47:51,600 --> 01:47:55,199
worried about the existential risks of

3528
01:47:53,359 --> 01:47:58,319
artificial intelligence

3529
01:47:55,198 --> 01:48:01,198
relative to uh human

3530
01:47:58,319 --> 01:48:02,719
risks from human nature being

3531
01:48:01,198 --> 01:48:04,638
existential risk

3532
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:06,800
what aspect of human nature worries you

3533
01:48:04,639 --> 01:48:09,600
the most in terms of the survival of the

3534
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:09,600
human species

3535
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:14,960
i mean i'm disappointed in humanity as

3536
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:17,840
humans i mean all of us i'm one so i'm

3537
01:48:14,960 --> 01:48:20,800
at disappointed myself too

3538
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:22,719
it's kind of a sad state there's two

3539
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:26,639
things that disappoint me

3540
01:48:22,719 --> 01:48:28,000
one is how it's difficult for us to

3541
01:48:26,639 --> 01:48:30,000
separate our rational

3542
01:48:28,000 --> 01:48:31,760
component of ourselves from our

3543
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:36,639
evolutionary heritage which is

3544
01:48:31,760 --> 01:48:36,639
you know not always pretty you know

3545
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:40,079
rape is a is an evolutionary good

3546
01:48:39,039 --> 01:48:42,560
strategy

3547
01:48:40,079 --> 01:48:43,279
for reproduction murder can be at times

3548
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:45,760
too

3549
01:48:43,279 --> 01:48:46,319
you know making other people miserable

3550
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:48,480
at times

3551
01:48:46,319 --> 01:48:49,920
is a good strategy for reproduction it's

3552
01:48:48,479 --> 01:48:52,559
just and it's just and

3553
01:48:49,920 --> 01:48:53,840
and so now that we know that and yet we

3554
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:55,039
have this sort of you know we and i can

3555
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,000
have this very rational discussion

3556
01:48:55,039 --> 01:48:57,519
talking about you know

3557
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:59,359
intelligence and brains and life and so

3558
01:48:57,520 --> 01:49:01,360
on so

3559
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:02,799
it seems like it's so hard it's just a

3560
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:05,519
big transition to get

3561
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:06,960
humans all humans to to to make the

3562
01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:09,600
transition from be like let's

3563
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,480
pay no attention to all that ugly stuff

3564
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:12,719
over here

3565
01:49:10,479 --> 01:49:14,399
let's just focus on the instances what's

3566
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:15,198
unique about humanity is our knowledge

3567
01:49:14,399 --> 01:49:17,118
and our

3568
01:49:15,198 --> 01:49:19,678
intellect but the fact that we're

3569
01:49:17,118 --> 01:49:21,759
striving is in itself amazing right

3570
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:22,800
the fact that we're able to overcome

3571
01:49:21,760 --> 01:49:26,400
that part and

3572
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:28,320
it seems like we are more and more

3573
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:29,839
becoming successful and overcoming that

3574
01:49:28,319 --> 01:49:30,238
that is the optimistic view and i agree

3575
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,119
with you

3576
01:49:30,238 --> 01:49:34,319
yeah but i worry about it i'm not saying

3577
01:49:33,118 --> 01:49:35,679
i'm worrying about i think maybe that

3578
01:49:34,319 --> 01:49:36,238
was your question i still worry about it

3579
01:49:35,679 --> 01:49:38,079
yes

3580
01:49:36,238 --> 01:49:39,439
um you know we could be end tomorrow

3581
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:41,359
because some terrorists could get

3582
01:49:39,439 --> 01:49:42,000
nuclear bombs and you know blow us all

3583
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:44,000
up who knows

3584
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:45,039
right the other thing i think i'm

3585
01:49:44,000 --> 01:49:47,198
disappointed is

3586
01:49:45,039 --> 01:49:48,399
uh and it's just i understand it it's i

3587
01:49:47,198 --> 01:49:49,678
guess you can't really be disappointed

3588
01:49:48,399 --> 01:49:52,319
it's just a fact

3589
01:49:49,679 --> 01:49:54,079
is that we're so prone to false beliefs

3590
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:55,359
that we you know we have a model in our

3591
01:49:54,079 --> 01:49:57,840
head

3592
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:59,279
the things we can interact with directly

3593
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:01,679
physical objects

3594
01:49:59,279 --> 01:50:03,279
people that model is pretty good and we

3595
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:04,800
can test it all the time

3596
01:50:03,279 --> 01:50:06,719
right i touch something i look at it i

3597
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:08,719
talk to you see my model's correct

3598
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:09,840
but so much of what we know is stuff i

3599
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:11,118
can't directly

3600
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:12,800
interact with i can't i don't know

3601
01:50:11,118 --> 01:50:13,598
because someone told me about it yeah

3602
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,800
and so

3603
01:50:13,599 --> 01:50:17,520
so we're prone inherently prone to

3604
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:19,199
having

3605
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:20,320
false beliefs because if i'm told

3606
01:50:19,198 --> 01:50:21,919
something how am i going to know it's

3607
01:50:20,319 --> 01:50:23,599
right or wrong right

3608
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,039
and so then we have the scientific

3609
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:27,679
process which says

3610
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:28,880
we are inherently flawed so the only way

3611
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:30,960
we can

3612
01:50:28,880 --> 01:50:32,800
get closer to the truth is by looking

3613
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:36,639
for

3614
01:50:32,800 --> 01:50:39,760
um contrary evidence yeah um like this

3615
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:41,279
uh conspiracy theory this this theory

3616
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:42,960
that scientists keep telling me about

3617
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:45,920
that the earth is round

3618
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,039
uh as far as i can tell when i look out

3619
01:50:45,920 --> 01:50:49,599
it looks pretty flat

3620
01:50:47,039 --> 01:50:52,800
yeah so yeah there is there's a tension

3621
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:55,119
but it's also um

3622
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:56,719
um i tend to believe that we haven't

3623
01:50:55,118 --> 01:51:00,399
figured out most of this thing

3624
01:50:56,719 --> 01:51:01,279
right most of nature around us is a

3625
01:51:00,399 --> 01:51:03,039
mystery

3626
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:05,039
and so it um but that doesn't work does

3627
01:51:03,039 --> 01:51:06,319
that worry you i mean it's like oh

3628
01:51:05,039 --> 01:51:06,960
that's that's like a pleasure more to

3629
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:09,279
figure out

3630
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:11,118
right yeah that's exciting but i'm

3631
01:51:09,279 --> 01:51:14,079
saying like there's going to be a lot of

3632
01:51:11,118 --> 01:51:14,960
quote unquote wrong ideas i mean i've

3633
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:17,599
been

3634
01:51:14,960 --> 01:51:19,279
thinking a lot about engineering systems

3635
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:21,840
like social networks and so on

3636
01:51:19,279 --> 01:51:22,960
and i've been worried about censorship

3637
01:51:21,840 --> 01:51:24,719
and thinking through all that kind of

3638
01:51:22,960 --> 01:51:27,840
stuff because there's a lot of wrong

3639
01:51:24,719 --> 01:51:30,960
ideas there's a lot of dangerous ideas

3640
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:33,360
but then i also read a history

3641
01:51:30,960 --> 01:51:34,960
read history and see when you censor

3642
01:51:33,359 --> 01:51:37,359
ideas that are wrong

3643
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:38,239
now this could be a small-scale

3644
01:51:37,359 --> 01:51:40,719
censorship

3645
01:51:38,238 --> 01:51:42,559
like a young grad student who comes up

3646
01:51:40,719 --> 01:51:43,760
who like raises their hand and says some

3647
01:51:42,560 --> 01:51:46,560
crazy idea

3648
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:48,079
yes a form of censorship could be i

3649
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:50,000
shouldn't use the word censorship but

3650
01:51:48,079 --> 01:51:52,238
i think you may uh just like like

3651
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,118
de-incentivize them from no no no this

3652
01:51:52,238 --> 01:51:54,638
is the way it's been

3653
01:51:53,118 --> 01:51:56,399
yeah yeah you're you're a foolish kid

3654
01:51:54,639 --> 01:51:59,760
don't do it yeah yeah yeah foolish uh

3655
01:51:56,399 --> 01:52:02,799
so in some sense uh

3656
01:51:59,760 --> 01:52:03,840
those wrong ideas most of the time end

3657
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,719
up being

3658
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:08,239
wrong but sometimes i agree with you so

3659
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:12,239
i don't like the word censorship

3660
01:52:08,238 --> 01:52:15,439
um at the very end of the book i i

3661
01:52:12,238 --> 01:52:18,479
ended up with a sort of a a plea or a

3662
01:52:15,439 --> 01:52:21,439
recommended course of action and

3663
01:52:18,479 --> 01:52:23,439
the best way i could i know how to deal

3664
01:52:21,439 --> 01:52:26,238
with this issue that you bring up

3665
01:52:23,439 --> 01:52:26,638
is if everybody understood as part of

3666
01:52:26,238 --> 01:52:28,879
your

3667
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:29,679
upbringing in life something about how

3668
01:52:28,880 --> 01:52:32,719
your brain works

3669
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:33,920
that it builds a model of the world uh

3670
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:35,679
how it works you know how basically

3671
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:36,480
builds that model the world and that the

3672
01:52:35,679 --> 01:52:38,880
model

3673
01:52:36,479 --> 01:52:40,319
is not the real world it's just a model

3674
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:42,079
and it's never going to reflect the

3675
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:42,559
entire world and it can be wrong and

3676
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:44,559
it's

3677
01:52:42,560 --> 01:52:46,320
easy to be wrong and here's all the ways

3678
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:49,599
you can get the wrong model in your head

3679
01:52:46,319 --> 01:52:50,158
right it's not prescribed what's right

3680
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:52,560
or wrong

3681
01:52:50,158 --> 01:52:53,598
just understand that process if we all

3682
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,039
understood the process

3683
01:52:53,599 --> 01:52:56,560
then i got together and you say i

3684
01:52:55,039 --> 01:52:58,000
disagree with you jeff and i said lex i

3685
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:00,480
disagree with you that

3686
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:02,079
at least we understand that we're both

3687
01:53:00,479 --> 01:53:03,678
trying to model something

3688
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:05,118
we both have different information which

3689
01:53:03,679 --> 01:53:06,079
leads to our different models

3690
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:07,198
and therefore i shouldn't hold it

3691
01:53:06,079 --> 01:53:08,158
against you and you shouldn't hold it

3692
01:53:07,198 --> 01:53:10,158
against me

3693
01:53:08,158 --> 01:53:11,598
and we can at least agree that well what

3694
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:13,279
can we look for in in

3695
01:53:11,599 --> 01:53:15,520
its common ground to test our our

3696
01:53:13,279 --> 01:53:18,639
beliefs as opposed to so much

3697
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:20,560
uh as our we raise our kids on dogma

3698
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:22,319
which is this is a fact and this is a

3699
01:53:20,560 --> 01:53:25,920
fact and these people are bad

3700
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:26,719
and and you know where ever if everyone

3701
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:30,560
knew just

3702
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:32,399
to to be skeptical of every belief

3703
01:53:30,560 --> 01:53:34,960
and why and how their brains do that i

3704
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:38,000
think we might have a better world

3705
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:39,039
do you think the human mind is able to

3706
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:42,880
comprehend

3707
01:53:39,039 --> 01:53:44,560
reality so you talk about sort of this

3708
01:53:42,880 --> 01:53:47,118
creating models that are better and

3709
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:50,320
better how close do you think we get to

3710
01:53:47,118 --> 01:53:52,079
uh to reality there's so the wildest

3711
01:53:50,319 --> 01:53:54,319
ideas is like donald hoffman saying

3712
01:53:52,079 --> 01:53:55,920
we're very far away from reality

3713
01:53:54,319 --> 01:53:58,238
uh do you think we're getting close to

3714
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:59,920
reality well i guess it depends on what

3715
01:53:58,238 --> 01:54:01,678
you define reality

3716
01:53:59,920 --> 01:54:04,000
uh we are getting we have a model of the

3717
01:54:01,679 --> 01:54:07,039
world that's very useful

3718
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:07,439
right for basic well for our survival

3719
01:54:07,039 --> 01:54:10,800
and

3720
01:54:07,439 --> 01:54:13,678
our the pleasure whatever right

3721
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:15,119
um so that's useful um i mean it's

3722
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:16,158
really useful oh we can build planes we

3723
01:54:15,118 --> 01:54:17,279
can build computers we can do these

3724
01:54:16,158 --> 01:54:20,479
things right

3725
01:54:17,279 --> 01:54:23,039
uh i don't think i i don't know the

3726
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:24,399
answer to that question um

3727
01:54:23,039 --> 01:54:26,319
i think that's part of the question

3728
01:54:24,399 --> 01:54:27,598
we're trying to figure out right like

3729
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:29,920
you know obviously if you end up with a

3730
01:54:27,599 --> 01:54:31,599
theory of everything that

3731
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,960
really is a theory of everything and all

3732
01:54:31,599 --> 01:54:34,880
of a sudden everything comes into play

3733
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:36,079
and there's no room for something else

3734
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:37,920
then you might feel like we have a good

3735
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:39,840
model of the world yeah but we if we

3736
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:41,440
have a theory of everything and somehow

3737
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:43,039
first of all you'll never be able to

3738
01:54:41,439 --> 01:54:44,479
really conclusively say it's a theory of

3739
01:54:43,039 --> 01:54:46,639
everything but say somehow

3740
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:48,238
we are very damn sure it's the theory of

3741
01:54:46,639 --> 01:54:50,480
everything we understand

3742
01:54:48,238 --> 01:54:52,079
what happened at the big bang and how

3743
01:54:50,479 --> 01:54:53,759
just the entirety of the physical

3744
01:54:52,079 --> 01:54:58,238
process i'm still not sure that

3745
01:54:53,760 --> 01:55:01,360
gives us an understanding of uh the next

3746
01:54:58,238 --> 01:55:03,039
many layers of the hierarchy yeah

3747
01:55:01,359 --> 01:55:04,960
abstractions that form well also what if

3748
01:55:03,039 --> 01:55:08,158
string theory turns out to be true

3749
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:09,520
and then you say well we have no reality

3750
01:55:08,158 --> 01:55:11,039
no modeling what's going on in those

3751
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:11,920
other dimensions that are wrapped into

3752
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:15,039
it on each other

3753
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:15,440
you're right or or the multiverse you

3754
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:18,719
know

3755
01:55:15,439 --> 01:55:20,399
i i honestly don't know how for us

3756
01:55:18,719 --> 01:55:22,480
for human interaction for ideas of

3757
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:24,319
intelligence how it helps us to

3758
01:55:22,479 --> 01:55:26,799
understand that we're made up of

3759
01:55:24,319 --> 01:55:28,960
vibrating strings that are

3760
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:29,840
like tend to the whatever times smaller

3761
01:55:28,960 --> 01:55:32,480
than us

3762
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:34,239
yeah i don't you know you could probably

3763
01:55:32,479 --> 01:55:35,759
build better weapons and better rockets

3764
01:55:34,238 --> 01:55:37,598
but you're not going to be able to

3765
01:55:35,760 --> 01:55:39,199
understand intelligence i guess i guess

3766
01:55:37,599 --> 01:55:39,440
maybe better computers no you won't be

3767
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:41,678
able

3768
01:55:39,439 --> 01:55:42,960
i think it's just more purely knowledge

3769
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:44,800
you might lead to a better

3770
01:55:42,960 --> 01:55:46,239
understanding of the of the beginning of

3771
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:47,520
the universe

3772
01:55:46,238 --> 01:55:50,000
right it might lead to a better

3773
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:52,080
understanding of uh

3774
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:53,760
i don't know i guess i think the

3775
01:55:52,079 --> 01:55:55,039
acquisition of knowledge has always been

3776
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:59,199
one where

3777
01:55:55,039 --> 01:56:02,399
you you pursue it for its own pleasure

3778
01:55:59,198 --> 01:56:03,279
um and you don't always know what is

3779
01:56:02,399 --> 01:56:06,399
going to make a difference

3780
01:56:03,279 --> 01:56:07,679
yeah you're pleasantly surprised by the

3781
01:56:06,399 --> 01:56:10,158
the weird things you find

3782
01:56:07,679 --> 01:56:11,760
do you think uh for the for the

3783
01:56:10,158 --> 01:56:13,198
neocortex in general

3784
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:15,119
do you think there's a lot of innovation

3785
01:56:13,198 --> 01:56:18,158
to be done on the machine

3786
01:56:15,118 --> 01:56:18,799
side you know you use the computer as a

3787
01:56:18,158 --> 01:56:20,719
metaphor

3788
01:56:18,800 --> 01:56:22,480
quite a bit is there a different types

3789
01:56:20,719 --> 01:56:23,599
of computer that would help us build i

3790
01:56:22,479 --> 01:56:25,279
mean what are the intelligences like the

3791
01:56:23,599 --> 01:56:27,279
manifestations of intelligent machines

3792
01:56:25,279 --> 01:56:28,319
yeah or is it oh no it's going to be

3793
01:56:27,279 --> 01:56:31,118
totally

3794
01:56:28,319 --> 01:56:32,479
crazy uh we have no idea how this is

3795
01:56:31,118 --> 01:56:35,439
going to look out yet

3796
01:56:32,479 --> 01:56:37,359
but you can already see this today we of

3797
01:56:35,439 --> 01:56:40,319
course remodel these things on

3798
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:41,519
traditional computers and now now gpus

3799
01:56:40,319 --> 01:56:44,479
are really popular with

3800
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:44,960
with you know neural networks and so on

3801
01:56:44,479 --> 01:56:46,399
um

3802
01:56:44,960 --> 01:56:50,399
but there are companies coming up with

3803
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:52,000
fundamentally new physical substrates

3804
01:56:50,399 --> 01:56:54,238
that are just really cool i don't know

3805
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,639
if they're going to work or not

3806
01:56:54,238 --> 01:56:57,439
but i think there'll be decades of

3807
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:59,599
innovation here

3808
01:56:57,439 --> 01:57:00,719
yeah totally do you think the final

3809
01:56:59,599 --> 01:57:03,599
thing will

3810
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:04,079
be messy like our biology is messy or do

3811
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:06,960
you think

3812
01:57:04,079 --> 01:57:08,559
um it's it's the it's the old bird

3813
01:57:06,960 --> 01:57:12,079
versus airplane question

3814
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:15,280
or do you think we could just uh

3815
01:57:12,079 --> 01:57:17,039
build airplanes yeah that

3816
01:57:15,279 --> 01:57:18,559
that fly way better than birds in the

3817
01:57:17,039 --> 01:57:21,679
same way we can build

3818
01:57:18,560 --> 01:57:24,400
uh uh electrical and

3819
01:57:21,679 --> 01:57:25,679
yeah yeah you know can i can i can i

3820
01:57:24,399 --> 01:57:27,039
refund the bird thing a bit because i

3821
01:57:25,679 --> 01:57:29,039
think it's interesting

3822
01:57:27,039 --> 01:57:30,479
people ability misunderstand this the

3823
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:33,599
wright brothers

3824
01:57:30,479 --> 01:57:34,799
um the problem they were trying to solve

3825
01:57:33,599 --> 01:57:37,119
was controlled flight

3826
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:38,400
how to turn an airplane not how to

3827
01:57:37,118 --> 01:57:39,198
propel an airplane

3828
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:40,799
they weren't worried about that

3829
01:57:39,198 --> 01:57:41,598
interesting yeah they already had at

3830
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:43,279
that time

3831
01:57:41,599 --> 01:57:44,719
there was already wing shapes which they

3832
01:57:43,279 --> 01:57:46,639
had from studying birds there was

3833
01:57:44,719 --> 01:57:48,000
already gliders that carry people

3834
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:49,599
the problem is if you put a rudder on

3835
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,279
the back of a glider and you turn it the

3836
01:57:49,599 --> 01:57:53,279
plane falls out of the sky

3837
01:57:51,279 --> 01:57:55,039
so the problem was how do you control

3838
01:57:53,279 --> 01:57:57,359
flight and

3839
01:57:55,039 --> 01:57:58,960
they studied birds and they actually had

3840
01:57:57,359 --> 01:57:59,679
birds in captivity they watched birds in

3841
01:57:58,960 --> 01:58:01,039
wind tunnels

3842
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:03,039
they observed in the wild and they

3843
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:04,238
discovered the secret was the birds

3844
01:58:03,039 --> 01:58:05,920
twist their wings

3845
01:58:04,238 --> 01:58:07,039
when they turn and so that's what they

3846
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,440
did on the wright brothers flyer they

3847
01:58:07,039 --> 01:58:09,118
had these

3848
01:58:07,439 --> 01:58:10,879
sticks you would twist the wing and that

3849
01:58:09,118 --> 01:58:13,759
was that was their innovation

3850
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:15,440
not their propeller and today airplanes

3851
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:17,119
still twist their wings we don't twist

3852
01:58:15,439 --> 01:58:18,000
the entire wing we just just the tail

3853
01:58:17,118 --> 01:58:20,079
end of it

3854
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:22,000
the the the flaps which is the same

3855
01:58:20,079 --> 01:58:23,118
thing so today's airplanes fly on the

3856
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:24,800
same principles as

3857
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:26,158
birds which is observed by so everyone

3858
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:28,560
get that analogy wrong

3859
01:58:26,158 --> 01:58:30,079
but let's step back from that right once

3860
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:32,639
you understand

3861
01:58:30,079 --> 01:58:34,000
the principles of flight you can choose

3862
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:36,079
how to implement them yeah

3863
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:37,198
no one's going to use bones and feathers

3864
01:58:36,079 --> 01:58:40,000
and muscles

3865
01:58:37,198 --> 01:58:41,598
um but they do have wings and uh we

3866
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,039
don't flap them we have propellers so

3867
01:58:41,599 --> 01:58:45,599
when we have the principles

3868
01:58:43,039 --> 01:58:48,000
of of computation that goes on to

3869
01:58:45,599 --> 01:58:50,159
modeling the world in the brain we

3870
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:51,840
understand those principles very clearly

3871
01:58:50,158 --> 01:58:53,198
we have choices on how to implement them

3872
01:58:51,840 --> 01:58:54,400
and some of them will be biologically

3873
01:58:53,198 --> 01:58:57,598
like and some won't

3874
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:59,598
and um but i do think there's going to

3875
01:58:57,599 --> 01:59:00,639
be a huge amount of innovation here

3876
01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:02,880
just think about the innovation we're in

3877
01:59:00,639 --> 01:59:05,679
the computers they had to invent the the

3878
01:59:02,880 --> 01:59:06,319
transistor they invented the the silicon

3879
01:59:05,679 --> 01:59:08,319
ship

3880
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:09,439
they had the invent you know then this

3881
01:59:08,319 --> 01:59:10,880
software i mean

3882
01:59:09,439 --> 01:59:12,960
zillions of things they had to do memory

3883
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:14,560
systems um we're gonna do

3884
01:59:12,960 --> 01:59:16,158
it's gonna be similar well it's

3885
01:59:14,560 --> 01:59:18,960
interesting that the deep

3886
01:59:16,158 --> 01:59:19,679
learning um the effectiveness of deep

3887
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:21,840
learning for

3888
01:59:19,679 --> 01:59:23,118
a specific task is driving a lot of

3889
01:59:21,840 --> 01:59:26,239
innovation in the hardware

3890
01:59:23,118 --> 01:59:28,880
which may have effects for uh

3891
01:59:26,238 --> 01:59:30,479
actually allowing us to discover

3892
01:59:28,880 --> 01:59:31,118
intelligent systems that operate very

3893
01:59:30,479 --> 01:59:32,559
differently

3894
01:59:31,118 --> 01:59:34,158
or that's much bigger than deep learning

3895
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:36,560
yeah interesting so

3896
01:59:34,158 --> 01:59:37,920
ultimately it's good to have an

3897
01:59:36,560 --> 01:59:39,039
application that's making our life

3898
01:59:37,920 --> 01:59:41,760
better now

3899
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:42,960
because the the the capitalist process

3900
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:45,039
if you can make money

3901
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,239
yeah yeah that works i mean the other

3902
01:59:45,039 --> 01:59:48,238
way i mean

3903
01:59:46,238 --> 01:59:49,919
neil degrasse tyson writes about this is

3904
01:59:48,238 --> 01:59:51,439
the other way we fund science of course

3905
01:59:49,920 --> 01:59:54,399
is through military

3906
01:59:51,439 --> 01:59:55,439
so like yeah uh conquest so here here's

3907
01:59:54,399 --> 01:59:56,238
an interesting thing we're doing on this

3908
01:59:55,439 --> 01:59:58,158
regard

3909
01:59:56,238 --> 01:59:59,678
so we've decided we we used to have a

3910
01:59:58,158 --> 02:00:00,559
series these biological principles and

3911
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:02,000
we can see how to build these

3912
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:04,400
intelligent machines

3913
02:00:02,000 --> 02:00:06,079
but we've decided to apply some of these

3914
02:00:04,399 --> 02:00:07,279
principles to today's machine learning

3915
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:08,960
techniques

3916
02:00:07,279 --> 02:00:10,479
so uh one of the we didn't talk about

3917
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:12,560
this principle one is uh

3918
02:00:10,479 --> 02:00:13,919
sparsity in the brain um most of the

3919
02:00:12,560 --> 02:00:15,520
neurons are active at any point in time

3920
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,800
as far as and the connectivity is sparse

3921
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,760
and that's different than deep learning

3922
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:20,400
networks

3923
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:22,800
um so we've already shown that we can

3924
02:00:20,399 --> 02:00:26,158
speed up existing deep learning networks

3925
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:28,880
uh anywhere from 10 to a factor of 100

3926
02:00:26,158 --> 02:00:29,519
i mean literally 100 and make it more

3927
02:00:28,880 --> 02:00:31,599
robust

3928
02:00:29,520 --> 02:00:33,040
at the same time so this is commercially

3929
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:36,960
very very valuable

3930
02:00:33,039 --> 02:00:39,118
um and so you know if we can prove this

3931
02:00:36,960 --> 02:00:40,800
actually in the larger systems that are

3932
02:00:39,118 --> 02:00:43,359
commercially applied today

3933
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:44,320
there's a big commercial desire to do

3934
02:00:43,359 --> 02:00:47,920
this well

3935
02:00:44,319 --> 02:00:50,000
sparsity is something that doesn't run

3936
02:00:47,920 --> 02:00:51,679
really well on existing hardware it

3937
02:00:50,000 --> 02:00:55,920
doesn't really run really well

3938
02:00:51,679 --> 02:00:58,319
on gpus um and on cpus

3939
02:00:55,920 --> 02:00:59,520
and so that would be a way of sort of

3940
02:00:58,319 --> 02:01:01,118
bringing more and

3941
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:03,280
more brain principles into the existing

3942
02:01:01,118 --> 02:01:03,920
system on a on a commercially valuable

3943
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:05,279
basis

3944
02:01:03,920 --> 02:01:07,599
another thing we can think we can do is

3945
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:11,039
we're going to use the dendrites

3946
02:01:07,599 --> 02:01:12,480
models of we i talked earlier about the

3947
02:01:11,039 --> 02:01:14,880
the prediction occurring inside of

3948
02:01:12,479 --> 02:01:15,678
neuron that that basic property can be

3949
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:17,840
applied to

3950
02:01:15,679 --> 02:01:19,359
existing neural networks and allow them

3951
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:20,719
to learn continuously which something

3952
02:01:19,359 --> 02:01:24,079
they don't do today

3953
02:01:20,719 --> 02:01:25,439
and so yeah well

3954
02:01:24,079 --> 02:01:27,359
we wouldn't model this spikes but the

3955
02:01:25,439 --> 02:01:28,879
idea that you have that

3956
02:01:27,359 --> 02:01:30,000
neuro today's neural networks have

3957
02:01:28,880 --> 02:01:31,920
something called the point neuron which

3958
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:34,399
is a very simple model of a neuron

3959
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:36,639
and uh by adding dendrites to them with

3960
02:01:34,399 --> 02:01:38,319
just one more level of complexity

3961
02:01:36,639 --> 02:01:40,719
that's in biological systems you can

3962
02:01:38,319 --> 02:01:44,238
solve problems in continuous learning

3963
02:01:40,719 --> 02:01:44,639
um and rapid learning so we're trying to

3964
02:01:44,238 --> 02:01:47,759
take

3965
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:48,880
we're trying to bring the existing field

3966
02:01:47,760 --> 02:01:50,000
and we'll see if we can do it we're

3967
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:52,239
trying to bring the existing field of

3968
02:01:50,000 --> 02:01:53,760
machine learning

3969
02:01:52,238 --> 02:01:55,279
commercially along with us you brought

3970
02:01:53,760 --> 02:01:56,000
up this idea of keeping you know paying

3971
02:01:55,279 --> 02:01:57,599
for it

3972
02:01:56,000 --> 02:01:59,359
commercially along with us as we move

3973
02:01:57,599 --> 02:02:00,319
towards the ultimate goal of a true ai

3974
02:01:59,359 --> 02:02:01,759
system

3975
02:02:00,319 --> 02:02:04,000
even small innovations on neural

3976
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:06,159
networks are really really exciting

3977
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,520
yeah because it seems like such a

3978
02:02:06,158 --> 02:02:10,399
trivial model

3979
02:02:07,520 --> 02:02:11,920
of the brain and applying different

3980
02:02:10,399 --> 02:02:14,158
insights

3981
02:02:11,920 --> 02:02:15,199
that just even like you said continuous

3982
02:02:14,158 --> 02:02:19,359
uh learning

3983
02:02:15,198 --> 02:02:22,559
or uh making it more asynchronous

3984
02:02:19,359 --> 02:02:25,519
or maybe making more dynamic or

3985
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:27,599
like uh incentivizing making it fast

3986
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:31,199
even just from robots

3987
02:02:27,599 --> 02:02:34,480
and making it somehow much better

3988
02:02:31,198 --> 02:02:36,319
incentivizing sparsity uh somehow yeah

3989
02:02:34,479 --> 02:02:39,598
uh well if you can make things 100 times

3990
02:02:36,319 --> 02:02:41,198
faster then there's plenty of incentive

3991
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:42,800
people people spending millions of

3992
02:02:41,198 --> 02:02:44,000
dollars you know just training some of

3993
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:47,360
these networks now these

3994
02:02:44,000 --> 02:02:48,560
uh these transformer networks let me ask

3995
02:02:47,359 --> 02:02:51,198
you a big question

3996
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:52,159
how for young people uh listening to

3997
02:02:51,198 --> 02:02:54,238
this today

3998
02:02:52,158 --> 02:02:55,359
in high school and college what advice

3999
02:02:54,238 --> 02:02:58,879
would you give them

4000
02:02:55,359 --> 02:03:03,118
in terms of uh which career path to take

4001
02:02:58,880 --> 02:03:06,159
and um maybe just about life in general

4002
02:03:03,118 --> 02:03:07,598
well in my case um

4003
02:03:06,158 --> 02:03:10,000
i didn't start life with any kind of

4004
02:03:07,599 --> 02:03:11,599
goals i was when i was going to college

4005
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:11,920
i was like oh what did i say well maybe

4006
02:03:11,599 --> 02:03:15,119
i'll do

4007
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:16,319
electrical engineering stuff you know um

4008
02:03:15,118 --> 02:03:17,198
it wasn't like you know today you see

4009
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:18,319
some of these young kids are so

4010
02:03:17,198 --> 02:03:19,598
motivated they're going to change the

4011
02:03:18,319 --> 02:03:22,639
world i was like

4012
02:03:19,599 --> 02:03:24,400
you know whatever and um

4013
02:03:22,639 --> 02:03:26,560
but then i did fall in love with

4014
02:03:24,399 --> 02:03:28,638
something besides my wife but i fell in

4015
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:30,000
love with this like oh my god it would

4016
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:30,800
be so cool to understand how the brain

4017
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:32,319
works

4018
02:03:30,800 --> 02:03:33,920
and then i i said to myself that's the

4019
02:03:32,319 --> 02:03:35,279
most important thing i could work on

4020
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:36,800
i i can't imagine anything more

4021
02:03:35,279 --> 02:03:37,840
important because if we understand how

4022
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:39,199
brains work you'd build telescope

4023
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:40,480
machines and they could figure out

4024
02:03:39,198 --> 02:03:42,638
all the other big questions of the world

4025
02:03:40,479 --> 02:03:44,000
right so and then i said

4026
02:03:42,639 --> 02:03:45,840
i want to understand how i work so i

4027
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:47,599
fell in love with this idea and i became

4028
02:03:45,840 --> 02:03:51,039
passionate about it

4029
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:51,679
and this is you know a trope people say

4030
02:03:51,039 --> 02:03:54,479
this but it was

4031
02:03:51,679 --> 02:03:55,279
it's true because i was passionate about

4032
02:03:54,479 --> 02:03:58,399
it

4033
02:03:55,279 --> 02:04:01,039
i was able to put up almost so much crap

4034
02:03:58,399 --> 02:04:02,078
you know you know i was i was in that

4035
02:04:01,039 --> 02:04:03,920
you know i was like

4036
02:04:02,078 --> 02:04:05,359
person said you can't do this i was i

4037
02:04:03,920 --> 02:04:07,039
was a graduate student at berkeley when

4038
02:04:05,359 --> 02:04:08,479
they said you can't study this problem

4039
02:04:07,039 --> 02:04:10,479
you know no one's gonna solve this or

4040
02:04:08,479 --> 02:04:11,919
you can't get funded for it you know

4041
02:04:10,479 --> 02:04:13,198
then i went to do you know mobile

4042
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:14,480
computing and it was like people say you

4043
02:04:13,198 --> 02:04:15,759
can't do that you can't build a cell

4044
02:04:14,479 --> 02:04:18,319
phone

4045
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:19,760
you know so but all along i kept being

4046
02:04:18,319 --> 02:04:21,599
motivated because i wanted to work on

4047
02:04:19,760 --> 02:04:23,360
this problem i said i want to understand

4048
02:04:21,599 --> 02:04:24,960
the brain works and if i got myself male

4049
02:04:23,359 --> 02:04:25,279
i got one lifetime i'm gonna figure it

4050
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:29,279
out

4051
02:04:25,279 --> 02:04:31,039
do the best i can so by having that

4052
02:04:29,279 --> 02:04:32,800
because you know these it's really as

4053
02:04:31,039 --> 02:04:34,719
you point out lex it's really hard to

4054
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:36,880
do these things people it's just there's

4055
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:38,319
so many downers along the way

4056
02:04:36,880 --> 02:04:40,000
so many ways obstacles are getting your

4057
02:04:38,319 --> 02:04:40,799
way yeah i'm sitting here happy all the

4058
02:04:40,000 --> 02:04:42,800
time but trust me

4059
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,400
it's not always like that that's i guess

4060
02:04:42,800 --> 02:04:46,400
the the happiness that the

4061
02:04:44,399 --> 02:04:47,598
the passion is a prerequisite for

4062
02:04:46,399 --> 02:04:50,399
surviving the whole

4063
02:04:47,599 --> 02:04:51,039
yeah i think so i think that's right um

4064
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:52,719
and

4065
02:04:51,039 --> 02:04:54,238
so i i don't want to sit to someone and

4066
02:04:52,719 --> 02:04:56,000
say you know you need to find a passion

4067
02:04:54,238 --> 02:04:57,919
and do it no maybe you don't

4068
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,118
but if you do find something you're

4069
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:01,679
passionate about

4070
02:04:59,118 --> 02:05:03,118
then then you can follow it as far as

4071
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:04,480
your passion will

4072
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:06,158
let you put up with it do you remember

4073
02:05:04,479 --> 02:05:09,198
how you found it this is

4074
02:05:06,158 --> 02:05:11,359
how the spark happened

4075
02:05:09,198 --> 02:05:12,399
why specifically for me yeah like

4076
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:14,078
because you said it's

4077
02:05:12,399 --> 02:05:16,078
such an interesting so like almost like

4078
02:05:14,078 --> 02:05:16,399
later in life by later i mean like not

4079
02:05:16,078 --> 02:05:19,359
in

4080
02:05:16,399 --> 02:05:20,000
when you were five yeah you you didn't

4081
02:05:19,359 --> 02:05:21,198
really know

4082
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:22,800
and then all of a sudden you fell in

4083
02:05:21,198 --> 02:05:23,039
love with that yeah yeah there was there

4084
02:05:22,800 --> 02:05:24,159
was

4085
02:05:23,039 --> 02:05:26,560
there's two separate events that

4086
02:05:24,158 --> 02:05:28,238
compounded one another one

4087
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:29,920
when i was probably a teenager might

4088
02:05:28,238 --> 02:05:31,919
have been 17 or 18.

4089
02:05:29,920 --> 02:05:34,078
i made a list of the most interesting

4090
02:05:31,920 --> 02:05:36,078
problems i could think of

4091
02:05:34,078 --> 02:05:38,479
first was why does the universe exist it

4092
02:05:36,078 --> 02:05:40,078
seems like not existing is more likely

4093
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:41,198
yeah the second one was well given

4094
02:05:40,078 --> 02:05:41,599
exists why does it behave the way it

4095
02:05:41,198 --> 02:05:43,359
does

4096
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:45,119
you know it's laws of physics y is equal

4097
02:05:43,359 --> 02:05:46,960
to m c squared not m c cubed you know

4098
02:05:45,118 --> 02:05:48,559
attention question i don't know

4099
02:05:46,960 --> 02:05:50,158
third one was like what's the origin of

4100
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,679
life um

4101
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:53,759
and the fourth one was what's

4102
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:55,039
intelligence and i stopped there

4103
02:05:53,760 --> 02:05:57,679
i said well that's probably the most

4104
02:05:55,039 --> 02:06:01,519
interesting one and i put that aside

4105
02:05:57,679 --> 02:06:04,639
um as a teenager but then when i was 22

4106
02:06:01,520 --> 02:06:06,800
and i was reading the um no it was

4107
02:06:04,639 --> 02:06:08,239
excuse me i was 70 it was 1979 excuse me

4108
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:10,320
1979

4109
02:06:08,238 --> 02:06:11,359
i was reading uh so i was at that time i

4110
02:06:10,319 --> 02:06:13,759
was 22.

4111
02:06:11,359 --> 02:06:15,118
i was reading uh the september issue of

4112
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:16,480
scientific american which is all about

4113
02:06:15,118 --> 02:06:19,439
the brain

4114
02:06:16,479 --> 02:06:20,158
and then the final essay was by francis

4115
02:06:19,439 --> 02:06:23,279
crick

4116
02:06:20,158 --> 02:06:24,719
who of dna fame and he had

4117
02:06:23,279 --> 02:06:27,439
taken his interest to studying the brain

4118
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:29,439
now and he said you know

4119
02:06:27,439 --> 02:06:31,678
there's something wrong here he says we

4120
02:06:29,439 --> 02:06:34,078
got all this data

4121
02:06:31,679 --> 02:06:35,679
oh this fact this is 1979 all these

4122
02:06:34,078 --> 02:06:37,519
facts about the brain tons and tons of

4123
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:39,760
facts about the brain

4124
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:41,119
do we need more facts or do we just need

4125
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:42,480
to think about a way of rearranging the

4126
02:06:41,118 --> 02:06:44,719
facts we have maybe we're just not

4127
02:06:42,479 --> 02:06:47,118
thinking about the problem correctly

4128
02:06:44,719 --> 02:06:47,920
you know because he says this shouldn't

4129
02:06:47,118 --> 02:06:50,559
be

4130
02:06:47,920 --> 02:06:52,639
it shouldn't be like this you know so i

4131
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:55,280
read that and i said wow

4132
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:56,880
i said i don't have to become like an

4133
02:06:55,279 --> 02:07:00,000
experimental neuroscientist

4134
02:06:56,880 --> 02:07:00,480
i could just look at all those facts and

4135
02:07:00,000 --> 02:07:02,158
try to

4136
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:03,598
and become a theoretician and try to

4137
02:07:02,158 --> 02:07:05,679
figure it out

4138
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:06,960
and i said that i felt like it was

4139
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:08,000
something i would be good at

4140
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:09,118
i said i wouldn't be a good

4141
02:07:08,000 --> 02:07:10,479
experimentalist i don't have the

4142
02:07:09,118 --> 02:07:12,960
patience for it

4143
02:07:10,479 --> 02:07:13,759
but i'm a good thinker and i love

4144
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:15,118
puzzles

4145
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,800
and this is like the biggest puzzle in

4146
02:07:15,118 --> 02:07:17,439
the world it's the biggest puzzle of all

4147
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:18,880
time

4148
02:07:17,439 --> 02:07:21,439
and i got all the puzzle pieces in front

4149
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:23,279
of me damn that was exciting

4150
02:07:21,439 --> 02:07:25,919
and there's something obviously you

4151
02:07:23,279 --> 02:07:26,880
can't convert it towards it just kind of

4152
02:07:25,920 --> 02:07:29,039
sparked

4153
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:31,039
this passion and i have that a few times

4154
02:07:29,039 --> 02:07:34,880
in my life just something

4155
02:07:31,039 --> 02:07:36,719
um yeah just just like you uh

4156
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:38,239
it grabs you yeah i thought it was

4157
02:07:36,719 --> 02:07:40,319
something that was both important

4158
02:07:38,238 --> 02:07:41,678
that i could make a contribution to yeah

4159
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:43,759
and so all of a sudden it felt like

4160
02:07:41,679 --> 02:07:45,440
oh it gave me purpose in life yeah you

4161
02:07:43,760 --> 02:07:47,679
know i honestly don't think it has to be

4162
02:07:45,439 --> 02:07:49,919
as big as one of those four questions

4163
02:07:47,679 --> 02:07:51,359
no no i think you can find those things

4164
02:07:49,920 --> 02:07:53,840
in in the smallest

4165
02:07:51,359 --> 02:07:55,519
oh absolutely i'm with uh david foster

4166
02:07:53,840 --> 02:07:57,039
wallace said like the key to life is to

4167
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:59,679
be unborable i'm

4168
02:07:57,039 --> 02:08:00,479
i think i think it's very possible to

4169
02:07:59,679 --> 02:08:02,319
find that

4170
02:08:00,479 --> 02:08:04,238
intensity of joy in the smallest

4171
02:08:02,319 --> 02:08:04,639
absolutely i'm just you asked me my

4172
02:08:04,238 --> 02:08:06,879
story

4173
02:08:04,639 --> 02:08:08,078
yeah yeah i'm actually speaking to the

4174
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:08,960
audience yeah it doesn't have to be

4175
02:08:08,078 --> 02:08:11,039
those four

4176
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:13,439
you happen to get excited by one of the

4177
02:08:11,039 --> 02:08:16,479
bigger questions of

4178
02:08:13,439 --> 02:08:17,759
in the universe but uh but that even the

4179
02:08:16,479 --> 02:08:18,879
smallest things and watching the

4180
02:08:17,760 --> 02:08:22,480
olympics now

4181
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:24,719
just uh just giving yourself life uh

4182
02:08:22,479 --> 02:08:26,479
giving your life over to the study and

4183
02:08:24,719 --> 02:08:27,520
the mastery of a particular sport is

4184
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:30,559
fascinating

4185
02:08:27,520 --> 02:08:32,320
and and uh if if it sparks

4186
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:33,679
joy and passion you're able to in the

4187
02:08:32,319 --> 02:08:35,599
case of the olympics

4188
02:08:33,679 --> 02:08:37,199
basically suffer for like a couple of

4189
02:08:35,599 --> 02:08:39,199
decades to achieve i mean you can find

4190
02:08:37,198 --> 02:08:41,359
joint passion just being a parent i mean

4191
02:08:39,198 --> 02:08:42,559
yeah yeah the the parenting one is funny

4192
02:08:41,359 --> 02:08:44,960
so i always

4193
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:45,840
uh not always but for a long time wanted

4194
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,679
kids and

4195
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:49,599
get married and stuff and especially

4196
02:08:47,679 --> 02:08:53,440
that has to do with the fact that

4197
02:08:49,599 --> 02:08:57,360
i've seen a lot of people that i respect

4198
02:08:53,439 --> 02:09:00,399
get a whole other level of joy from kids

4199
02:08:57,359 --> 02:09:03,279
and you know at first is like

4200
02:09:00,399 --> 02:09:05,039
your thinking is well like i don't have

4201
02:09:03,279 --> 02:09:07,759
enough time in the day

4202
02:09:05,039 --> 02:09:08,479
right if i have this passion which is

4203
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:10,560
true

4204
02:09:08,479 --> 02:09:12,078
yes but like if i want to solve

4205
02:09:10,560 --> 02:09:14,560
intelligence how is this

4206
02:09:12,078 --> 02:09:16,000
kids situation gonna help me but then

4207
02:09:14,560 --> 02:09:19,119
you realize

4208
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:20,960
that uh

4209
02:09:19,118 --> 02:09:23,519
you know like you said the things that

4210
02:09:20,960 --> 02:09:26,319
sparks joy and it's very possible that

4211
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:27,920
kids can provide even a greater or

4212
02:09:26,319 --> 02:09:30,158
deeper more meaningful

4213
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:32,000
joy than those bigger questions yeah

4214
02:09:30,158 --> 02:09:33,598
when they they enrich each other and

4215
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:34,719
that that seemed like um

4216
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:36,480
obviously when i was younger it's

4217
02:09:34,719 --> 02:09:37,840
probably a counter-intuitive notion

4218
02:09:36,479 --> 02:09:38,559
because there's only so many hours in

4219
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:41,199
the day

4220
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:42,960
but then life is finite and you have to

4221
02:09:41,198 --> 02:09:46,000
pick the things that give

4222
02:09:42,960 --> 02:09:48,399
give you joy yeah but you know also

4223
02:09:46,000 --> 02:09:49,840
you understand you you can be patient

4224
02:09:48,399 --> 02:09:51,679
too i mean it's finite

4225
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:53,360
but we do have you know whatever 50

4226
02:09:51,679 --> 02:09:56,000
years or so it's not so long yeah

4227
02:09:53,359 --> 02:09:57,439
so so in my case you know in my case i

4228
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:58,479
had to give up on my dream of the

4229
02:09:57,439 --> 02:10:00,238
neuroscience

4230
02:09:58,479 --> 02:10:01,519
because i i was a graduate student at

4231
02:10:00,238 --> 02:10:03,198
berkeley and they told me i couldn't do

4232
02:10:01,520 --> 02:10:06,560
this and i couldn't get funded and

4233
02:10:03,198 --> 02:10:08,000
you know and and so i went back in

4234
02:10:06,560 --> 02:10:09,520
and went back in the computing industry

4235
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:11,279
for a number of years i thought it would

4236
02:10:09,520 --> 02:10:13,599
be four but it turned out to be more

4237
02:10:11,279 --> 02:10:14,880
but i said but i said i'll come back you

4238
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:16,078
know i definitely i'm definitely gonna

4239
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:17,118
come back i know i'm gonna do this

4240
02:10:16,078 --> 02:10:18,479
computer stuff for a while but i'm

4241
02:10:17,118 --> 02:10:19,279
definitely coming back everyone knows

4242
02:10:18,479 --> 02:10:20,799
that

4243
02:10:19,279 --> 02:10:22,399
and it's they moved like raising kids

4244
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:23,599
well yeah you still you have to spend a

4245
02:10:22,399 --> 02:10:26,638
lot of time with your kids it's fun

4246
02:10:23,599 --> 02:10:28,078
enjoyable um but that doesn't mean

4247
02:10:26,639 --> 02:10:29,520
you have to give up on other dreams it

4248
02:10:28,078 --> 02:10:30,319
just means that you may have to wait a

4249
02:10:29,520 --> 02:10:33,840
week or two

4250
02:10:30,319 --> 02:10:37,359
to work on that next idea well

4251
02:10:33,840 --> 02:10:38,880
you talked about the the the darker side

4252
02:10:37,359 --> 02:10:40,799
of me disappointing sides of human

4253
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:42,400
nature that we're

4254
02:10:40,800 --> 02:10:44,560
hoping to overcome so that we don't

4255
02:10:42,399 --> 02:10:47,359
destroy ourselves i tend to

4256
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:49,679
put a lot of value in um the broad

4257
02:10:47,359 --> 02:10:53,920
general concept of love

4258
02:10:49,679 --> 02:10:57,279
of uh the human capacity to um

4259
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:59,118
of compassion towards each other of just

4260
02:10:57,279 --> 02:11:00,158
kindness whatever that longing of like

4261
02:10:59,118 --> 02:11:01,839
just the human

4262
02:11:00,158 --> 02:11:04,078
human to human connection yeah it

4263
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:06,319
connects back to our initial discussion

4264
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:07,840
i tend to see a lot of value in this

4265
02:11:06,319 --> 02:11:09,359
collective intelligence aspect

4266
02:11:07,840 --> 02:11:12,239
i think some of the magic of human

4267
02:11:09,359 --> 02:11:14,319
civilization happens when there's

4268
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:15,279
uh a party is not as fun when it you're

4269
02:11:14,319 --> 02:11:17,439
alone yeah

4270
02:11:15,279 --> 02:11:18,960
i totally agree with you on these issues

4271
02:11:17,439 --> 02:11:22,238
uh do you think

4272
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:24,078
from a neurocortex perspective

4273
02:11:22,238 --> 02:11:26,158
uh what role does love play in the human

4274
02:11:24,078 --> 02:11:28,319
condition uh well those are two separate

4275
02:11:26,158 --> 02:11:29,759
things from a new project

4276
02:11:28,319 --> 02:11:31,279
i don't think it doesn't impact our

4277
02:11:29,760 --> 02:11:32,320
thinking about human uh about the

4278
02:11:31,279 --> 02:11:33,759
neocortex

4279
02:11:32,319 --> 02:11:36,399
from a human condition point of view i

4280
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:40,320
think it's core um

4281
02:11:36,399 --> 02:11:41,118
i mean we get so much pleasure out of

4282
02:11:40,319 --> 02:11:44,319
loving people

4283
02:11:41,118 --> 02:11:46,960
and helping people um

4284
02:11:44,319 --> 02:11:48,479
so you know i can i'll rack it up to old

4285
02:11:46,960 --> 02:11:49,279
brain stuff and maybe you can throw it

4286
02:11:48,479 --> 02:11:52,158
under the

4287
02:11:49,279 --> 02:11:53,039
the bust of evolution if you want um

4288
02:11:52,158 --> 02:11:55,839
that's fine

4289
02:11:53,039 --> 02:11:58,319
um uh it doesn't impact how i think

4290
02:11:55,840 --> 02:11:59,840
about how we model the world

4291
02:11:58,319 --> 02:12:02,078
but from a humanity point of view i

4292
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:04,480
think it's essential well i tend to

4293
02:12:02,078 --> 02:12:06,000
give it to the new brain and also i tend

4294
02:12:04,479 --> 02:12:08,158
to think that some of aspects

4295
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:09,840
of that need to be engineered into ai

4296
02:12:08,158 --> 02:12:14,078
systems

4297
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:16,078
both in their ability to have compassion

4298
02:12:14,078 --> 02:12:19,279
for other humans

4299
02:12:16,078 --> 02:12:21,840
and their ability to

4300
02:12:19,279 --> 02:12:22,639
maximize love in the world between

4301
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:24,560
humans

4302
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:25,679
so i'm more thinking about the social

4303
02:12:24,560 --> 02:12:27,199
network so like

4304
02:12:25,679 --> 02:12:28,880
whenever there's a deep integration

4305
02:12:27,198 --> 02:12:31,598
between ai systems and humans

4306
02:12:28,880 --> 02:12:32,078
so specific applications where it's uh

4307
02:12:31,599 --> 02:12:35,119
ai

4308
02:12:32,078 --> 02:12:38,880
and humans i think that's something that

4309
02:12:35,118 --> 02:12:43,598
often not talked about in terms of um

4310
02:12:38,880 --> 02:12:46,159
metrics over which you try to maximize

4311
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:46,719
uh like which metric to maximize in a

4312
02:12:46,158 --> 02:12:50,000
system

4313
02:12:46,719 --> 02:12:53,118
it seems like one of the most powerful

4314
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:55,760
things in societies

4315
02:12:53,118 --> 02:12:56,479
is the capacity to work it's fascinating

4316
02:12:55,760 --> 02:12:58,400
i think it's

4317
02:12:56,479 --> 02:13:00,078
it's a great way of thinking about it

4318
02:12:58,399 --> 02:13:01,279
you know i have

4319
02:13:00,078 --> 02:13:03,198
i have been thinking more of these

4320
02:13:01,279 --> 02:13:04,000
fundamental mechanisms in the brain as

4321
02:13:03,198 --> 02:13:05,759
opposed to

4322
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:07,118
the social interaction between the

4323
02:13:05,760 --> 02:13:08,800
interaction between humans and ai

4324
02:13:07,118 --> 02:13:10,158
systems in the future which is

4325
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:12,239
and i think if you think about that

4326
02:13:10,158 --> 02:13:14,238
you're absolutely right um

4327
02:13:12,238 --> 02:13:15,839
but that's that's a complex system i can

4328
02:13:14,238 --> 02:13:16,879
have intelligent systems that don't have

4329
02:13:15,840 --> 02:13:18,159
that component but they're not

4330
02:13:16,880 --> 02:13:19,840
interacting with people you know they're

4331
02:13:18,158 --> 02:13:21,439
just running something or building a

4332
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:22,960
building someplace or something i don't

4333
02:13:21,439 --> 02:13:24,479
know um

4334
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:26,480
but if you think about interacting with

4335
02:13:24,479 --> 02:13:27,919
humans yeah it's it's gonna

4336
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:29,118
and then but it has to be engineered in

4337
02:13:27,920 --> 02:13:30,560
there i don't think it's gonna appear on

4338
02:13:29,118 --> 02:13:32,960
its own

4339
02:13:30,560 --> 02:13:34,960
uh that's a good question i yeah well we

4340
02:13:32,960 --> 02:13:39,198
could

4341
02:13:34,960 --> 02:13:41,599
in terms of uh uh from a reinforcement

4342
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:45,039
learning perspective

4343
02:13:41,599 --> 02:13:47,119
whether the darker sides of human nature

4344
02:13:45,039 --> 02:13:49,599
or the better angels of our nature

4345
02:13:47,118 --> 02:13:50,319
uh win out yeah statistically speaking i

4346
02:13:49,599 --> 02:13:52,239
don't know

4347
02:13:50,319 --> 02:13:53,840
i tend to be optimistic and hope that

4348
02:13:52,238 --> 02:13:56,959
love wins out in the end

4349
02:13:53,840 --> 02:14:00,400
um you've done a lot of incredible stuff

4350
02:13:56,960 --> 02:14:02,800
and your book is uh

4351
02:14:00,399 --> 02:14:04,479
driving towards this fourth question

4352
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:06,639
that you started with

4353
02:14:04,479 --> 02:14:07,598
on the nature of intelligence what do

4354
02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:10,719
you hope your

4355
02:14:07,599 --> 02:14:13,199
legacy for people reading a hundred

4356
02:14:10,719 --> 02:14:14,880
years from now

4357
02:14:13,198 --> 02:14:17,279
how do you hope they remember your work

4358
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:19,920
how do you hope they remember this book

4359
02:14:17,279 --> 02:14:21,519
well i think as an entrepreneur or

4360
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:23,279
scientist or

4361
02:14:21,520 --> 02:14:26,800
any human who's trying to accomplish

4362
02:14:23,279 --> 02:14:29,198
some things i have a view that

4363
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:30,480
really all you can do is accelerate the

4364
02:14:29,198 --> 02:14:33,279
inevitable

4365
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:34,718
um yeah it's like you know if we didn't

4366
02:14:33,279 --> 02:14:35,840
figure out if we didn't study the brain

4367
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:37,118
someone else would study the brain if

4368
02:14:35,840 --> 02:14:38,400
you know if elon just

4369
02:14:37,118 --> 02:14:40,319
didn't make electric cars someone else

4370
02:14:38,399 --> 02:14:41,839
would do it eventually and if you know

4371
02:14:40,319 --> 02:14:44,078
if thomas anderson didn't invent a light

4372
02:14:41,840 --> 02:14:47,119
bulb we wouldn't be using candles today

4373
02:14:44,078 --> 02:14:48,880
so what you can do as an individual is

4374
02:14:47,118 --> 02:14:51,279
you can accelerate

4375
02:14:48,880 --> 02:14:52,560
something that's beneficial and make it

4376
02:14:51,279 --> 02:14:54,639
happen sooner than whatever that's

4377
02:14:52,560 --> 02:14:57,280
that's really it that's all you can do

4378
02:14:54,639 --> 02:14:58,960
um you can't create a new reality that

4379
02:14:57,279 --> 02:15:02,158
it wasn't gonna happen

4380
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:05,118
um so from that perspective

4381
02:15:02,158 --> 02:15:06,000
um i would hope that our work not just

4382
02:15:05,118 --> 02:15:08,559
me but our work

4383
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,118
in general um people would look back and

4384
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:10,880
said

4385
02:15:09,118 --> 02:15:12,399
hey they really helped make this better

4386
02:15:10,880 --> 02:15:15,760
future happen sooner

4387
02:15:12,399 --> 02:15:17,439
um they you know they helped us

4388
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:19,039
understand the nature of false beliefs

4389
02:15:17,439 --> 02:15:20,638
sooner than we met up they made it

4390
02:15:19,039 --> 02:15:21,920
now we're so happy that we have these

4391
02:15:20,639 --> 02:15:22,719
intelligent machines doing these things

4392
02:15:21,920 --> 02:15:24,639
helping us

4393
02:15:22,719 --> 02:15:26,158
that that maybe that solved the climate

4394
02:15:24,639 --> 02:15:28,560
change problem and

4395
02:15:26,158 --> 02:15:29,519
they made it happen sooner so i think

4396
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:31,119
that's the best

4397
02:15:29,520 --> 02:15:32,719
i would hope for some would say those

4398
02:15:31,118 --> 02:15:34,639
guys just

4399
02:15:32,719 --> 02:15:36,560
moved the needle forward a little bit in

4400
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:38,719
time well

4401
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:41,360
i do it it feels like the progress of

4402
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:44,560
human civilization is not

4403
02:15:41,359 --> 02:15:48,479
is uh there's a lot of trajectories and

4404
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:51,039
if you have individuals that accelerate

4405
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:52,319
towards one direction that helps steer

4406
02:15:51,039 --> 02:15:55,920
human civilization so

4407
02:15:52,319 --> 02:15:58,078
i think in this long stretch of time all

4408
02:15:55,920 --> 02:15:59,199
all trajectories will be traveled but i

4409
02:15:58,078 --> 02:16:00,960
think it's nice

4410
02:15:59,198 --> 02:16:02,719
for this particular civilization on

4411
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:04,000
earth to travel down one that's not yeah

4412
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:04,399
well i think you're right i mean look we

4413
02:16:04,000 --> 02:16:06,000
have the

4414
02:16:04,399 --> 02:16:07,279
take the whole period of you know world

4415
02:16:06,000 --> 02:16:09,520
war ii nazism or something like that

4416
02:16:07,279 --> 02:16:11,679
well that was a bad sidestep right

4417
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:13,360
went over there for a while but you know

4418
02:16:11,679 --> 02:16:14,000
there is the optimistic view about life

4419
02:16:13,359 --> 02:16:16,960
that

4420
02:16:14,000 --> 02:16:18,078
um that ultimately it does converge in a

4421
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:20,158
positive way

4422
02:16:18,078 --> 02:16:21,118
it progresses ultimately even if we have

4423
02:16:20,158 --> 02:16:25,279
years of

4424
02:16:21,118 --> 02:16:26,078
darkness um so yeah so i think you can

4425
02:16:25,279 --> 02:16:28,078
perhaps

4426
02:16:26,078 --> 02:16:30,000
that's accelerating the positive it

4427
02:16:28,078 --> 02:16:32,558
could also mean eliminating some bad

4428
02:16:30,000 --> 02:16:35,120
missteps along the way too um

4429
02:16:32,558 --> 02:16:36,879
but but i i'm an optimistic in that way

4430
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:38,479
i was like you know despite we talked

4431
02:16:36,879 --> 02:16:40,239
about the end of civilization

4432
02:16:38,478 --> 02:16:42,000
you know i i think we're gonna live for

4433
02:16:40,239 --> 02:16:43,760
a long time i hope we are

4434
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:44,718
um i think our society in the future is

4435
02:16:43,760 --> 02:16:46,079
gonna be better we're gonna have less

4436
02:16:44,718 --> 02:16:47,518
discord we're gonna have less people

4437
02:16:46,079 --> 02:16:48,718
killing each other you know we'll solve

4438
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:50,159
you know we'll make the

4439
02:16:48,718 --> 02:16:52,000
they'll live in some sort of way that's

4440
02:16:50,159 --> 02:16:52,879
compatible with the carrying capacity of

4441
02:16:52,000 --> 02:16:54,879
the earth

4442
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:56,000
um i'm optimistic these things will

4443
02:16:54,879 --> 02:16:57,358
happen

4444
02:16:56,000 --> 02:17:00,000
and all we can do is try to get there

4445
02:16:57,359 --> 02:17:01,599
sooner and at the very least if we do

4446
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:04,159
destroy ourselves we'll have a few

4447
02:17:01,599 --> 02:17:04,159
satellites

4448
02:17:04,638 --> 02:17:07,759
i will uh that will tell alien

4449
02:17:06,398 --> 02:17:10,879
civilization that we

4450
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:12,318
were once or maybe our future you know

4451
02:17:10,879 --> 02:17:14,000
future inhabitants of earth you know

4452
02:17:12,318 --> 02:17:15,359
imagine you know

4453
02:17:14,000 --> 02:17:16,879
the planet of the apes scenario you know

4454
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:18,159
we kill ourselves in a you know million

4455
02:17:16,879 --> 02:17:19,598
years from now or billion years from now

4456
02:17:18,159 --> 02:17:22,558
there's another species on the planet

4457
02:17:19,599 --> 02:17:22,880
curious creatures were once here yeah um
