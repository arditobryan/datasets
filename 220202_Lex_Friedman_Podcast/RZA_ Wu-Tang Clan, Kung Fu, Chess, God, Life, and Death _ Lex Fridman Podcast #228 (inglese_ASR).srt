10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,439
conversation with rizza

11
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:29,839
in the tao of wu you're right when my

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,399
mother left the physical world i lost

13
00:00:29,839 --> 00:00:35,119
one of my main links to the universe

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,280
they say that you have an umbilical cord

15
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:39,199
and an etheric cord which is the

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,079
invisible cord that attaches you to your

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,879
soul your mother's soul and all other

18
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,320
souls when one passes away you really

19
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,359
lose something

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,238
it's physical and mental it's real

21
00:00:49,359 --> 00:00:52,238
part of you dies

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,840
what have you learned about life from

23
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:00,000
your mother

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,039
i now learn life itself for my mother

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,079
you know

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,879
being

27
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,719
one of 11 children

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,159
and seeing the sacrifice that she gave

29
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:12,719
to us

30
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,799
therefore given to life

31
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,560
uh it's really the greatest lesson of

32
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,479
life

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,920
the thing that uh

34
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,400
shook me as i

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,799
wrote those words

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,520
was

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,439
coming up young

38
00:01:27,519 --> 00:01:31,519
with arrogance

39
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,000
confidence

40
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,798
knowledge of myself

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,400
they called me the scientists

42
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,799
we was taught

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,478
do the supreme being in order to be the

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,680
supreme being you got to be supreme

45
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:46,959
amongst other beings

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,680
um

47
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:52,879
i understand that more now than i did

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,720
then because then it was so literal

49
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,718
you know the word god

50
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,239
derived

51
00:01:56,718 --> 00:01:59,759
basically from the greek language as

52
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,519
they say and it

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,000
meant wisdom strength and beauty

54
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:09,679
here we could have that

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,439
but the power to control life and death

56
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:15,199
is something that

57
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:17,520
you would assume is a god trait

58
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,039
so now here you are saying that you're a

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
god

60
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,840
right

61
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:24,318
and you're reading the bible how jesus

62
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,719
brought back lazarus

63
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,079
and you know now it's your turn to do

64
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:30,080
something

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,160
and when my mother was laying there in

66
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,000
the hospital bed

67
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:37,598
and air was no longer coming out of her

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,280
lungs and going into her lungs

69
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,598
where's my power to bring her back to

70
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,598
life

71
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:46,159
so you can't

72
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,959
truly be god you're powerless

73
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,439
yeah or god is not the definition that

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,680
we need to use to describe it

75
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:56,159
because it's a translation of wisdom

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,400
strength and beauty so you could be that

77
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,079
but uh so i'm asking your question what

78
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,680
did my mother teach me about life i

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,840
learned that day on physical passing

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,840
okay

81
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:10,559
and i mean there's a physical me

82
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,000
do you think about her

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,598
you miss her

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,400
of course

85
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:17,679
i

86
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,519
keep my mother my prayer every day

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,519
and the thing i pray the most

88
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:27,439
uh beyond giving thanks is

89
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:30,158
i pray that her name is honored and

90
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:31,519
remembered by my family

91
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:33,519
i don't know if the world's gonna

92
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,039
remember right

93
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,120
even though if you watch my movie love

94
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,158
beats rhymes i named the school in that

95
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,840
movie

96
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:42,798
after my mother just

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,719
leave it somewhere else

98
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,599
in physical space yeah exactly but yeah

99
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:52,560
painful the pain of my mother's

100
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,719
passion is indescribable only until it

101
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,400
happens to a person

102
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:57,919
they know and then they won't describe

103
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,120
it either only the people that lost

104
00:03:57,919 --> 00:04:00,958
their mother they could look at each

105
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,158
other and they got this nod you know

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,598
what i mean

107
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:10,239
um but one other thing happened to me

108
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:10,238
was the joy of life hit me differently

109
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,399
and i think it was the realization

110
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,120
of my own

111
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:22,879
mortality versus my immortality

112
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
it's a big big thing and i don't know if

113
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:27,360
we'll get to expound on that but there

114
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,319
was a joy that overcame me because i was

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,879
kind of free of a certain illusion

116
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:35,199
about the immortality

117
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:37,759
of my physical being

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,960
versus the mortality of my physical

119
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,400
being

120
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:44,959
and i was like okay wow i understand so

121
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,719
that was the first or the hardest

122
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:48,560
realization you've experienced that

123
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,600
you're mortal

124
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,439
yeah that yeah and i'll say mortal

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,439
and the what you're looking at here

126
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:58,000
physically

127
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,839
i won't say my soul is mortal

128
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,079
right i'll say it's immortal because at

129
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,560
the end of the day

130
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,038
it's just like i could sit here

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,079
and i could just hum please please

132
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,599
please

133
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:13,198
by james brown but james brown

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,240
is not going to

135
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,240
come in here and do that

136
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,399
so in some sense james brown is still

137
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,399
here in another sense

138
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:24,959
so the soul is here

139
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:26,959
well it lives through you by you singing

140
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,719
it enlists through you by you listening

141
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,038
to it celebrating it

142
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,000
and the hope is that uh the human

143
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:35,680
species continues to celebrate the the

144
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,720
great minds and the great creations of

145
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,240
the past

146
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,240
i would add this to that equation

147
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,159
when i say it's immortal

148
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,240
i don't think not just only because

149
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,479
somebody sings it right

150
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,400
it's like why where's the fire at right

151
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:53,918
now

152
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,758
it's in the air

153
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,758
you just gotta spark this

154
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,359
yeah

155
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,600
so it's always there

156
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,919
are you afraid of death

157
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,160
nah i'm not afraid of death

158
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:09,918
i'm not trying to see it you know

159
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,479
i'm not rushing that nowhere near me

160
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,639
right because all i know is life

161
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,719
right my life is living

162
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,280
um you know i read a lot of ancient

163
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,880
texts people probably know about me and

164
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:22,799
i love one of the great teachers named

165
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,000
bodhidama

166
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,600
uh

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,839
and there was a

168
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,800
thing written in you know one of the

169
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,478
uh

170
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,439
books of his or one of the teachings of

171
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,120
his and the question somebody asks him

172
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,279
similar question you know you're scared

173
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,280
of death or what are you going to be

174
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,359
after you die

175
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,519
and his answer was i don't know

176
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,280
he had answers to everything

177
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,038
but he's like i don't know this oh he

178
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,038
doesn't know that so yeah because i

179
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,038
haven't died yet yeah

180
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,360
well the uncertainty to some people is

181
00:06:51,038 --> 00:06:54,879
terrifying not knowing what's on the

182
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,000
other side of the door

183
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,079
yeah

184
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
i mean especially when you're young you

185
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:01,120
know as a kid

186
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
fear

187
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,959
permeated my life

188
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,120
you know i mean you know i was actually

189
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,359
watching horror movies and

190
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,519
i believed in all type of uh

191
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,319
supernatural things that could uh can

192
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:15,680
happen i thought i saw things as well

193
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,199
and uh

194
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,800
you know whether it was being projected

195
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,038
for my own mind or whether it was there

196
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
visible to me i don't know right

197
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:23,598
um

198
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,478
but

199
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:28,079
life is beautiful

200
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:30,399
and if we have it

201
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,800
and we should use it all the way to the

202
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,799
last job

203
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,960
realizing the mortality

204
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,800
the the gift your mother gave to you is

205
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,198
realizing the immortal

206
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,759
and in so doing help you realize that

207
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:46,960
life is beautiful yeah

208
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,199
on this topic uh quincy jones i read

209
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:54,560
said to odbnu when it rains get wet

210
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,560
what do these words mean to you

211
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,519
well i think what quincy was saying at

212
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,000
that time was you know

213
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:03,758
i think i was more conservative

214
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,839
like as a person

215
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,199
and like you know i

216
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:08,959
had money

217
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,280
women wanted me

218
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,399
anything i kind of wanted

219
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,839
uh

220
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:15,038
i probably could have had you know what

221
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:16,478
i mean

222
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:18,959
and he was just saying when it rains to

223
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,318
get wet enjoy this man it's raining on

224
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,519
you

225
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,280
you know i mean let me pick up don't put

226
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:24,240
up the umbrella don't go back in the

227
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,439
house

228
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,759
yeah get wet experience the moment yeah

229
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:31,680
and enjoy it and

230
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,479
i didn't take total heed to him at that

231
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,200
time

232
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,080
a couple of years later i took some heat

233
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,879
by that time i didn't take heat and

234
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,440
and when i took heat

235
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,919
i think that i

236
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,080
may have misinterpreted

237
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:50,799
by looking at his example of getting wet

238
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,879
versus my example of getting wet

239
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:56,079
and i can tell you right now i'm getting

240
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:58,320
wet right now in my way

241
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,160
in part thanks to your mother but

242
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,879
overall you just learned how to

243
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,879
appreciate the rain just like the

244
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:06,399
the experience of every moment yeah and

245
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,320
i'll share this with you because we this

246
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,360
is seem to be a very open conversation

247
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,800
and i haven't had this conversation so

248
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,200
definitely impart to my mother than

249
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:17,919
impart to my wife

250
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,440
i meet my wife

251
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:22,319
it's my second wife

252
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,760
but i met her after my mother passed and

253
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,519
she was just a friend

254
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,039
you know some girl i met at the thought

255
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,720
she was beautiful

256
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,559
and actually built a friendship with her

257
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,480
uh but

258
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:36,399
a few years later when the relationship

259
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,399
became like you know this is this is

260
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,039
gonna be my woman it was actually doing

261
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,440
it when i was doing the middle of my

262
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:46,559
of my divorce and i was like you know do

263
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,160
i run wild and hey you know i mean my

264
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,599
wife would have already found we were

265
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:54,000
separated and do i run wild and i didn't

266
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,360
run wild a little bit but not too wild

267
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,480
right

268
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,399
and uh

269
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,159
you know i'm still a man right yeah i'm

270
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,759
a hip-hop guy

271
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:02,639
i read you know how to party yeah

272
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,439
exactly

273
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:08,240
but the funny thing is that

274
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,680
my wife now her name is talani

275
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
my uncle

276
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:13,278
said she

277
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,879
reminds me

278
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,200
of your mother

279
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,720
he knew my mother when before i knew my

280
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,040
mother

281
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,480
and he saw that and

282
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:26,799
and we ended up uh dating

283
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,000
um got engaged

284
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,000
and then her mother passes

285
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:34,639
and so now there's a total understanding

286
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,600
of

287
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:39,439
everything and we actually helped build

288
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,120
each other back up so when

289
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,880
so of course i have to thank my mother

290
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,639
for the awareness

291
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,480
um then i thank my wife for

292
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,399
bringing that awareness to actual

293
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,399
actualization

294
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,000
like to actually feel

295
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,440
it i don't think i'll be talking to you

296
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,639
right now and talking as much as i do

297
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,959
these days

298
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,919
if it wasn't for the security and

299
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:03,838
peace and harmony that i was able to

300
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:05,519
gain at home

301
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,360
you know so

302
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,600
and like you said you now share that

303
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,839
look of having to both lost here yeah

304
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,759
your

305
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,519
mom have you learned from quincy about

306
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:22,159
music about business about life

307
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,839
quincy jones is a great mind a great

308
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,879
artist uh

309
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,680
you know a treasure in all reality

310
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:31,278
he's seen it from when it was

311
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,958
he couldn't walk on this he couldn't eat

312
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:33,919
in the same places he played his music

313
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,958
at

314
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,278
to owning places bigger than those so

315
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,599
what a beautiful life you know

316
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:43,838
um

317
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,440
he's the type of guy you spend one hour

318
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,279
with him

319
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
you get you got a lifetime of

320
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,159
information

321
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,319
and i was blessed to spend multiple

322
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:53,838
hours with him in days with him and

323
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,160
you know just a certain period of time

324
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,160
where we came across each other and he

325
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:59,759
was always

326
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,278
there to share the knowledge like that's

327
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,480
another thing about him that i think was

328
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:03,679
special and

329
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,920
hopefully

330
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,199
i picked that up is that

331
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:11,919
he's he he's always willing to share

332
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
share with his experience his knowledge

333
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,159
i mean

334
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,278
i think he'll even share

335
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:18,958
his home

336
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,399
to the right person if he feels that

337
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,518
that's what they need to get back on

338
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,600
their feet he's a very beautiful man

339
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,600
just the kindness the goodness of the

340
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,720
man is like the thing that really rubbed

341
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,079
off on you

342
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,959
yeah i mean

343
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,638
minimum i i mean quincy jones also in

344
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,399
his 50s

345
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,639
as a producer

346
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,879
produced one of the greatest albums of

347
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,320
all time and one of the greatest selling

348
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:43,600
albums of all time that's just great

349
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,680
critically

350
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,480
economically great

351
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,479
and

352
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,320
i mean he may i think he's he did it at

353
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:53,839
the age i am right now so i might have a

354
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,839
great year coming up

355
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,679
timing well yeah

356
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,759
so now you got a taste of what greatness

357
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:05,120
is you get to see what greatness is so

358
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:06,559
you know what uh exactly how yourself

359
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,480
yeah

360
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,479
you have a few people you've worked with

361
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,519
who are fascinating like yourself

362
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,360
quentin tarantino you worked with him

363
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,320
uh when somebody asked you to describe

364
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,159
him with one word you said encyclopedia

365
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,560
what have you learned from the guy about

366
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,879
filmmaking about life again

367
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:26,239
a very generous man with his knowledge

368
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,958
and for me

369
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,519
he shared it i think in a way that was

370
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:34,159
unique in the sense of

371
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,879
you know at a point in time you know we

372
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,559
just was super duper tight like you know

373
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,399
like going to his crib and watching

374
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,479
movies and

375
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,320
and just having long conversations about

376
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
art and about life

377
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,199
you know i mean

378
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,880
um so i learned a lot i consider him you

379
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,359
know especially when it comes to

380
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,198
anything cinematic in my life

381
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,240
i consider him the godfather of that for

382
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:58,240
me

383
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,278
i think um

384
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,680
you know i i humbly asked him

385
00:14:01,278 --> 00:14:05,439
to mentor me which is a very humbling

386
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:07,039
thing to do coming from my neighborhood

387
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,639
coming from who i am

388
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,159
coming from i was already a

389
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,120
multi-platinum

390
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,639
artist

391
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,399
you know with

392
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,000
i mean it was a year it was past the

393
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,039
year 2000 already so like 2001 2002 that

394
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,879
i asked

395
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:22,480
him to mentor me so

396
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,799
i was the lizard

397
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,480
yeah you know i mean but i humbled

398
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,319
myself because

399
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,680
i saw him

400
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,680
a craft

401
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:34,559
of brain power

402
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,359
that to me resonated with me but i was

403
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,239
just uh paddling on that i was a nervous

404
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,639
at it

405
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,000
um because i was trying to make movies

406
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,480
in my music

407
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,399
you know trying to make videos and here

408
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,600
was a man who was a master of it and an

409
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,958
encyclopedia of it as well

410
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,720
and uh like film history film history

411
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,119
from whether it's the actor the director

412
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,240
the cinematographer yeah maybe even the

413
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,000
costume designer he may know 50 60 he

414
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,079
may know the 50 greatest costume

415
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,039
designers in his memory

416
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:07,039
yeah i mean

417
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,519
it's god's brain both of you have pretty

418
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,198
good memory

419
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:13,759
i'd love to be a fly in the wall that

420
00:15:11,198 --> 00:15:16,078
conversation yeah and kung fu movies

421
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,198
mostly you guys we actually started

422
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,679
i think we

423
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,519
we started our relationship

424
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,599
trying to outdo each other

425
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,360
knowledge-wise or what yeah movie

426
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,199
knowledge-wise

427
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,639
fu movie knowledge wise

428
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,639
and i think that cat if it wasn't

429
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,600
another category i wouldn't had a chance

430
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:36,079
but at least in that category yeah i was

431
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,278
pretty holding my weight who won

432
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,198
you know what

433
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:43,278
i'll be honest and say that i may

434
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:45,679
have said a few he didn't see yeah but

435
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,198
quentin is older than me yeah

436
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,078
so he could go back

437
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:51,519
further yeah he could go back to 72

438
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,078
but i didn't see one yet you know what i

439
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,440
mean yeah yeah well we uh he said master

440
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,758
the flying guillotine that i got a

441
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,199
chance to uh that you commentate over

442
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,680
today and i got a chance to see the

443
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,120
screening of he said that's one of his

444
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,559
favorites

445
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,078
uh for you

446
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:10,799
uh the 36th chamber of shaolin now the

447
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,719
master killer is your favorite best best

448
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:13,919
ever would you say that's the greatest

449
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,600
kung fu

450
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,599
i mean movie ever

451
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:19,440
it def it's hard to say the greatest

452
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,800
ever right because somebody may make

453
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,800
another one and

454
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:27,758
it depends on your own phase of life but

455
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,278
i'll i will put that first

456
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,360
if i want to introduce somebody to kung

457
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,240
fu movies that's that's a beautiful

458
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,919
entry

459
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,959
you talk about knowledge you talk about

460
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,519
wisdom

461
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,679
what what kind of wisdom do you draw

462
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,320
from kung fu movies the you know what

463
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,479
the martial art itself and the movies

464
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
it's endless wisdom to be drawn and i

465
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,440
draw it

466
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,159
you know

467
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:53,440
i draw it in a way you know that i could

468
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,879
decipher it in my own life

469
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,560
so

470
00:16:54,879 --> 00:16:59,838
for instance

471
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:02,399
in the movie master killer

472
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,038
uh he basically

473
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:07,838
when he does kung fu he does a really a

474
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:10,078
style called the hangar technique

475
00:17:07,838 --> 00:17:12,798
and the director of the movie

476
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,558
is actually a hangar expert

477
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,318
who has a lineage

478
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:19,279
that traces all the way back to shaolin

479
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,318
temple this director always wanted to

480
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,720
keep his

481
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,078
movies pure and the brain hung guard to

482
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,519
the world it's like he wanted to show

483
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:28,960
the world this lineage in fact

484
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:30,639
you just said master of the flying

485
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,400
guillotine is quentin's favorite movie

486
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,759
and we mentioned in 36 champions it's my

487
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,000
favorite movie but

488
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:38,879
the action director of master of flying

489
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,038
guillotine is the director of 36

490
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,960
chambers of charlotte yeah and some of

491
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:43,759
the things that's happening

492
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,679
in

493
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:48,720
mass of the fl of the flying guillotine

494
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,559
is really the infant stage of what this

495
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,279
action director is going to learn and

496
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:54,879
then use later on in his movies

497
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,079
so that's the beauty of it it's almost

498
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,120
like

499
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:58,798
you know

500
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,479
quentin is seeing him

501
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,720
in his generation so quentin might have

502
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,480
been the same age i was watching that

503
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,400
movie and then when he becomes a

504
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,200
director i'm at clinton's age and now

505
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,679
i'm seeing his work so some symbionic

506
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,400
relationship there and i'll end this

507
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,960
question by saying

508
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,080
hungar deals with the five animal

509
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,400
technique

510
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,918
the tiger the crane

511
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,280
right the leopard

512
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,200
the snake

513
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:26,879
uh and the dragon those are the five

514
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,160
that's the five patterns some people go

515
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,720
sevens some go 12 but let's just stick

516
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,080
to the fire pattern fist

517
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,919
how do

518
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,720
a man

519
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:40,240
emulate a tiger

520
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,440
and you see a tiger's fears

521
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,440
he curls before he spawns on you

522
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,519
how does a man emulate

523
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,279
a snake

524
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:50,798
it doesn't have to be only in the kung

525
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,119
fu move

526
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:54,558
it's in the ideology

527
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,319
of the snake

528
00:18:54,558 --> 00:19:00,000
it's in the the the agility of the crane

529
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,319
at any moment

530
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,240
sometimes punching a person

531
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,839
is not going to work

532
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,720
as they were saying leopard fists or

533
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:10,639
tiger paw so sometimes you may have to

534
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,640
poke them in the eye

535
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,200
with the crane's beak

536
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,120
so having your mind able to adapt the

537
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,360
instinct

538
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,558
of the animal when you are being

539
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,000
attacked

540
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:25,279
or when you are being the aggressor

541
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,240
that's something that you don't need a

542
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:30,720
form for that's the mentality so kung fu

543
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,798
like i said it informs me endlessly

544
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,279
because at first i was trying to learn

545
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,798
all the uh home like i can't really hit

546
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,160
you with that and really hurt you unless

547
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:40,639
i've been banging my hand a thousand

548
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,759
times on some bricks and made it so

549
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,120
callous or muscles are so strong but the

550
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:46,798
idea

551
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,119
that if me and you was to get into a

552
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,679
fight and i'm gonna tighten up on you

553
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:53,199
and take that instinct and prance when

554
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,320
i'm a prance

555
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,279
or

556
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,279
slop

557
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,119
fly away like the stalk

558
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,798
you know i mean like yo

559
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:03,439
it's this that's the mentality it's much

560
00:20:00,798 --> 00:20:06,400
more than the technical moves it's

561
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,679
it's much deeper yeah

562
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,159
yeah it's interesting i mean when i see

563
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,000
the kung fu movies because i'm uh i love

564
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:13,440
martial arts all martial arts and

565
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,759
competitive ones too like the actual

566
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,360
competitions and so on it just seems

567
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:19,038
like kung fu movies

568
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,719
go much deeper than just like the

569
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,038
techniques yeah

570
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,038
they struck i mean if you see it right

571
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,879
even i watched a great mma fight

572
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,158
recently and uh

573
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,640
just interesting

574
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,400
because he was on top of the god

575
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,679
you know

576
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:37,919
and the way he got from under him

577
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,919
you know

578
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,240
it had to be

579
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,400
you know his spirit got from under

580
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,640
some like mixture of crane and uh

581
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,519
whatever snake

582
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,600
ill either slippery ill technique yeah

583
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,079
no i love that when people are become

584
00:20:51,599 --> 00:20:56,158
artists in the cage or they that's much

585
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:57,839
bigger than just like winning much

586
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,919
bigger than particular techniques it's

587
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,519
just art especially at the highest level

588
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:02,559
competition when millions of people are

589
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,879
watching

590
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:06,000
which is pressure within itself yes yes

591
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,720
that's

592
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
art under pressure is even more

593
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,279
beautiful art

594
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,440
you know you look at some of these

595
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:16,079
fights and you wonder like why somebody

596
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,080
wins and lose

597
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:19,119
and sometimes the less talented guy

598
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:21,439
could win

599
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,038
because he could deal with the pressure

600
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,640
or the other guy he could have beat him

601
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,119
there was someone else but not in this

602
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,120
arena

603
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,400
so you're a scholar of history including

604
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:34,079
hip-hop history

605
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,840
you've uh i've listened to so many of

606
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,279
your interviews uh you've spoken

607
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,119
brilliantly about

608
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,558
some of the big figures in

609
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,239
in hip-hop history tupac biggie nas many

610
00:21:42,558 --> 00:21:47,038
others

611
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,120
maybe uh let's look at tupac and biggie

612
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,720
what made them special in the history of

613
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:52,798
music

614
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,880
that's a good question

615
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:56,000
so i don't know if i'm the authority to

616
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,200
answer it

617
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,880
but i'll just speak my piece on it and

618
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,480
maybe i could just add on because i'm

619
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,320
sure it's a lot of people that spent a

620
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,000
lot of time with them

621
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:07,678
that could speak on it but just as a

622
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,440
fellow artist

623
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,280
um

624
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,400
i think

625
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:17,359
not only was big or dope lyricists

626
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,679
i think he had a voice

627
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:21,439
that was really immaculate

628
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,600
in a sense that

629
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,720
some rappers

630
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:28,319
get on top of music and you gotta get

631
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,640
used to them or you gotta fight you know

632
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,200
you gotta vibe with them

633
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,200
but he

634
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,079
make a record sounds like a record

635
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:40,960
immediately

636
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,798
if you go back and listen to his music

637
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,360
you could take his voice and put it on

638
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:48,000
anything and for some reason

639
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,678
it sounds like a record you know i mean

640
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,038
you mean just like the raw voice of the

641
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,880
man yeah

642
00:22:51,038 --> 00:22:55,519
so you could just listen to it raw and

643
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,440
it sounds like a record yeah but if you

644
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,960
put a beat take his voice to put it on

645
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,798
any beat

646
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,319
it's he just has

647
00:23:00,798 --> 00:23:04,079
a voice

648
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:05,839
it's immaculate you know

649
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,960
so his lyrical skills and all that was

650
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,079
great

651
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,319
um and you got to think once again

652
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:15,119
he's doing all this he's not even 25

653
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:17,599
years old yeah yeah

654
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:19,519
then you go to park once again

655
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,399
immaculate voice but

656
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:25,359
what park had i think

657
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:27,679
was a way of touching us

658
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:30,798
on all of our emotions

659
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,320
and especially on like pog had the power

660
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,558
to infuse

661
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:37,119
your emotional thought like brenda has a

662
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:40,079
baby dear mama

663
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:43,199
but then he had the power to arouse

664
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:47,359
your the rebel in you

665
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,480
you know yeah and those two things

666
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:49,599
uh

667
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,640
actually

668
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:53,678
he's he was probably more dangerous

669
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,320
uh

670
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,400
than big no no choice b.i.g

671
00:23:56,319 --> 00:23:59,200
like notorious b.i.g we could party with

672
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,200
him

673
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:04,080
to this day we were still

674
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,759
but park was probably going to a point

675
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:08,000
you know he was more

676
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,679
going into the malcolm x of things and

677
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,159
yeah and and

678
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,840
and society fears that

679
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,559
yeah so he was really good at

680
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:20,000
communicating love and and

681
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,319
and at starting revolutions yeah

682
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,558
and that's dangerous very dangerous

683
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:27,839
and they communicated love

684
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:29,519
but he wasn't starting revolutions

685
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,199
well it's it's interesting to think

686
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,839
about what the world would be like if

687
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,798
they were still with us but

688
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,519
it's the way of the world hendricks

689
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:41,440
a lot of those guys just go to tucson

690
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,679
yes it's a peculiar thing you know so

691
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:47,120
now you asked me earlier

692
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,960
am i scared of death um

693
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:50,959
and i answered you know not scared of

694
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,038
death i mean i'm not trying to see it

695
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,120
though you know i mean yeah it's like

696
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,558
that was the block of death

697
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:58,719
it's like i'm not really going right

698
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:01,678
there right now i'm making a left for a

699
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,200
right turn you know i mean unless it was

700
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,278
mandatory for

701
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,440
some greaterness greater good it's like

702
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,319
okay i gotta drive through that

703
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,159
you know

704
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,558
yeah but it can still happen that's the

705
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,960
meditation on death part where you could

706
00:25:12,558 --> 00:25:17,440
die at the end of today yeah you could

707
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,960
die or death well dying and death i

708
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,480
think it's two different things

709
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,120
personally

710
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,038
um the process you mean of death or just

711
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,479
yeah i mean you could die i guess you

712
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,679
could die every day

713
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,880
you could die and not be yourself

714
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,640
you know what i mean

715
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,760
which is crazy

716
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,080
but to get to a point of no return

717
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:41,359
you know that's a whole other chamber

718
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,720
i mean there's some sense in which um

719
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,479
reza the

720
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,079
producer

721
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,679
becomes somebody else completely when

722
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:50,399
you're making a film becomes somebody

723
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,080
else completely when you're um

724
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
i don't know playing chess becomes

725
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:55,678
completely something different when you

726
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,079
uh do kung fu

727
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,000
or watch kung fu or when you're a family

728
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,240
man all of those are little deaths when

729
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,720
you transition from one place to another

730
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,400
so it's not like you're one being you're

731
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,200
you're many things

732
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,480
yeah

733
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,600
i was described now i would describe

734
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:14,000
that it's all life though

735
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:18,079
yeah it's fun

00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:20,079

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,440
i i'll name a couple more i gotta put

761
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,959
knives in that category

762
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,880
you know we got a chess board in front

763
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,840
of us and one of the greatest chess

764
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,720
players

765
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,119
uh the youngest grandmaster you know and

766
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,480
you know before i think uh

767
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:19,038
carlson

768
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,038
was uh

769
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:22,879
um bobby bobby fisher

770
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,320
all right so this is bobby fish as

771
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,559
american one of the greatest american

772
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,960
chess players of course susan pogar may

773
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:30,480
have tied his record as the youngest

774
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,840
grand master and she's the youngest

775
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:37,360
female grandmaster i think to date

776
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:39,439
but he was a master at what 14

777
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,719
yeah something like that right

778
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,759
so now

779
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,480
to me

780
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,798
i met nas when he was 15.

781
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,640
he was already a master lyricist it

782
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:51,119
takes about 10 years to become a master

783
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,640
lyricist so by the time the world heard

784
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,798
of wu-tang

785
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,759
most of us had 10 years of rapping in us

786
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,240
already

787
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,960
so that's why you you met us at mastery

788
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,599
level the jizzer was already a master

789
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,558
when nas was a master but joseph was 21.

790
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,558
the house was 15.

791
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,759
nas is like the mozart of rap

792
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,919
yeah just bobby fisher bobby fischer

793
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:17,359
just born some something in him or maybe

794
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,120
those early years just because he's uh

795
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:21,839
he's not just good at

796
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,678
the lyrics he's also he goes deep with

797
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:27,199
it yeah just like you so he's like

798
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:30,880
there's there's depth it's not just uh

799
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,159
like mastery of the the word smithing

800
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,240
it's just

801
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,440
the message you actually get

802
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
sent across

803
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,720
yeah

804
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,240
into a small

805
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,079
phrase

806
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,440
right that's the whole thing of energy

807
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:46,639
how do we condense all that energy into

808
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,320
death

809
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,840
so that it could fuel

810
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,319
that

811
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:54,000
and he's definitely one of those artists

812
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,558
emcees that does that

813
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,159
and he was doing it at 15 you know like

814
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,319
i said i'm thinking i'm five years or

815
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,640
four or five years older than us

816
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:04,398
so i was always feeling you know my

817
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,600
confidence of what i was doing but i was

818
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:10,239
like this kid is only 15.

819
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,879
i gotta step up my game yeah we got when

820
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,200
he turned 19 then we got automatic

821
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,320
yeah

822
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,319
from you

823
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,519
or what are the best and most memorable

824
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,519
lyrics you've ever written

825
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,079
well that's a hard question for me the

826
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,599
stuff stand out like stuff you're really

827
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,678
proud of that was like

828
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:32,158
important in your career

829
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:34,640
yeah i i i mean

830
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,559

on the international version

834
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:46,158
but if anybody could go get those lyrics

835
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,679
and write those lyrics down you could

836
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,679
just put that in your pocket and i'm

837
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,320
sure that it'll answer at least about 25

838
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,640
percent of your life's problems

839
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,480

848
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,200
the spark of all suggestions of

849
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,678
righteousness the pathway to the road of

850
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,080
perfection who gives you all and never

that fights every war with you before

853
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,119
the mortal view of the prehistorical

854
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:29,839
historical he's the all in all you

855
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:32,079
searching for the oracle

00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,480

you know before he had a child

877
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,080
he was more adamant

878
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,359

879
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,278

after a child he still kept his thing

882
00:31:25,839 --> 00:31:29,599
but i just hit him with the question if

883
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,359
you was about to die because now you got

884
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:33,038
a child thinking about

885
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,879
when you're thinking about yourself i

886
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:36,000
ask him if he's about to die

887
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,000
do you you don't think you're going to

888
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,398
make that call he's like

889
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,398
i'll make that call

890
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:45,038
and and it kind of inspired my lyric

891
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:47,359
because it was like yeah who you gonna

892
00:31:45,038 --> 00:31:48,640
yeah and i just want to say as far as so

893
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:51,759
you mentioned alert that is one of my

894
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,480
favorite lyrics but that's part two

895
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:55,599
to

896
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,880
sun shower was the uh prequel to

897
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,158
sunshine

898
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,320
yeah so if you ever get a chance to

899
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,000
check out sun shower

900
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:05,678
uh it starts off with

901
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:08,240
trouble follows a wicked mind 2020

902
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:11,120
vision of the prism of life but still

903
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,798
blind because you lack the inner

904
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:14,479
so every sinner could end up in the

905
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:16,720
everlasting winter

906
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,200
of hellfire

907
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,079
but thorns and splinters prick your eye

908
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,319
out you cry out your words fly out but

909
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,759
you remain unheard

910
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,960
suffering

911
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,278
internal

912
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,759
and external along with the wicked

913
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,839
fraternal of generals and colonels land

914
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,000
of thermal nuclear heats that burns you

915
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,839
firmly and permanently

916
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,359
upon the journey through the journal of

917
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,879
the book of life

918
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:44,719
for those who took a life without

919
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:46,960
justice will become just ice

920
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,558
it's been taught your worst enemy

921
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,360
couldn't harm you as much as your own

922
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:51,359
wicked thoughts

923
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:55,278
but people ought to be naught and listen

924
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,960
wrought

925
00:32:55,278 --> 00:33:00,480
so they find themselves persecuted

926
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,558
inside their own universal court

927
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,960
so that it's a long one that's like a

928
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:06,798
three-pager wow that is about life

929
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:08,558
that's like character integrity how to

930
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:10,720
be

931
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,398
yeah how to be in this world and that

932
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,600
ultimately connects to god

933
00:33:12,398 --> 00:33:15,518
yeah

934
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:16,798
who's god to you

935
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:17,519
i'm glad you just asked that question

936
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:19,599
because

937
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,880
i actually

938
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:23,678
i'm going to have to make a

939
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,120
distinguishable separation here

940
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:26,640
all right

941
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,479
um

942
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,320
and it's funny because i heard recently

943
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,159
uh

944
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:35,439
i heard a rabbi was

945
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,799
debating with uh this historian dr ben i

946
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,399
can't believe stock the band name but it

947
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,158
was debating

948
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:41,038
and in the debate

949
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,640
they

950
00:33:41,038 --> 00:33:47,440
started going back through the etymology

951
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,360
they went way back beyond antiquity

952
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,240
because they was debating so there was

953
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:54,558
you know some things they was going deep

954
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,720
and they really went far far back to

955
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,639
kind of the first word of

956
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,759
of god

957
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,960
and it was

958
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:03,919
when they pronounced it on this

959
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,038
particular debate it was allah

960
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,919
and they said for now they got elohim

961
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:09,679
um

962
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,760
i've already

963
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,440
agreed in my heart in my life

964
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:15,919
that

965
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,918
the father this universe proper name is

966
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:21,679
allah

967
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,719
um and of course in the law i get all

968
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,039
you know

969
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,118
um and i don't think that

970
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,759
god

971
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,639
is the same as that i think a law gives

972
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,639
birth to god

973
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,358
in fact if you take the word allah

974
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,358
a-l-l-a-h

975
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:42,319
and you take it through numerology or

976
00:34:39,358 --> 00:34:45,759
numbers the number a being letter a

977
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,720
being 1 l being 12 and you add it all up

978
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,119
to its

979
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,239
lowest uh to the you know the last

980
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,679
denominator you're going to get the

981
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,039
number seven

982
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,440
and the number seven is going to bring

983
00:34:53,039 --> 00:34:58,000
you right back to that letter g

984
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,119
so a law aborns god but god don't bone

985
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,880
allah

986
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:03,760
how does how does that god how does

987
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,838
allah connect to the oracle

988
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,280
the that you're you're going to be

989
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:08,239
calling for when you're laying in the

990
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,280
hospital

991
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,439
well what i was saying in that

992
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,640
particular verse was that we're looking

993
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,480
for the oracle we're looking for

994
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:16,480
somebody else or something to help us

995
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,159
that nobody can really help you

996
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,679
at the end of the day

997
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:22,639
you know

998
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,919
and we're speaking on on so now that we

999
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:25,759
i don't want to say we're speaking on

1000
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,079
religion but we're speaking on a way of

1001
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,359
life and a way of thinking

1002
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,160
uh

1003
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,559
and i've read many books of course

1004
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,358
and i could say there's no book

1005
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:36,159
that

1006
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:38,000
my

1007
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:39,279
the book that is the most strongest book

1008
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,239
i've ever read is actually the holy

1009
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,760
quran

1010
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,598
it's stronger to me than my than the

1011
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,680
bible which i read

1012
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,640
is stronger than quantum physics which

1013
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,480
i've read

1014
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:52,078
is stronger than the bhagavad-gita's

1015
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:53,440
it's just and and i read once uh a

1016
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,000
british scholar said it's the most

1017
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,280
stupidest book ever written

1018
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,599
and

1019
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,440
it doesn't make sense

1020
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,880
and i so i said oh i see why he says

1021
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,400
that though i can understand exactly why

1022
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,838
he said that as well

1023
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,358
why is that

1024
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:10,880
because the the structure of the words

1025
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,199
are just

1026
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,358
it's peculiar

1027
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,439
you know i mean but it's almost like how

1028
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,358
some people's songs you don't really

1029
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,079
know exactly what they say until years

1030
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:22,078
later yeah

1031
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,640
uh yeah you have uh actually joe rogan i

1032
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:29,280
think you talked about how uh

1033
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:31,199
a joke of dave chappelle's hit you like

1034
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,240
a long time after this so this is kind

1035
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:36,960
of like the quran it it uh i tend to

1036
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:36,959
believe that we

1037
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,960
human beings cannot possibly understand

1038
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,960
anything as big as

1039
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,920
these ideas so uh

1040
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:47,039
just

1041
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,800
i don't know do you think that

1042
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,279
like are you humble in the face of just

1043
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,680
the the immensity of it

1044
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,400
to be honest yes

1045
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:57,519
i'm humble in the face of the

1046
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,720
you can say the word of god pronounced

1047
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:01,119
words funny

1048
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:02,959
the omni the omnipotence

1049
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,320
the omniscience the

1050
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,838
magnitude

1051
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,359
i'm humbled within the face of in the

1052
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:09,679
face of allah

1053
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,920
the problem that we i may have had was

1054
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,679
that i wasn't humbled in the face of god

1055
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,920
because

1056
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:18,078
it's just a definable thing

1057
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,599
and that's why i think a lot of us and

1058
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,320
i'm saying that you know i know when we

1059
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,480
say god we're trying to say a lot like

1060
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,720
people was saying that but you're

1061
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,000
actually not saying the same thing

1062
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:30,959
because you're actually putting

1063
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,960
something beside

1064
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,880
and

1065
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,519
and that's the reason why you have all

1066
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,160
this many guards

1067
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:42,239
you can find a whole bunch of them

1068
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,480
i mean but you're not going to find many

1069
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:46,799
there's nobody beside allah

1070
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,639
i mean law is one so

1071
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,839
i know it's the whole thing but that's

1072
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:53,679
my heart is there i'm humbled by it

1073
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,559
i'm at peace with it

1074
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:59,039
uh and it doesn't take nothing or

1075
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,960
demerit anything from myself

1076
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,679
that's the beauty of it it doesn't take

1077
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,559
nothing from me from being who so if i

1078
00:38:03,679 --> 00:38:06,799
say

1079
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:08,480
if if somebody walk up your peace god i

1080
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,560
could take that because they're telling

1081
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:13,679
me that yo i'm a man of wisdom i'm a man

1082
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:15,279
of strength i'm a man of beauty

1083
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:17,679
or some attribute of that you know what

1084
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,040
i mean so it will turn into god's a rap

1085
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:20,319
there's wisdom there there's strength

1086
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:21,119
there there's beauty then we'll take

1087
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:23,200
that

1088
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,119
yeah so

1089
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,358
so wu-tang is one of the greatest

1090
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:29,519
musical artistic philosophical groups

1091
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:31,358
ever

1092
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,199
let's look hundreds of years from now

1093
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:35,598
when humans are robots or aliens or

1094
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,960
whatever that's left here they look back

1095
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,400
what do you hope they remember about

1096
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,440
wu-tang what do you hope the legacy is

1097
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,280
well

1098
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:45,679
well even if it's thousands years i hope

1099
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:47,280
we don't get rid of the humans

1100
00:38:45,679 --> 00:38:49,199
but you know look whatever happens is

1101
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:51,680
gonna happen but

1102
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:53,919
i think that uh my philosophy on it is

1103
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,919
that

1104
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,960
we're gonna

1105
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:02,000
continue to advance

1106
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,639
and continue to advance things around us

1107
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,719
but i don't see us becoming extinct well

1108
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:09,118
i mean the reason i bring up sort of

1109
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:10,559
wu-tang in that context and

1110
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,160
this is a special moment in human

1111
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:14,320
history it's like a hundred years and

1112
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,078
we've created all of this music just if

1113
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,240
you think of all the richness of music

1114
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,839
that's been created over 100 years

1115
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:21,759
it's like it's not obvious to me that

1116
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:23,679
that's not going to stop right like

1117
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,599
there's a flourishing here

1118
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:26,960
so it's it's funny because that i could

1119
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,359
see where the

1120
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,280
the book of human history is written

1121
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:33,920
there's a chapter on this period of time

1122
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:36,800
right and one of the things we did well

1123
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,480
is like all the technological innovation

1124
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,720
with like

1125
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,480
with rockets and with the internet but

1126
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:44,559
then there's also the musical innovation

1127
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,320
and film innovation right just so much

1128
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:47,759
art that's being created and wu-tang is

1129
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,280
a huge part of that

1130
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,070
so i just wonder what like if there's a

1131
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,200
few sentences written about

1132
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,800
[Laughter]

1133
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,799
it just uh

1134
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,880
makes me wonder how they remember i

1135
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,640
would hope that people

1136
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,400
no matter you know how many years are

1137
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,078
inspired by us

1138
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,358
but i will say if i could just use

1139
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:07,280
wu-tang

1140
00:40:05,358 --> 00:40:08,559
as itself

1141
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,680
so

1142
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:14,000
we we first started off the witty

1143
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,358
unpredictable

1144
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,519
talent

1145
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,598
and natural game right natural gaming

1146
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:22,400
and natural word play

1147
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,318
and then we went to

1148
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,039
the wisdom

1149
00:40:24,318 --> 00:40:28,639
of the universe

1150
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:30,880
the truth

1151
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:34,400
of allah

1152
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:37,760
for a nation of god

1153
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,280
wisdom universal truth or law nation god

1154
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,200
it's just like

1155
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,640
so this is go back to a nation of god

1156
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:48,719
let's just take the last two letters

1157
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,719
a nation of wisdom strength and beauty

1158
00:40:49,358 --> 00:40:53,440
right you know and i'm gonna go a little

1159
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:54,960
political here but not going political

1160
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,000
as we'll say we're the greatest country

1161
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,480
in the world

1162
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,000
what makes us the greatest

1163
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,679
that's to be a question we act is it our

1164
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,519
wisdom

1165
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,480
is it our strength

1166
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,079
is it our beauty now just say off the

1167
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,280
easiest answer you know it's our

1168
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:11,680
strength

1169
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,519
we got the nukes

1170
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:15,519
nobody can really you know between

1171
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,039
america and russia they said we're just

1172
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:18,639
you know they that's the argument who

1173
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:20,880
could beat them

1174
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,318
but where's the wisdom

1175
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,240
then they gonna argue well we got the

1176
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:25,920
technology

1177
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:29,279
right but then where's the beauty when

1178
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,200
there's so much suffering in the people

1179
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,200
so it's not complete the hope is that

1180
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,799
the wisdom is in the founding documents

1181
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:37,598
and the imperfect

1182
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,000
but wise founding documents of that

1183
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,039
celebrated freedom that celebrated

1184
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,599
all the ideas sort of having a lot of

1185
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:47,440
nukes having a lot of airplanes and

1186
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,280
tanks that's not

1187
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,039
that's not uh

1188
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,359
that's not important and the hope is

1189
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,519
whatever we're doing here with this

1190
00:41:53,358 --> 00:41:57,119
quote greatest country on earth that we

1191
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:59,440
preserve the ideas and help them

1192
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,960
flourish yeah you said well that's what

1193
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,880
i mean so if we could get so if you go

1194
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,440
back to the wu-tang i'm saying

1195
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,880
that's what we're striving for

1196
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:09,119
we're striving for that you know what

1197
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,519
man we started unpredictable and just

1198
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:14,838
like yeah just

1199
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,400
yeah but like got deep pretty

1200
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,358
quick

1201
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,358
i gotta talk to you bob bruce lee

1202
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:23,598
who's bruce lee to you who is he to the

1203
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:25,199
world what ideas of his

1204
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:26,559
were interesting to you

1205
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:28,719
like what

1206
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,119
you know you talk about like hendrix and

1207
00:42:28,719 --> 00:42:33,039
music bruce lee is that a martial arts

1208
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:34,720
he just seems to have changed the game

1209
00:42:33,039 --> 00:42:36,639
yeah

1210
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,000
you know i i went as

1211
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,838
i guess i don't know what the word bold

1212
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,559
is the right word to say but i went as

1213
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:45,358
bold as to say

1214
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,199
that he was a minor prophet and i got

1215
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:49,920
that concept from the holy quran where

1216
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,598
it says that we send prophets to every

1217
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,358
nation every

1218
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,119
village we don't let nobody not hear the

1219
00:42:53,358 --> 00:42:56,880
word in some form

1220
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:59,920
because it won't be fair

1221
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:02,720
and so if allah is merciful

1222
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,559
even a man who's deaf has to somehow get

1223
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:06,559
a sign i don't know if moses saw a

1224
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:08,318
burning bush it was nobody else to talk

1225
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:11,119
to so he had to talk to the bush i don't

1226
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:13,358
know it could have been the bush

1227
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,880
yeah but point being made

1228
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:17,119
it says that there are minor prophets

1229
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,280
and i see bruce lee as one of them

1230
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,079
uh because what he brought to the world

1231
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,640
through it through martial art

1232
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,480
uh was a whole shift in the dynamic of

1233
00:43:24,639 --> 00:43:28,559
thinking

1234
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,199
you know and that happens when

1235
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:34,960
certain certain entities are born but he

1236
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,960
didn't do it only in uh

1237
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:40,559
in the physical sense he was also

1238
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,599
philosophy in the same process

1239
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:43,440
uh

1240
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:46,240
and he was also

1241
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,639
striving to be the best of himself so

1242
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:50,559
you got three things going on

1243
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:54,000
i

1244
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:56,078
studied bruce lee multiple times

1245
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,318
at first of course

1246
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,318
um

1247
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:03,039
when i saw my first kung fu movie it was

1248
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,838
the fake it was it wasn't really bruce

1249
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:07,358
lee it was a few green hornet clips

1250
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:09,838
cut together

1251
00:44:07,358 --> 00:44:11,519
and then i saw a black samurai then my

1252
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:13,039
following kung fu movies was like

1253
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:16,159
fearless fighters

1254
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,358
uh the ghostly face uh

1255
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:20,078
you know to fit the double k but

1256
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:21,759
basically and phillips fighters the lady

1257
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:23,200
put the little kid on her back and flew

1258
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,800
across the ocean

1259
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:25,759
across the lake

1260
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,839
right

1261
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,079
so bruce wasn't doing that

1262
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:30,960
and then i went on to five deadly venoms

1263
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,440
and

1264
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,838
spearmen and 36 chambers and these

1265
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:39,679
movies are

1266
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:42,318
beautiful and yet they're all heightened

1267
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:43,919
bruce they're heightened beyond

1268
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:45,679
doable you're not gonna yeah it's like

1269
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:48,838
surreal they play with us the world

1270
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:51,838
that's not of this world yeah

1271
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,759
bruce played with this world so

1272
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:54,960
when i was somebody when someone i first

1273
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,640
saw bruce

1274
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:00,318
i obviously didn't think he was as good

1275
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:02,719
as these guys he can't fly

1276
00:45:00,318 --> 00:45:03,599
he's not flying in the movies right

1277
00:45:02,719 --> 00:45:04,879
um

1278
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,599
but then

1279
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:09,920
when i saw the first one i saw was the

1280
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,039
big boss which they re-titled fist to

1281
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,200
fury

1282
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,719
but then when i saw

1283
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:15,838
chinese connection

1284
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:16,639
which is

1285
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:19,199
uh

1286
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:21,199
the real festival right

1287
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,199
i saw something different there

1288
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:25,279
and i

1289
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:27,279
got enamored and then of course into the

1290
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,880
dragon right just

1291
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,800
really complete that's why my first

1292
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,358
album was

1293
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,039
into the wu tang 36 chambers of shaolin

1294
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,318
so it's into the dragon at 36 put

1295
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:38,239
together because those are the two

1296
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:39,679
epitomes

1297
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:41,919
so what happened is you know that's

1298
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,199
young me then teenage me studies him

1299
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,358
again

1300
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,559
and i realized wow look at look at his

1301
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:48,960
physicality

1302
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:50,719
look out for how he's really he's moving

1303
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,720
for real

1304
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,799
and then i studied him again wow look at

1305
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,318
what he's saying

1306
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,280
then i studied him again wow look at

1307
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:59,279
what he stands for

1308
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:05,679
which do you like in the realm of

1309
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:07,599
martial arts the the real or the surreal

1310
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:09,199
or the dance between the two

1311
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,160
yeah i'd like to dance between the two

1312
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:11,519
because

1313
00:46:10,159 --> 00:46:15,519
a moo i mean

1314
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:18,079
a movie to me is to entertain you

1315
00:46:15,519 --> 00:46:20,159
so i'm cool with

1316
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,839
obi-wan kenobi

1317
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:23,358
disappearing

1318
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:25,759
out of the cloak

1319
00:46:23,358 --> 00:46:27,598
when vader strikes him down

1320
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,079
and then i'm like yo what happened he's

1321
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,160
like run luke 1.

1322
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,920
i'm cool with that right because that's

1323
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:35,920
the imagination

1324
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,318
and the imagination gets stimulated to

1325
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,639
the point to whereas things that we saw

1326
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:43,440
imagined by an artist we strive to

1327
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,759
create in our real world thus star trek

1328
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,599
to me is just a precursor to our cell

1329
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:51,680
phones yeah

1330
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,119
so for me uh i like to mix the two

1331
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,118
yeah it's funny how the like science

1332
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,880
fiction like pushing into the impossible

1333
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,280
actually makes it realize eventually

1334
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:01,599
yeah yeah we humans like we once we see

1335
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:03,200
idea on screen no matter how wild it is

1336
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:04,559
we we're trying to make it yeah we're

1337
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:06,639
trying to make it it's when we a young

1338
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,159
kid it gets inspired and watch that be

1339
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,400
like i'm going to build that

1340
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:12,318
exactly so i don't know who's going to

1341
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,160
come with the back to the future time

1342
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:16,000
machine but uh do you have any

1343
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,679
classmates that you think that's

1344
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,199
the time machine

1345
00:47:17,679 --> 00:47:22,480
uh i thought you were going to back to

1346
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:25,358
the future like the what is it the the

1347
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,599
the hoverboard or like yeah yeah at

1348
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:29,519

1353
00:47:36,838 --> 00:47:41,519
actually it actually if you were back to

1354
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:42,318
a future fan you feel like you made it

1355
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:43,920
to

1356
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:45,440
you made it there yeah all right well

1357
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,358
now we just got to work on the on the

1358
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,960
time travel and it was cool to hear you

1359
00:47:47,358 --> 00:47:50,558
uh talk about the

1360
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,639
the master of the flying gay team today

1361
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,280
that that inspired

1362
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:57,679
the uh the lyric

1363
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,839
for the you know wu-tang clan ain't

1364
00:47:57,679 --> 00:48:02,159
nothing to f with yeah

1365
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:06,838
how does that go again

1366
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,838
or the coast world order not that

1367
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,879
i said i'd be tossing and forcing

1368
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:17,519
my style is awesome i'm causing more

1369
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:20,880
family foods than richard dawson and the

1370
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:24,800
survey said you're dead the fatal flying

1371
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,160
guillotine chops off your head yeah yeah

1372
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:28,880
and it was interesting to see the

1373
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:30,960
guillotine in in the movie today

1374
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,000
how

1375
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,400
i don't know

1376
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:35,920
that that's surreal right but it's not

1377
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,680
it's like it's an engine it's

1378
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,480
engineering it's both surreal and it's

1379
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:43,440
just and then it it uh

1380
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:45,199
it adds this chaos into this real world

1381
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,800
that and then challenges everybody think

1382
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:48,239
what you're gonna do with that yeah how

1383
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,559
you're gonna beat it yeah how you gonna

1384
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:53,519
beat it both when you have like the good

1385
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,720
and the evil and the mix of the bad guys

1386
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:56,719
and the good guys and you're not sure

1387
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:59,118
who the bad guys are it's the old

1388
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:01,358
question of good versus evil right yeah

1389
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:04,000
like you said then the question of

1390
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:05,598
who was good who was evil but

1391
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,519
they all had a similar problem when the

1392
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,000
guillotine came

1393
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,239
but in terms of the real you mentioned

1394
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,559
the godfather good and evil

1395
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:16,239
that's your favorite movie yeah

1396
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,720
what makes it great do you think the

1397
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,959
characters the study of family

1398
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:23,519
of justice of power what connects with

1399
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,119
you oh oh i mean every one of those

1400
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:27,599
themes

1401
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:30,000
connects in the real

1402
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,599
um and it connects in a cinematic way as

1403
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,119
well

1404
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:35,760
the difference i think with me and the

1405
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,800
godfather was i seen it during the

1406
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,599
period of time when my father was absent

1407
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,640
and

1408
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,318
therefore

1409
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:46,159
family structure and family values was

1410
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:47,519
actually adopted

1411
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:49,519
in my family

1412
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,039
because of that you know me and my

1413
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,960
brother devine

1414
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,480
we actually

1415
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,280
you know

1416
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,039
took so much heed to that movie and our

1417
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,720
family life

1418
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,599
and

1419
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,358
uh

1420
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,400
we kind of

1421
00:50:03,358 --> 00:50:08,480
you know we kind of mimic that family in

1422
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,240
this structure of somebody has to be the

1423
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,760
leader of the family

1424
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:12,959
even if it was the younger michael was

1425
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:14,880
younger than

1426
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,280
sonny and fragile

1427
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:19,280
you know i mean but he was worthy

1428
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,880
and my brother devon is older than me my

1429
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:22,800
brother king is older than me and it's

1430
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:24,800
funny sometimes divine calls king

1431
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,960
fragile and i know king wants the king

1432
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,960
goes

1433
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:34,879
but you're michael yeah

1434
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:38,559
and not not by choice like

1435
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,400
just by definition of that's what i am

1436
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,200
you know i

1437
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,280
and uh it's just a blessing for me

1438
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,558
to have my older sister my older

1439
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,920
brothers

1440
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:52,640
uh and my younger brothers look to me

1441
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:55,440
as uh

1442
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:57,519
just as a as a good light in the family

1443
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,280
and like i said though that movie helped

1444
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:00,960
us my sisters too we

1445
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,800
you know the cool thing about my family

1446
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,559
i don't know if i share this a lot

1447
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,599
it's a big we all watch these movies

1448
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:08,960
together

1449
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,000
and so the a diagram pole fighter master

1450
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:11,920
killer

1451
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,920
father venus my family knows these

1452
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,280
movies it's not just

1453
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,440
i know them

1454
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,760
right and then you extend it further my

1455
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,599
friends know them right too

1456
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:24,720
so there's a language

1457
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:27,200
that we all can have

1458
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:28,959
that actually film has informed our

1459
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:31,118
communication

1460
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,880
so the godfather

1461
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:36,640
you know which also is still

1462
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,838
a fictitional story of something

1463
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:40,318
but

1464
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,639
since it was based in reality based on

1465
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,480
something real and it was human it

1466
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:47,039
wasn't so heightened

1467
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:49,599
i think the purity of it

1468
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:51,920
resonates and the purity of it is

1469
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,880
something that resonates with me

1470
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,760
you know

1471
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:57,200
you got to be you got to plan ahead

1472
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,880
you know he didn't want to deal with the

1473
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:00,159
drugs

1474
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,240
but

1475
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,399
that time of business was upon him it's

1476
00:52:02,239 --> 00:52:05,759
like it's almost like

1477
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,079
this is a tough one like sometimes when

1478
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:10,880
the muslim brothers come from the middle

1479
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:12,160
east to america and they open up delhi's

1480
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,318
right

1481
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,558
they would sell him

1482
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:19,039
and we would go in there and complain to

1483
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,880
them and make them like they they just

1484
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:22,558
get mad at us when we can't

1485
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:25,519
but you know and that's as a kid but as

1486
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:27,280
a man i'm like yo he's here to sell

1487
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:30,000
now he still don't have to sell to him

1488
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,839
like like fido cody didn't want to sell

1489
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,280
the

1490
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:34,480
drugs okay he didn't have to do it he

1491
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,400
didn't do it

1492
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:38,480
and it cost him some bullets to

1493
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:42,000
eventually somebody in the family

1494
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:44,480
ended up doing it yeah

1495
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,800
what about this idea that's family

1496
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:48,719
before everything else so like you're

1497
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,720
you know there's there's different laws

1498
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:53,439
you live up

1499
00:52:50,719 --> 00:52:55,199
according to in this world and family is

1500
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:59,358
first yeah

1501
00:52:55,199 --> 00:52:59,358
that's that's that's mathematically

1502
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:01,279
i correct

1503
00:52:59,838 --> 00:53:02,960
like that

1504
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,599
i mean there's uh there's a certain

1505
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,119
sense of um

1506
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,318
you look at powerful people you look at

1507
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,400
putin

1508
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:12,079
there's a certain sense in which the

1509
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,000
people who are in the inner circle

1510
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:18,079
that's who you take care of that's

1511
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:20,719
family yeah anyone else that crosses you

1512
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,640
that you know there's a different set of

1513
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:23,759
ethics under which you operate for those

1514
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:24,719
people

1515
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,079
well

1516
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:29,759
jesus said the same thing

1517
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,800
you know when he said love thy neighbor

1518
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,559
and our brother he was talking about

1519
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:35,839
that community yeah

1520
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:38,000
when that other lady who the samaritan

1521
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,759
say hey jesus i'm not feeling my brother

1522
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,358
not feeling so well and because he said

1523
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,960
give not that which is holy unto the

1524
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:47,759
dogs if you're gonna tell a woman

1525
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,599
i'm give not that which is holy

1526
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:51,599
unto the dogs and she's a woman you just

1527
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:54,800
called her a dog

1528
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:57,039
if i translate that in hip-hop

1529
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,800
yeah female you call the dog

1530
00:53:57,039 --> 00:54:00,719
i know how that goes but she tried but

1531
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:03,280
she said to him

1532
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:05,679
but even the dog is allowed to eat the

1533
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,839
crumbs that falls from the master's

1534
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:10,159
table

1535
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:11,920
and he went helped yeah he helped now

1536
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:14,159
let's go back to what you said about

1537
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,358
putin or vito colon or myself and my

1538
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:17,679
family

1539
00:54:15,358 --> 00:54:20,159
of course the family is first

1540
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:22,799
but once the family is good

1541
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,719
it has to then spread to the community

1542
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,760
then to the

1543
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,598
state

1544
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:29,839
country world

1545
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,960
the problem we have sometimes is that

1546
00:54:29,838 --> 00:54:32,558
and this is the reason why a lot of

1547
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,800
powerful families was overthrown like

1548
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:37,200
why did they be had their own

1549
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,318
king with the guillotine right because

1550
00:54:37,199 --> 00:54:42,798
that once the family was strong

1551
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:44,159
they didn't let the

1552
00:54:42,798 --> 00:54:45,679
the wealth

1553
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:47,759
the opportunity

1554
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:48,639
expand out

1555
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,799
you know

1556
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:53,519
look at wu-tang

1557
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,719
yes our family was made strong first but

1558
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:56,559
then

1559
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,719
all the women was able to form their own

1560
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:00,240
corporations and they had their own

1561
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:02,078
sub-families

1562
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:03,039
it has to grow out and they took over

1563
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:06,240
the world

1564
00:55:03,039 --> 00:55:08,639
you've uh talked about being vegan and i

1565
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:11,199
don't think i heard you

1566
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:14,639
explain this because it connects somehow

1567
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:16,318
about how you think about life

1568
00:55:14,639 --> 00:55:18,719
so you talk about when your family is

1569
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:21,199
good you grow that like circle of

1570
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:23,039
empathy you grow the community

1571
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:24,719
is that how you think about

1572
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:25,920
being vegan

1573
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,000
that

1574
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,599
just the capacity of living beings on

1575
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,679
earth to suffer

1576
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,359
that you just don't want to

1577
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:34,558
add suffering to them

1578
00:55:33,358 --> 00:55:36,318
yeah i mean

1579
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,559
you said it clear

1580
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:40,719
it's like nothing

1581
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,480
in all reality

1582
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:44,078
i came to a realization that nothing

1583
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,079
really has to die

1584
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:48,559
for me to live yeah

1585
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:51,280
no animal the plants

1586
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,480
themselves right so let's just say

1587
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,000
you know

1588
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:55,119
you want a steak which is probably the

1589
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,719
most you know

1590
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,400
you know i don't know the most expensive

1591
00:55:56,719 --> 00:56:00,480
piece of meat but let's just say the

1592
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:02,559
steak is you know top of the line nice

1593
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,199
steak yeah and you eating the steak for

1594
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,640
the protein to help build your muscle

1595
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:08,639
and i don't know if you got it from a

1596
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:11,838
cow or a bowl but whether it's a cow or

1597
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:13,838
the ball they grow to about 1500 pounds

1598
00:56:11,838 --> 00:56:16,400
and if it's a ball it's all muscly

1599
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:19,679
muscle

1600
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,680
and it's only eating grass

1601
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:24,159
yeah

1602
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,639
yeah there's there's yeah

1603
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:28,480
it's possible to uh both as an athlete

1604
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,118
and just as a human being to perform

1605
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,960
well without meeting me that's something

1606
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,960
especially in the way we're treating

1607
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:37,599
animals

1608
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,760
to deliver that meat to the plate i

1609
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,079
think about that a lot so i i do i'm a

1610
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,400
robotics person ai person

1611
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:45,920
and i think a lot about i don't know if

1612
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,079
you think about this kind of stuff but

1613
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:49,760
building ai systems as they become more

1614
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:51,920
and more human-like

1615
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,240
you start to ask the question of are we

1616
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,240
okay

1617
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,960
if we give

1618
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,838
the capacity for ai systems to suffer

1619
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:05,679
first to feel but then to suffer

1620
00:57:01,838 --> 00:57:07,440
um to hate and to love to feel emotion

1621
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:09,279
how do we deal with that

1622
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,880
it starts asking the same questions you

1623
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:13,760
ask of animals

1624
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,599
are we are we okay adding that suffering

1625
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,799
to the world right

1626
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:19,359
and i don't think we should add the

1627
00:57:16,798 --> 00:57:22,239
suffering because it's not necessary

1628
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:23,279
like look if it's necessary right

1629
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:24,959
because we're

1630
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:27,119
you know survival or the first law of

1631
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,039
nature and self-preservation

1632
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,519
if you are in the desert and there's

1633
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,960
nothing else to eat but that lizard

1634
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:34,798
yeah yeah okay you gotta do what you

1635
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,318
gotta do melissa's gotta go yeah you

1636
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:38,639
gotta go you gotta do what you gotta do

1637
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:40,400
because at the end of the day man is

1638
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:41,679
when they say man has dominion over

1639
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:45,039
these things

1640
00:57:41,679 --> 00:57:47,279
his dominion is almost like a caretaker

1641
00:57:45,039 --> 00:57:50,159
how the way we do our dominion we

1642
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:51,920
dominate it eat it cook it yeah like who

1643
00:57:50,159 --> 00:57:53,519
who who's the first guy that looked at

1644
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,318
the lobster

1645
00:57:53,519 --> 00:57:57,519
he was like i'm going to eat this thing

1646
00:57:56,318 --> 00:57:59,440
like it's it's

1647
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:02,000
hard to eat it yeah you got to go

1648
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,240
through a process to get that a crab i

1649
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,679
remember we see crabs when we was kids

1650
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:07,279
and i didn't know why i was always

1651
00:58:05,679 --> 00:58:08,879
getting itchy throats and all that you

1652
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,280
know you care you don't know just eat

1653
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,280
but at the end of the day a crab didn't

1654
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,599
provide no more than

1655
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:17,599
a finger worth of meat maybe

1656
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,559
and it's hell getting that thing getting

1657
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,160
it out

1658
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,400
it's like it's not worth it in all

1659
00:58:20,159 --> 00:58:24,159
reality you could have gave me a

1660
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,838
you could have gave me

1661
00:58:24,159 --> 00:58:29,199
a banana

1662
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:30,719
and did better for my body

1663
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:33,759
and my appetite

1664
00:58:30,719 --> 00:58:35,679
and my being fulfilled that's full

1665
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,799
like look look at the blessings

1666
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:41,598
of of of life right

1667
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:45,119
if you take a seed

1668
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:45,119
or you get an apple and you eat it

1669
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:51,440
and that apple is multiple seeds in it

1670
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:52,880
if you plant that seed it'll give you a

1671
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,720
whole tree

1672
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,640
with a whole bunch of apples with all

1673
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:59,519
multiple seeds

1674
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,598
but if you kill a fish

1675
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:03,440
it can't reproduce done

1676
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:04,960
yeah if you kill a cat it's done it's

1677
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:06,880
not it's not they're coming back but

1678
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,119
when you deal with the plants

1679
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:11,599
even after you eat the apple

1680
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:14,240
and then you defecate

1681
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:16,480
your defecation is what feeds the ground

1682
00:59:14,239 --> 00:59:18,879
that cause the apple to grow more yeah

1683
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,400
it's a circle of life and especially

1684
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,640
there's a there's a guy named david

1685
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:24,720
foster wallace he wrote a short

1686
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:26,400
story called consider the lobster if you

1687
00:59:24,719 --> 00:59:27,679
actually think philosophically about

1688
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,559
what

1689
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:32,159
from a perspective of a lobster

1690
00:59:30,559 --> 00:59:34,079
that's like symbolic or something

1691
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:37,039
because you're basically put

1692
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:39,200
in in the water like cold water and then

1693
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:41,599
it heats up slowly

1694
00:59:39,199 --> 00:59:43,199
until until it's no more torture yeah it

1695
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,480
must have been like

1696
00:59:43,199 --> 00:59:45,679
they started eating lobsters in the

1697
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,559
inquisition

1698
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:48,480
yeah

1699
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,000
they just enjoy so they they will

1700
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,519
probably enjoy torturing animals and

1701
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,960
they realize they're also delicious

1702
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:54,719
after the torture is finished that's

1703
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:56,079
probably how they discovered it

1704
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:57,439
let me ask you a question i know you

1705
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:59,039
asked me the questions but i want to

1706
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,358
talk a little bit about the ai and you

1707
00:59:59,039 --> 01:00:04,480
said something about trying to uh put

1708
01:00:01,358 --> 01:00:06,798
the emotion in it yeah right

1709
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:06,798
um

1710
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:10,159
so do we so are you

1711
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:12,078
thinking there's an algorithm for

1712
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:13,279
emotion

1713
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:16,079
yes

1714
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:17,119
but i think emotion isn't something that

1715
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,599
there's a

1716
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:22,640
algorithm for for a particular system we

1717
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,480
create emotions together so

1718
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:26,719
emotion is something like this

1719
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:28,400
conversation it's like magic we create

1720
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:30,078
together so

1721
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:32,639
um i have i've worked with quite a few

1722
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:34,400
robots i've a very simple version of

1723
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:35,358
that i've had you know roomba vacuum

1724
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,200
cleaners

1725
01:00:35,358 --> 01:00:39,759
they're i've had them make different

1726
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:41,679
sounds and one of them is like screaming

1727
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,280
and pain like lightly and just having

1728
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:45,919
them do that when you kick them or when

1729
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,240
they run into stuff immediately

1730
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,000
i start to feel something right so the

1731
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:51,199
emotion okay so the emotion you're

1732
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,440
saying is

1733
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:55,358
impulse back on the human yeah but i'm

1734
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,960
asking do you think there's an algorithm

1735
01:00:55,358 --> 01:00:58,960
for the emotion to being post from

1736
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,960
machine to machine

1737
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:03,199
yeah that that's a really good way to

1738
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,400
ask it

1739
01:01:03,199 --> 01:01:06,318
um

1740
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:08,079
it's it's difficult because i think

1741
01:01:06,318 --> 01:01:10,239
ultimately i only know how to exist in

1742
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:12,240
the human world so it's like it's the

1743
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,159
question of if a tree falls in the

1744
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:15,279
forest nobody's there to see it does it

1745
01:01:14,159 --> 01:01:18,318
still fall

1746
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:20,720
i i still think that ultimately machines

1747
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:22,798
will have to

1748
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:24,639
show emotion to other humans and that's

1749
01:01:22,798 --> 01:01:26,400
when it becomes real i've been thinking

1750
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,159
about this a lot too

1751
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,039
and uh

1752
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:31,039
i just okay

1753
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,880
i'm not gonna come hit you with this

1754
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:36,318
because i've been thinking about this

1755
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,318
thing this is just your field yeah

1756
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:42,000
well do you think the emotion is wave

1757
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:44,480
like light is wave and or think it's

1758
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,480
particle

1759
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,760
so emotion is just a small it's like a

1760
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:52,480
shadow of something bigger and i think

1761
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,520
that bigger thing is consciousness so

1762
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:58,960
emotion is just a wave or a particle

1763
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:00,719
i haven't i haven't thought about that

1764
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,199
i have thought about it whether it's

1765
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:05,439
there's something like um

1766
01:02:03,199 --> 01:02:07,759
whether consciousness or emotion is the

1767
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:09,679
law of physics like if it's that

1768
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,480
fundamental to you i had a lyric i had a

1769
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:14,480
lyric i had a lyric that said this

1770
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:16,079
it comes out uh they did this

1771
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,920
documentary about the planet and i gave

1772
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,359
i wrote a song it's called the world of

1773
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:21,119
confusion

1774
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:22,639
and uh i'll try to paraphrase the lyrics

1775
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,480
but in the world of the confusion where

1776
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:26,318
there's so much illusions we suck the

1777
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,480
blood from the planet

1778
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:31,358
now it needs a transfusion and the

1779
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,358
redistribution of wealth

1780
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:35,038
of health

1781
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,679
and wealth of self

1782
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,520
in a deeper understanding about mental

1783
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:41,199
health

1784
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:45,199
the doctor

1785
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:47,519
prescribed the physical solution

1786
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:50,879
the psychiatrist

1787
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:53,679
wants to build a bigger institution

1788
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,000
but neither have the solution

1789
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:58,960
or the equation

1790
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:00,400
to make an instrument to measure the

1791
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:03,280
weight

1792
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,960
of the hate vibration

1793
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,400
what is the weight of

1794
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:10,159
hate

1795
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:10,160
is it heavier than the weight of love

1796
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:15,199
is it heavier

1797
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:16,400
than the weight of lead inside of a slug

1798
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,838
with just

1799
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,760
10 milligrams that's all it takes to

1800
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:22,000
kill a man but anyways they're not going

1801
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,000
from there but damn that's good but the

1802
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,239
question you see the question there yeah

1803
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,960
yeah yeah and that can be measured yeah

1804
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:31,439
can that be measured i think so i think

1805
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:33,599
so just look at the estimate yet yeah i

1806
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,679
yeah so we're in the

1807
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,240
dark ages of that but i think it could

1808
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:40,960
be measured i think there's something

1809
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,719
physical like something that connects us

1810
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,039
all this much you know we tend to think

1811
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:46,318
we humans are distinct entities and we

1812
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,720
move about this world but i think

1813
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:50,480
there's some deeper connection

1814
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:52,000
and but we're so

1815
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,240
listen

1816
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:55,760
science is in the we just had a few

1817
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:57,679
breakthroughs in the past hundred years

1818
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,720
from einstein on the theoretical physics

1819
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:00,159
side

1820
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,000
we don't know anything about human

1821
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:03,598
psychology we barely know much about

1822
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,599
human biology

1823
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:08,559
we're trying to figure it all out

1824
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:10,838
yeah i i had another theory

1825
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,760
because you know you think about

1826
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:15,440
quantum right

1827
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,079
as long as you say that there's an

1828
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:19,519
uncertainty

1829
01:04:18,079 --> 01:04:22,160
and you have me believe there's an

1830
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:24,400
uncertainty then there's uncertainty

1831
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:26,318
but if there's not an uncertainty what

1832
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,920
happens

1833
01:04:26,318 --> 01:04:29,199
so i'm only saying that it's not that

1834
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:30,720
last because you look at quantum

1835
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,519
computers they're going to give you the

1836
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,639
o

1837
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:34,000
the one

1838
01:04:32,639 --> 01:04:36,000
the one the oh they're gonna get they're

1839
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,599
gonna take two things and make it eight

1840
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,199
things and by the time you multiply four

1841
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,039
of those things together

1842
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:44,000
it's like this chess board right

1843
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:46,000
the moves goes into the millions

1844
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,920
but

1845
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,920
the thing that's introduced is the

1846
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,200
uncertainty

1847
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,838
right

1848
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:54,838
you're gonna make a move

1849
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:00,798
this you know this already

1850
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:02,000
right

1851
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:03,920
because this has

1852
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,920
been played a thousand times

1853
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,358
but sooner or later something uncertain

1854
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,159
is going to come in or

1855
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:10,159
make the next move

1856
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,240
i like the weight of these

1857
01:05:15,838 --> 01:05:19,440
they add they add the certainty

1858
01:05:18,239 --> 01:05:21,118
i think it's just like quitting

1859
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,519
unpredictable that there's something

1860
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:25,519
about uh us humans that really doesn't

1861
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:27,119
like everything to be fully predictable

1862
01:05:25,519 --> 01:05:28,798
i mean chess two

1863
01:05:27,119 --> 01:05:31,039
is uh

1864
01:05:28,798 --> 01:05:33,679
perfectly solvable there's nothing

1865
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:37,400
unpredictable about chess right i could

1866
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:37,399
agree to that because

1867
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:42,559
bobby fischer said in one of his books

1868
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:45,519
watch which i actually love what he said

1869
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:48,240
he said every game of chess

1870
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:49,519
is a draw

1871
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:51,358
yeah

1872
01:05:49,519 --> 01:05:54,480
the only way somebody wins is when one

1873
01:05:51,358 --> 01:05:54,480
of us makes a mistake

1874
01:05:54,719 --> 01:05:57,439
i mean it doesn't get any better than

1875
01:05:56,159 --> 01:05:59,199
yeah it doesn't

1876
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:00,720
what is chess

1877
01:05:59,199 --> 01:06:02,558
like how do you think about chess what's

1878
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:04,719
at the core of your interest in chess do

1879
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,480
you see kung fu

1880
01:06:04,719 --> 01:06:08,879
music film

1881
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,679
all of it life all just living through

1882
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,000
chess

1883
01:06:09,679 --> 01:06:16,639
yeah i see i it's the most stimulating

1884
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,960
passage of time for me

1885
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:21,598
that's also

1886
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:23,039
it's a it's like it's a pastime

1887
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,200
that stimulates

1888
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,440
my mind my music

1889
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:29,199
my thoughts about life at the same time

1890
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,039
so while some past times it's like say

1891
01:06:29,199 --> 01:06:32,399
baseball is watch it's a pastime and

1892
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,880
baseball can stimulate you depending on

1893
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,318
how you look at it right but most likely

1894
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,318
you're not going to get

1895
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:39,759
this much brain activation this much

1896
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:42,558
calculation

1897
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,640
and this much thinking about yourself

1898
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:46,640
in the game of baseball be i mean the

1899
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:47,598
player maybe but not the

1900
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:49,598
viewer

1901
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:50,798
chess is something that i can engage in

1902
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,400
to

1903
01:06:50,798 --> 01:06:56,960
and even though it's a pastime

1904
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:58,960
it's giving me all the stimulation of

1905
01:06:56,960 --> 01:07:01,119
real time in my life

1906
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:03,760
it's funny because it's also

1907
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,720
it's a funny game because it's connected

1908
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:06,799
through

1909
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:07,679
centuries of play

1910
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:09,440
just

1911
01:07:07,679 --> 01:07:10,879
some of the most interesting people in

1912
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:13,358
the history of the world have played

1913
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:15,200
this game and have struggled

1914
01:07:13,358 --> 01:07:17,358
with whatever have projected their

1915
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:19,118
struggles onto the chess board and

1916
01:07:17,358 --> 01:07:21,199
thought and the nations have fought over

1917
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,720
the chess board right right the soviet

1918
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:24,480
union versus the united states bobby

1919
01:07:22,719 --> 01:07:26,318
fischer represented the united states

1920
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,679
basket representative

1921
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:30,400
yeah

1922
01:07:27,679 --> 01:07:32,318
i gotta uh before i lose track of it

1923
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:35,519
when we were talked about the godfather

1924
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:37,038
you were an american gangster great film

1925
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:38,960
uh you said it's one of your favorites

1926
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:41,760
too what um

1927
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:44,079
you were in it with denzel washington

1928
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:45,760
what makes that movie meaningful to you

1929
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,039
what what uh

1930
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:49,200
what was it like making that movie

1931
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,799
because it was a great great america

1932
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:52,719
that was a great american film there was

1933
01:07:50,798 --> 01:07:54,719
so many things in that film being a part

1934
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:56,959
of that film was probably

1935
01:07:54,719 --> 01:07:58,480
a blessing and a treasure

1936
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,159
uh because even if i even if i wasn't a

1937
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:03,119
part of it uh

1938
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:06,639
it this course such great filmmaking and

1939
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,680
and to me a really cool great story

1940
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:09,598
um

1941
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:12,639
the thing that i

1942
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,240
love about it the most

1943
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:17,358
really is

1944
01:08:14,239 --> 01:08:17,358
the process of it

1945
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,880
you know which part of the process i

1946
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:22,400
wouldn't have known the process if i

1947
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,880
wasn't part of it

1948
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:27,838
so as a film joyous it was great feeling

1949
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:30,798
but even the process of making it

1950
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:33,039
was like a high level education for me

1951
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:35,519
on multiple levels i'm working with

1952
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:37,679
ridley scott

1953
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,040
which is and this is a bold statement if

1954
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:41,440
i say this here cuz i got a lot of

1955
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:43,439
friends that's gonna probably

1956
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:46,000
but he's probably the best living

1957
01:08:43,439 --> 01:08:46,000
director

1958
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:49,440
because

1959
01:08:47,838 --> 01:08:52,559
watching him

1960
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:54,479
allow me to understand a principle that

1961
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,080
i've coined to him and i don't know if

1962
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:59,278
people use it yet

1963
01:08:56,079 --> 01:08:59,278
called multi-vision

1964
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:03,920
he

1965
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:04,839
seems to have the capacity

1966
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,399
to

1967
01:09:04,838 --> 01:09:08,158
see

1968
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:10,158
eight

1969
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:12,399
things at one time i heard on robin hood

1970
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:13,198
he had 18 cameras i wasn't there for

1971
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:15,039
that

1972
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,519
and i think he keeps him all in his mind

1973
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:20,158
just see i seen him do it

1974
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:23,199
when he went to the monitors with the

1975
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:26,399
video playback guy yeah i seen him bring

1976
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:30,000
everything back to to a point

1977
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:32,798
but nothing was the same on the frame

1978
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:36,319
he was already there yeah and he knew if

1979
01:09:32,798 --> 01:09:39,759
he had what he was or not

1980
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:42,239
and he placed the cameras there

1981
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:43,119
and he and he he saw it like in his own

1982
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:45,919
way

1983
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:48,719
and i peeped it

1984
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,719
you know i peep this yeah and i said yo

1985
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:52,000
and i just you know humbly asked him he

1986
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,079
was like

1987
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:55,439
he was gracious enough to speak to me

1988
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:57,679
and talk to me

1989
01:09:55,439 --> 01:10:00,079
uh and and confirm

1990
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:02,079
of what i thought i saw he confirmed it

1991
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:05,198
he confirmed it and i was able to

1992
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:08,000
utilize it as i'm a filmmaker now

1993
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:10,399
and i'm i see i can at least see three

1994
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,238
or four things i can't see eight yet i'm

1995
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:14,079
i'll be there though

1996
01:10:12,238 --> 01:10:15,759
um but i could definitely

1997
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:19,359
like even right now

1998
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:20,960
just if i could go like this in the room

1999
01:10:19,359 --> 01:10:23,759
okay

2000
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,760
i got it now i got like

2001
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:28,159
how to make this right here which is

2002
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,039
just us all sitting how do i make this

2003
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:32,719
look boom

2004
01:10:31,039 --> 01:10:34,719
come on on him there's a story there

2005
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:36,960
it's a story there and i might just go

2006
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:39,198
off his hanging watch or his hanging

2007
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:40,960
wristband yeah you know because there's

2008
01:10:39,198 --> 01:10:42,719
something else there too is he dead we

2009
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:45,679
don't know exactly

2010
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:47,840
so so he has this

2011
01:10:45,679 --> 01:10:50,239
and even though this is the scene yeah

2012
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:51,440
you keeping that in mind all of this in

2013
01:10:50,238 --> 01:10:52,718
mind yeah

2014
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:54,879
what about like

2015
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:56,640
can you give an inkling of other parts

2016
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,400
of the process like the editing like

2017
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:01,119
where does the matter happen another

2018
01:10:58,399 --> 01:11:02,960
thing pedro i don't pronounce pedro last

2019
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,800
name right he's a he's a cool guy i had

2020
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:07,119
a chance to play rugby with him he was

2021
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,159
on was he on my team yeah well we went

2022
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:09,599
both teams

2023
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:13,839
but pedro

2024
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,440
the editor who you know edited many

2025
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:16,800
great films

2026
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:18,079
once again

2027
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,480
he

2028
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:20,479
has

2029
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:26,719
i will call deciphering power

2030
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:29,039
but a good editor is a decipher almost

2031
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:32,560
like breaking the enigma

2032
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:33,840
because he's dealing with

2033
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,080
thousands

2034
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:37,440
or we'll call it a film with millions of

2035
01:11:36,079 --> 01:11:40,479
feet of film at least a million feet of

2036
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:42,799
film that's a lot of film before feature

2037
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:45,359
he's dealing with that

2038
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:46,880
but he's dealing with multiple cameras

2039
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:48,559
yeah

2040
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,800
so it ain't like it's like two cameras

2041
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:51,760
he got an a b and he could just go back

2042
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,079
no

2043
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:55,039
he may have six cameras and he has to go

2044
01:11:54,079 --> 01:11:58,399
back and

2045
01:11:55,039 --> 01:12:02,960
deal with that process and you know what

2046
01:11:58,399 --> 01:12:04,719
he knows how to tell the story again

2047
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,840
and he proved it

2048
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:10,800
on american gangster as me being a

2049
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:12,640
witness because it's so much information

2050
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,760
it's even when they when the brothers

2051
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,000
all started getting their little

2052
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:19,360
business and he put one in the bronx

2053
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:21,679
and he just captured every neighborhood

2054
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:23,198
within one minute

2055
01:12:21,679 --> 01:12:24,880
and you knew what would happen you knew

2056
01:12:23,198 --> 01:12:25,678
you knew it all you knew you saw the

2057
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,359
whole

2058
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:28,880
rise of fame so you watched the palmer

2059
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:31,359
in scarface

2060
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:34,000
uh who does it in two minutes

2061
01:12:31,359 --> 01:12:35,759
uh but it's only one character

2062
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,600
so you see him go to the bank he drops

2063
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:39,440
the money off you see him by the lion

2064
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,199
you see him against his wife or the

2065
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,279
tiger you see him gets his wife you see

2066
01:12:41,198 --> 01:12:44,960
all that and then it ends on the big

2067
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:46,479
side of him in the big house with all

2068
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:48,960
the tv screens

2069
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:50,639
and you've seen him go through it right

2070
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:53,039
but in american gangster you're going to

2071
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:56,159
tell that story of rising but you also

2072
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:58,560
got to include these five brothers yeah

2073
01:12:56,158 --> 01:13:00,719
and so that's all in the edit oh man but

2074
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:02,320
also all in the director knowing that as

2075
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,760
well

2076
01:13:02,319 --> 01:13:05,039
and you got to keep track you got to

2077
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,440
keep thinking about them because that

2078
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:08,960
was a story right there yeah while i was

2079
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:11,599
hearing it i don't know if they was

2080
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,719
taking pictures of them or

2081
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,199
everybody's having a little party over

2082
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:16,560
here yeah chess i think

2083
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:19,439
yeah i like it

2084
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:19,440
they're playing chess

2085
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,560
this is great

2086
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:24,319
um

2087
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,239
you uh you said that

2088
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:28,319
you were always an old soul and see the

2089
01:13:26,238 --> 01:13:29,359
world as if you're 200 years old i like

2090
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,119
this thing

2091
01:13:29,359 --> 01:13:33,839
because your creative vision allows you

2092
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,439
to see the final piece you've created or

2093
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,920
you're creating very quickly quicker

2094
01:13:35,439 --> 01:13:37,919
than others

2095
01:13:38,238 --> 01:13:42,639
i i heard that as if you've almost like

2096
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:44,800
lived many lives you have this

2097
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:47,520
experience that allows you to see the

2098
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,520
vision so let me ask you on creativity

2099
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:50,560
where does this creativity behind reza

2100
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,920
come from

2101
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,199
this both musically and film-wise

2102
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:57,359
that i don't i don't know if i have the

2103
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:59,839
answer to that one right but is it no

2104
01:13:57,359 --> 01:14:02,000
seriously where does it come

2105
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:04,079
only thing i could say about that is

2106
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:07,679
that for some

2107
01:14:04,079 --> 01:14:09,198
reason it seems endless

2108
01:14:07,679 --> 01:14:10,640
and that's

2109
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:13,519
peculiar

2110
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:16,000
when i think about it myself

2111
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:17,360
because i was taught

2112
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:19,840
a lot of

2113
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:21,920
things from the gizza you know

2114
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,719
he introduced me to mathematics

2115
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,719
he introduced me to hip-hop itself

2116
01:14:24,719 --> 01:14:27,920
to break dancing

2117
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,158
you know i got other cousins that

2118
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,800
introduced me to graffiti

2119
01:14:30,158 --> 01:14:35,439
uh the cousins that introduced me to

2120
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:37,520
dj and like i realized that i had a lot

2121
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:38,719
of introductions but the judges are

2122
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:39,760
definitely

2123
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:42,399
you know

2124
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:44,320
my older cousin gave me a lot of

2125
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:45,920
early inspirations

2126
01:14:44,319 --> 01:14:47,840
and

2127
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,039
not saying that

2128
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:51,760
he's not

2129
01:14:49,039 --> 01:14:53,279
creative as creative as he was

2130
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:54,640
then or now

2131
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:59,279
i just since

2132
01:14:54,640 --> 01:15:02,480
like the wide span of creativity

2133
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:03,679
i don't see him doing that right

2134
01:15:02,479 --> 01:15:04,799
and

2135
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,158
i don't see

2136
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,400
my cut you know the cousins that taught

2137
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:11,920
me how to dj i didn't see them

2138
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:13,039
move from dj into making the beast

2139
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:16,079
you know

2140
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:18,560
my cousin that uh

2141
01:15:16,079 --> 01:15:20,319
you know who actually got me into

2142
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,920
instruments

2143
01:15:20,319 --> 01:15:23,920
i didn't see him

2144
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,520
leave funk and rock

2145
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:27,359
he didn't call like i'm an orchestra

2146
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:29,199
composer now yeah

2147
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,319
so

2148
01:15:29,198 --> 01:15:32,639
so

2149
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:34,399
i just said to myself i just accept

2150
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:36,960
myself

2151
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:38,719
as a artist as a creative artist that's

2152
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,719
what i am i got

2153
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:42,399
that i have to accept that now where it

2154
01:15:40,719 --> 01:15:44,640
comes from

2155
01:15:42,399 --> 01:15:46,158
i don't know if i was just trying to try

2156
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:47,520
to say where it comes from like hey give

2157
01:15:46,158 --> 01:15:50,479
it give me give me give me some type of

2158
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,840
answer i'll say from life itself

2159
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:53,439
but what does it feel like because you

2160
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:56,159
mentioned during this pandemic for

2161
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,759
example for some reason more came to you

2162
01:15:56,158 --> 01:15:59,519
in terms of writing

2163
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:02,560
and so do you feel like you're just

2164
01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,360
receiving signals from elsewhere or

2165
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,039
like

2166
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,119
do you feel like it's hard work or

2167
01:16:05,039 --> 01:16:09,760
you're just waiting

2168
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:12,399
wow it's not even waiting or no is it

2169
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:14,400
hard work it's almost like i said in one

2170
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:17,198
of my other lyrics this is for the mc

2171
01:16:14,399 --> 01:16:19,519
part of it i said emceeing to me as easy

2172
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:21,519
as breathing

2173
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,120
so it's like breathing yeah it's just

2174
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,800
like

2175
01:16:23,119 --> 01:16:26,479
in fact there's actually a scientific

2176
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:28,000
scientific thing i read about that now

2177
01:16:26,479 --> 01:16:29,119
that you might be nanny said that you

2178
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,920
heard this i know you've had to hear

2179
01:16:29,119 --> 01:16:32,719
this

2180
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,719
they say that

2181
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,719
you know

2182
01:16:34,399 --> 01:16:40,639
the atoms in our atmosphere

2183
01:16:36,719 --> 01:16:42,319
which seem to be infinite in number

2184
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:44,400
are not infinite in the space they

2185
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:48,158
occupy

2186
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:50,799
how can they in our atmosphere

2187
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:52,960
and so there's a chance

2188
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,039
that at least one million atoms that you

2189
01:16:52,960 --> 01:16:58,319
breathed in your life

2190
01:16:55,039 --> 01:17:00,319
was breathed by galileo

2191
01:16:58,319 --> 01:17:02,719
you heard this before all right yeah

2192
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,079
okay

2193
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:05,279
it's very accurate

2194
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:09,119
okay

2195
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:09,119
how does your body digest it

2196
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:14,080
well let's start at the fact that most

2197
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:15,039
of the atoms

2198
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:16,719
in our

2199
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:19,840
what that we're made of is from like

2200
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:21,920
stars right from stars bursts so like

2201
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:23,679
we're all really connected fundamentally

2202
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,000
somehow and then they get the atoms that

2203
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:27,920
make up our body come and leave and the

2204
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,399
same with the cells that are in our body

2205
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,920
they die and are reborn and we don't pay

2206
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:33,198
attention to any of that that all just

2207
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:34,640
goes through us

2208
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:36,879
i don't know

2209
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,880
that

2210
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,479
that makes me feel

2211
01:17:39,119 --> 01:17:43,359
like

2212
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:45,759
i'm not an individual i'm just

2213
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:47,439
a finger of something much bigger some

2214
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,600
much bigger organism

2215
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:50,960
well because you're drinking the coffee

2216
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:54,079
there yeah

2217
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,719
right you're going to digest that

2218
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:57,840
you're going to digest those atoms

2219
01:17:56,719 --> 01:18:00,079
whether you're going to put them through

2220
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,760
the bowel or through the urination it's

2221
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:04,000
coming out or maybe you'll sweat it out

2222
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,760
yeah you might sneeze it out yeah but

2223
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,520
they're going to make their way out how

2224
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:10,000
do you digest the atoms if you just

2225
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:12,880
breathe in galileo

2226
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,479
right how and that's what i think a

2227
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,239
artist does

2228
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:17,599
i think something in the artist it's

2229
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:18,959
like some people eat things and they're

2230
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,840
going to gain weight some people ain't

2231
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,840
going in the game but they're going to

2232
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,600
gain muscle

2233
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:27,360
my i'm just giving an analogy here i'm

2234
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:29,920
thinking that the artist breathes in and

2235
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:31,599
translates it into the art first they

2236
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,760
got to hear it i think most of us don't

2237
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:35,280
hear that like don't

2238
01:18:33,760 --> 01:18:37,440
we receive it but it's just this right

2239
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:40,719
it's not yeah we not have the frequency

2240
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:42,399
i said this to about artists and even

2241
01:18:40,719 --> 01:18:44,000
you know new york consider ourselves

2242
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:47,119
artists in a certain way but not you

2243
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:49,039
know but let's just say

2244
01:18:47,119 --> 01:18:51,840
there's only

2245
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:54,840
one million artists in the world yeah

2246
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:54,840
good

2247
01:18:57,439 --> 01:19:01,759
if you divide that into the population

2248
01:19:00,399 --> 01:19:04,479
what would that what what part of the

2249
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,239
table would it be a tiny part yeah it

2250
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:07,198
might be that right

2251
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:09,359
yeah

2252
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:11,359
um and yeah it's that

2253
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:12,719
that inspires that

2254
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,839
oh yeah you know what's so crazy about

2255
01:19:12,719 --> 01:19:15,679
that though

2256
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,920
there's also a chance i'm just going

2257
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:19,920
numbers and i'm just hypothesizing with

2258
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:22,319
you but there's also a chance that all

2259
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:26,399
of this

2260
01:19:22,319 --> 01:19:26,399
is actually informing that yeah

2261
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,679
the artist is just watching this all of

2262
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:32,880
this

2263
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:34,480
all the the chaos of this yeah so it's

2264
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:36,640
hard to know where the beauty comes from

2265
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,639
is it the artist or the chaos from the

2266
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,400
so i just so i said i don't know i don't

2267
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,159
have the answer but i if i was to be

2268
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:44,238
forced to say or something you're not

2269
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:46,399
twisting my arm but yeah i would say i

2270
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,238

yeah yeah life

2273
01:19:51,439 --> 01:19:55,359
in the tao of wu you write

2274
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:58,560
something about confusion which i really

2275
01:19:55,359 --> 01:20:00,719
like confusion is a gift from god

2276
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:02,800
those times when you feel most desperate

2277
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:05,920
for a solution sit

2278
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:08,639
wait the information will become clear

2279
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:10,800
the confusion is there to guide you

2280
01:20:08,639 --> 01:20:12,239
seek detachment and become the producer

2281
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,920
of your life

2282
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:15,519
so i gotta ask you

2283
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:17,199
advice

2284
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:19,520
if uh

2285
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:21,439
if a young person today in high school

2286
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:23,199
college is looking for some advice what

2287
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:25,198
advice could you give them

2288
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:29,039
to be a producer of a life they can be

2289
01:20:25,198 --> 01:20:29,039
proud of read the dowels

2290
01:20:29,198 --> 01:20:33,279
let's start with the wu tang manual

2291
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:35,279
first yeah no you gonna do that second

2292
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:37,759
second yeah i think you could read the

2293
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:39,679
dial roof first and then do the manual

2294
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,199
because the manual

2295
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:42,719
is that's not not to pick the two books

2296
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:45,359
against each other but the manual is

2297
01:20:42,719 --> 01:20:47,198
talking about things that is so deeply

2298
01:20:45,359 --> 01:20:49,519
connected to the music

2299
01:20:47,198 --> 01:20:51,678
and the people and the dow wu goes

2300
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:54,000
beyond goes beyond that so i would

2301
01:20:51,679 --> 01:20:55,440
actually start

2302
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:57,600
there

2303
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:58,879
which is not normally what happens i

2304
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:00,719
always tell people started knowledge

2305
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,719
then go to wisdom yeah but since the

2306
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,158
style skip ahead to the wisdom i like it

2307
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:06,560
yeah i think for the for that for a

2308
01:21:04,158 --> 01:21:09,119
young man in uh high school go to the

2309
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:10,880
dao of wu and then go back it's just

2310
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:12,639
like sometimes uh

2311
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:14,480
you know you have you know like my my

2312
01:21:12,639 --> 01:21:18,239
son's generation they had to watch the

2313
01:21:14,479 --> 01:21:19,678
other the second round of star wars yeah

2314
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:21,119
they go back you know i mean this

2315
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:23,359
generation is watching

2316
01:21:21,119 --> 01:21:24,319
the force awakens and then they go back

2317
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:26,880
yeah

2318
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:28,559
but what um

2319
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:31,679
because if you just look at your life as

2320
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,840
an example that's one heck of a life

2321
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:35,359
there's very few lives like it you've

2322
01:21:33,840 --> 01:21:38,400
created some of the most incredible

2323
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:39,920
things artistically in this world like

2324
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:42,479
if somebody

2325
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,719
you talk about that like one million

2326
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:47,599
right at the corner of the table if

2327
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:48,960
somebody once strives dreams to become

2328
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:50,320
one of those

2329
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,760
how do they do it

2330
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:53,679
well

2331
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:56,800
the beautiful thing is that there are

2332
01:21:53,679 --> 01:21:58,158
footprints left by those who've done it

2333
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,239
you know

2334
01:21:58,158 --> 01:22:02,879
and

2335
01:22:00,238 --> 01:22:04,559
the best way is to study that to study

2336
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:06,880
those who've already done what you want

2337
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,880
to do

2338
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,560
you know we

2339
01:22:08,639 --> 01:22:12,560
you know we live on the civilizations we

2340
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,960
say this is the greatest country

2341
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:17,039
in the world but our sale is a pyramid

2342
01:22:14,960 --> 01:22:18,399
with an eye on it

2343
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:19,519
you know i mean because they did it

2344
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:21,439
before

2345
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:24,239
and they you know they may have failed

2346
01:22:21,439 --> 01:22:26,879
for some reason or something happens but

2347
01:22:24,238 --> 01:22:29,198
it was just a strong enough example

2348
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,359
right to take us further you know elon

2349
01:22:29,198 --> 01:22:32,479
musk is sitting here trying to do better

2350
01:22:31,359 --> 01:22:34,000
than what the

2351
01:22:32,479 --> 01:22:36,000
rocket builders did before he's not the

2352
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,439
first one to build the rocket

2353
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,880
he's not the first guy to think of the

2354
01:22:37,439 --> 01:22:41,279
electric car

2355
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:43,199
he's doing it better he's advancing it

2356
01:22:41,279 --> 01:22:45,439
to the point that

2357
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:47,599
whoever picks up after him maybe they'll

2358
01:22:45,439 --> 01:22:48,399
get to that flying car

2359
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,000
so

2360
01:22:48,399 --> 01:22:51,198
that's the beauty

2361
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:53,119
uh

2362
01:22:51,198 --> 01:22:55,919
there's a good verse i love finding

2363
01:22:53,119 --> 01:22:58,800
verses to say things to confirm because

2364
01:22:55,920 --> 01:23:00,079
this way people could take it verbally

2365
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:02,079
physically and then maybe even

2366
01:23:00,079 --> 01:23:03,519
spiritually but krsna's just said a

2367
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:06,559
verse he said

2368
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,719
the fastest way to heaven is by spending

2369
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:10,639
time or studying the wise people meaning

2370
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:13,039
the wise people who is living and those

2371
01:23:10,639 --> 01:23:15,359
who live before you

2372
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:17,519
study the masters yeah let me ask you a

2373
01:23:15,359 --> 01:23:18,639
big perhaps ridiculous question but give

2374
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:20,080
it a shot

2375
01:23:18,639 --> 01:23:22,960
what is the meaning of this whole thing

2376
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:25,039
what's the meaning of life

2377
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:27,840
the big question i'm not going to rush

2378
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:27,840
into the answer

2379
01:23:31,198 --> 01:23:34,799
i'm going to give you somebody else

2380
01:23:32,319 --> 01:23:37,840
answer first and i'll give you my answer

2381
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:39,760
i remember asking this

2382
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,079
and uh

2383
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:43,280
you know i was 15 16 years old one of

2384
01:23:42,079 --> 01:23:45,920
the brothers

2385
01:23:43,279 --> 01:23:47,679
you know was studying in mathematics

2386
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:50,480
and

2387
01:23:47,679 --> 01:23:51,359
the letter i itself

2388
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:53,439
was

2389
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:55,198
means i

2390
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:57,599
islam

2391
01:23:55,198 --> 01:23:58,879
i mean in the individual

2392
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:00,800
right

2393
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:02,800
being a total

2394
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,239
accord with islam

2395
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,960
let me just finish this then they took

2396
01:24:04,238 --> 01:24:08,559
the word islam and they defined it

2397
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:11,279
that islam

2398
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:13,120
is an arabic word

2399
01:24:11,279 --> 01:24:15,439
for peace

2400
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:17,359
then they said peace

2401
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:20,079
is the absence

2402
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:21,599
of confusion

2403
01:24:20,079 --> 01:24:22,880
okay

2404
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,480
so

2405
01:24:22,880 --> 01:24:25,760
then they took this this is something

2406
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:27,198
that really hit me when i was and i

2407
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,280
never forgot it and i

2408
01:24:27,198 --> 01:24:31,119
i'm going to decipher it but then they

2409
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:33,359
took the word islam

2410
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:35,760
and they broke it down by the letter

2411
01:24:33,359 --> 01:24:37,119
into a acronym like casual everything

2412
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,480
around me

2413
01:24:37,119 --> 01:24:42,840
and they broke it down to i

2414
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:45,759
stimulate

2415
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:48,400
light and matter

2416
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,400
and i was like

2417
01:24:48,479 --> 01:24:52,158
because what hit me is that if you're

2418
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:55,039
not here

2419
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:57,119
then light and matter don't exist to you

2420
01:24:55,039 --> 01:24:59,039
so you're stimulating it

2421
01:24:57,119 --> 01:25:00,800
or they ain't here for you

2422
01:24:59,039 --> 01:25:03,760
so anyway taking all that so then i said

2423
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:06,159

2424
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,639

2427
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,639

2428
01:25:13,279 --> 01:25:16,880

2429
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:20,639

01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:22,319
and matter i love that that's powerful

2431
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,639
and let me give you my definition of

2432
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:24,639
life

2433
01:25:24,880 --> 01:25:28,719
i think life

2434
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:30,800
is that simple

2435
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:33,279

01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:44,320
i don't think there's a better way to

2441
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:47,119
