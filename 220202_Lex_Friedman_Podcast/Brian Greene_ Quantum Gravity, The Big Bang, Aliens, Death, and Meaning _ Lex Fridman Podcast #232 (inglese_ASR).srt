00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:06,960
brian greene theoretical physicist at

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,599
columbia and author of many amazing

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,120
books on physics including his latest

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,440
until the end of time mind matter and

6
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,800
our search for meaning in an evolving

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:19,039
universe

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,039
this is the lex friedman podcast to

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,519
support it please check out our sponsors

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,118
in the description and now here's my

11
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:29,118
conversation with brian green

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,599
in your most recent book until the end

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:34,880
of time you quote bertrand russell from

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,520
a debate he had about god in 1948

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,520
he says quote

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,559
so far as scientific evidence goes the

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,399
universe has crawled by slow stages to

18
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,640
somewhat pitiful result

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,679
on this earth and is going to crawl by

20
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,399
still more pitiful stages to a condition

21
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,159
of universal death

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,879
if this is to be taken as evidence of

23
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:59,919
purpose i can only say that the purpose

24
00:00:56,878 --> 00:01:02,159
is one that does not appeal to me i see

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:04,558
no reason therefore to believe in any

26
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,118
sort of god

27
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,200
that's quite a depressing statement as

28
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,200
you say this is a bleak outlook on our

29
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,920
universe and the emergence of human

30
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,920
consciousness so let me ask

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,920
what is the more hopeful perspective to

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,118
take on the story

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,079
well i think the more hopeful

34
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,879
perspective is to more fully

35
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:26,560
understand

36
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,239
what was driving bertrand russell to

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,478
this perspective

38
00:01:28,239 --> 00:01:32,560
and then to see it within

39
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,879
a broader context

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,560
and really that's in some sense what

41
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:38,560
what my book until the end the time is

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,040
all about but

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,960
in brief i would say that there's a lot

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,399
of truth to what bertrand russell was

45
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:46,158
saying there when you look at the second

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,239
law of thermodynamics which is the

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,479
underlying scientific idea that's

48
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,759
driving this notion that everything's

49
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:56,399
going to wither decay fall apart yeah

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,000
that's true second law of thermodynamics

51
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,519
establishes that

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,799
disorder entropy in aggregate is always

53
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,879
on the rise and that is indeed

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,560
interpretable as disintegration and

55
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:12,400
destruction over sufficiently long time

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,800
scales but my view is when you recognize

57
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,520
how special that makes us

58
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,760
that we are these exquisitely ordered

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,239
configurations of particles that only

60
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:25,679
will last for a blink of an eye in

61
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,280
cosmological time like terms the fact

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,159
that we're here and we can do what we do

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,919
to me

64
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,639
that's just

65
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:34,000
really something that inspires gratitude

66
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,279
and wonder

67
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,400
and and a sense of of deep

68
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,120
purpose by virtue of being these unique

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,280
collections of entities that happen to

70
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,039
rise up look around and try to figure

71
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,479
out where we are and what the heck we

72
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:50,239
should do with our time

73
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:51,679
so it's not that i would disagree with

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,000
burch and russell

75
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,200
in terms of the

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,318
basic

77
00:02:55,199 --> 00:03:00,399
physics and the basic unfolding but i

78
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:04,238
think it's really a matter of the slant

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,360
that you take on what it means for us

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,360
so maybe

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,959
we'll skip around a bit but let me ask

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,440
the biggest possible question then you

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,400
said purpose so what's the meaning of it

84
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,120
all then

85
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,158
is uh is there a meaning to life that we

86
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
can

87
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,079
take from this

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,280
from this brief

89
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,000
emergence of complexity that arises from

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,400
simple things and then goes into

91
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,560
a heat death that is once again returns

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,039
to simple things as the march of the

93
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,719
second law the thermodynamics goes on i

94
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:36,479
think there is but i don't think it's a

95
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,479
universal answer

96
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,719
and so i think throughout

97
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,199
the ages there has been

98
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:44,318
a kind of quest for

99
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:47,039
some

100
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:49,439
final way of articulating meaning and

101
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,798
purpose whether it's god

102
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,799
whether it's love whether it's

103
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,480
companionship i mean many people put

104
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,560
forward different ways of

105
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:59,518
taking this question on

106
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,158
and there is no one right answer when

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,280
you recognize deeply

108
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:07,120
that the universe doesn't care there is

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,280
nothing out there

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,840
that is the final answer it's not as

111
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,840
though we need a more powerful telescope

112
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,358
and somehow if we can look deeply into

113
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,199
the universe all will become clear in

114
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:21,358
fact the deeper we've looked both

115
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,520
literally and metaphorically

116
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:27,039
into the universe and into the structure

117
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:30,639
of reality the more it's become clear

118
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,520
that we are just a momentary byproduct

119
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,160
of

120
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:35,439
laws of physics that don't have any

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,680
emotional

122
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,519
content they don't have any intrinsic

123
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,918
sense of meaning or purpose

124
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,918
and when you recognize that you realize

125
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:44,959
that searching for the universal for

126
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:46,159
this kind of

127
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,279
a question

128
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,759
is a fool's errand every individual has

129
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,319
the capacity to make their own meaning

130
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,759
to set their own purpose and that's not

131
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:59,680
some platitude that is what we are

132
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,520
because there is no fundamental answer

133
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,079
it's what you make of it and however

134
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:08,159
much that may sound like a hallmark card

135
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:09,758
this really is the deep lesson of

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,600
physics and science more generally over

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,560
the past few hundred years well there's

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,400
some level where you can objectively say

139
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,918
that whatever we've got going on here is

140
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,918
kind of peculiar

141
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,359
it's kind of um

142
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:25,279
special in in in in terms of complexity

143
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,160
and maybe you can even begin

144
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:29,599
to measure it and like come up with

145
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,680
metrics where

146
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,360
whatever we got going on on earth these

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,519
like uh

148
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,879
interesting hierarchical complexities

149
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,719
that form

150
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,800
more and more sophisticated biological

151
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,759
system that seems kind of unique when

152
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,360
you look at the entire universe

153
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,439
the um

154
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,280
the observable part that we can see with

155
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,519
our tools i mean

156
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,198
so i have to ask as you described in

157
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:55,599
your book once again

158
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,520
uh schroedinger wrote the book what is

159
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,120
life based on the few lectures he gave

160
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,719
in 1944

161
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,639
so let me ask

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,840
the fundamental question here

163
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,079
what is

164
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,318
life this particular thing we got going

165
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,240
on here this pocket of complexity that

166
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,000
emerged from such simple things yeah

167
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,478
it's a tough question i asked that

168
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,519
question even to richard dawkins

169
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,680
once

170
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,918
and i already have my preconceived

171
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,519
notion which he pretty much confirmed

172
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,918
which is

173
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,079
if one could give an answer to that

174
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:28,000
question that allowed you to sort of

175
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,560
draw a line in the sand

176
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,879
between the not living and the living

177
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,720
then perhaps we would have the insight

178
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,879
that we yearn for and trying to say what

179
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,440
is so special about life but the fact of

180
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:41,759
the matter is it's a continuum there's a

181
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,079
continuum from the things that we would

182
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,759
typically call non-living inanimate to

183
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:49,839
the things that we obviously call

184
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,680
adamant and full of the currents of life

185
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,399
somewhere in there

186
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,240
it is a question of the complexity of

187
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,839
the structure the ability of the

188
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,560
structure to

189
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:02,638
take in raw material from the

190
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,680
environment and process it through a

191
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,960
metabolism that allows the structure to

192
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,120
extract energy and to release entropy to

193
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,359
the wider environment

194
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:16,800
somewhere in those collections of

195
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:19,439
biological processes is the

196
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,199
necessity or the necessary ingredients

197
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,959
and processes for life but

198
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,759
drawing that line in the sand is not

199
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:27,359
something that we're able to do but i

200
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,960
would agree with you

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,879
it's deeply

202
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:33,839
peculiar

203
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:36,399
it may in fact be unique

204
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,598
but it may not it could be that

205
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,079
the universe is such that under fairly

206
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:43,120
typical conditions a star

207
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,800
that's

208
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,360
a well-ordered source of low entropy

209
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,759
energy that's what the sun is together

210
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,400
with a planet being bathed by that low

211
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,560
entropy energy together with a surface

212
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:59,439
that has enough of the

213
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:02,240
raw constituents that we recognize are

214
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:04,399
fairly commonplace result of supernova

215
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,439
explosions where star

216
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,359
spews forth the result of the nuclear

217
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,319
furnace that is the core of a star it

218
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,879
could be

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,879
that all you need are those fairly

220
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:17,199
commonplace conditions

221
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,439
and maybe life naturally forms like the

222
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,000
james webb space telescope right is

223
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,680
going up hopefully in december and one

224
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,079
of the one of the goals of that mission

225
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,800
is to look at atmospheres around distant

226
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:31,680
planets and perhaps come to some sense

227
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:34,320
of how special or not

228
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,839
life or leaf life as we know it is in

229
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,959
the universe

230
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:40,800
which part of the story of life

231
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,879
let's stick to earth for a second do you

232
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,479
think is the uh is the hardest if you

233
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,720
were like uh

234
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,720
a betting man like which part is the

235
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,040
hardest to uh make happen is it the

236
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,320
origin of life again we haven't drawn

237
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:54,958
the line of worth

238
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,480
as you say uh the line between a rock

239
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:57,838
and a rabbit

240
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,039
um

241
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,120
that part is it uh complex organisms

242
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,480
like multicellular organisms

243
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,480
is it uh

244
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:09,278
crawling out of the ocean where the fish

245
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,560
somehow figured out how to crawl around

246
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,799
is it then the

247
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:15,359
uh us homo sapiens

248
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,799
as we like to think of ourselves special

249
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,039
and intelligent

250
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,120
uh or is it somewhere in between as you

251
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:25,120
also talk about

252
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:27,278
again very hard to know at which point

253
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,679
this consciousness yeah

254
00:09:27,278 --> 00:09:31,120
emerge like if you if you were to sort

255
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:33,039
of took us

256
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,278
a survey and made bets

257
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,199
about other earth-like planets in the

258
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,120
universe where do you think they get

259
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,879
stuck the most well i would certainly

260
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,879
see if we're going to go all the way to

261
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:45,039
conscious beings like ourselves i would

262
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,240
put it at the onset of consciousness

263
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,240
which again

264
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,799
i think is a continuum i don't think it

265
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,039
is something that you can draw the line

266
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,559
in the sand but there are obvious

267
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,120
circumstances there are obvious

268
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,838
creatures such as ourselves where we do

269
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,759
recognize a certain kind of

270
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:04,399
self-reflective conscious awareness

271
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:07,679
and if we think about what

272
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:10,879
it would require for a system of living

273
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,439
beings to acquire consciousness

274
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,639
i think that's probably the hardest part

275
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,839
because look

276
00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:18,240
take earth

277
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:21,279
and recognize that it weren't for you

278
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:24,000
know some singular event 65 million

279
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:26,480
years ago where this large rock slams

280
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,440
into planet earth and wipes out the

281
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,800
dinosaurs maybe the dinosaurs would

282
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,600
still rule the planet and

283
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:38,879
they may well have not developed the

284
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,600
kind of conscious awareness that we have

285
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,439
so

286
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,879
for billions of years on this planet

287
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,880
there was life

288
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:47,919
that didn't have the kind of conscious

289
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:51,278
awareness that we have and it was an

290
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:55,439
accidental event in astrophysical

291
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:58,159
history that allowed a mammalian species

292
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,240
like us to ultimately be the end product

293
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:01,919
and so yeah i could imagine there's a

294
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,759
lot of life out there

295
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,479
but perhaps none of it's

296
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,559
wondering what's the meaning of life or

297
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,480
trying to make sense of it

298
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,958
just going about its business of

299
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
survival which of course is the dominant

300
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,679
activity that life on this planet has

301
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,439
practice we are a rare exception to that

302
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,120
and i really appreciate that you lean

303
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,360
into some of these unanswerable

304
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,360
questions to me today but the

305
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,278
so you think about consciousness

306
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,759
not as like a phase shift the binary

307
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:33,278
zero one you think uh

308
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:35,519
it was a continuum that humans somehow

309
00:11:33,278 --> 00:11:37,360
are maybe some of the most conscious

310
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,959
beings on earth

311
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,839
so you're so

312
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:43,039
i mean people will dispute that

313
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,279
yes i mean whoa and it's a very hard

314
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:47,120
argument people will dispute that rocks

315
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:49,759
probably will stay quiet on the matter

316
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,480
maybe not right for the moment they're

317
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:57,200
waiting for their opportunity but but

318
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,519
but i i i agree that um look even when

319
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,519
you and i look at each other i

320
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,440
am not fully convinced

321
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,278
that you're a conscious being right i

322
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,440
mean i think that you are on to me i

323
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:09,200
mean your behavior is such that that's

324
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,360
the best explanation for what's going on

325
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,839
but of course we're all in the position

326
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,839
of only having direct awareness of our

327
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,160
own conscious

328
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,160
being and therefore when it comes to

329
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:21,919
other creatures in the world we're in a

330
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:24,399
similar state of ignorance regarding

331
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:27,278
what's actually happening inside of

332
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,720
their head if they have a head and so

333
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,439
it's hard to know

334
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:33,360
how singular we are but i would say

335
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,200
based on the best available data and the

336
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,800
best explanations we can make yeah there

337
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,360
is something special about us i don't

338
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:40,559
think that there are fish walking around

339
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,278
and you know

340
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:45,599
coming up with you know existentialism i

341
00:12:43,278 --> 00:12:47,679
don't know that there are you know dogs

342
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,879
walking around who've developed an

343
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,799
understanding the general theory of

344
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,919
relativity i mean maybe we're wrong but

345
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:55,599
that seems the best explanation

346
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,679
what do you think is more special

347
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,920
intelligence or consciousness

348
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,039
i think consciousness and i think that

349
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:03,519
there's a

350
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,838
deep connection between these ideas they

351
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,720
are distinct but they're deeply

352
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,200
connected but

353
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,959
look i mean to me and to of course many

354
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,720
philosophers actually coined a name for

355
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,278
this the heart problem of consciousness

356
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,920
you know david chalmers and others

357
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,879
as a physicist i look at the world and i

358
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,799
see

359
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,919
it's particles governed by physical law

360
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,519
we can name

361
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,159
them you know we've got

362
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,320
electrons we've got quarks that come in

363
00:13:28,159 --> 00:13:32,078
various flavors and so forth we have a

364
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,278
list of ingredients that science has

365
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,359
revealed

366
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,679
and we have a list of laws that

367
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,159
seemingly govern those ingredients and

368
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:41,120
and nowhere in there is there even a

369
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,559
hint

370
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,240
that when you put

371
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:45,518
those particles together in the right

372
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,320
way

373
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,720
an inner world should turn on and it's

374
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,600
not only that there's no hint

375
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,959
it's insane i mean it's ridiculous

376
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
how could it be

377
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:58,958
that a thoughtless

378
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:00,078
passionless emotionless

379
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:03,119
particle

380
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:06,559
when grouped together with compatriots

381
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,480
somehow can yield something so deeply

382
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:12,719
foreign to the nature of the ingredients

383
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,120
themselves so so answering that question

384
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,759
i think is among the deepest and most

385
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,639
difficult questions that we face

386
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,519
do you

387
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,320
think

388
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,360
it is in fact a really hard

389
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,560
problem

390
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
or

391
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:28,078
is it possible

392
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,919
i think you mentioned your book that

393
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:32,000
it's just like almost like a side effect

394
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,838
it's an emergent thing that's like oh

395
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,879
it's nice it's like a nice little

396
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,800
feature

397
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,198
yeah well i mean when people use the

398
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,159
phrase hard problem i mean they mean in

399
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:44,719
a somewhat technical sense that

400
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:45,679
it's trying to explain something

401
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,800
that

402
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,958
seems fundamentally unavailable to third

403
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,319
party objective

404
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:54,239
analysis

405
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,720
right i'm the only one that can get

406
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,480
inside my head and i can tell you a lot

407
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,839
about what's happening inside my head

408
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,000
right now it's reflected in what i'm

409
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,600
saying and you can try to deduce things

410
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,198
about what's going on inside my head but

411
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,040
you don't have access to it in the way

412
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,039
that i do and so it seems like a

413
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:12,078
fundamentally different kind of problem

414
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,599
from the ones that we have successfully

415
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:15,278
dealt with over the course of centuries

416
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,040
in science where we look at the motion

417
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,360
of the moon everybody can look everybody

418
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:21,838
can measure it we look at you know the

419
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,399
properties of hydrogen when you shine

420
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,880
lasers on everybody can look at the data

421
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,039
and understand it and so it seems like a

422
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,240
fundamentally different problem and in

423
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:34,399
that sense it seems like it is hard

424
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,079
relative to the others but

425
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,958
i do think ultimately that the

426
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:41,120
explanation will be as you recount i

427
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,479
think that a hundred years from now or

428
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,560
maybe it's a thousand it's hard to

429
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,800
predict the time scale for

430
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,638
developments but i think we'll get to a

431
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,838
place where we'll look back and kind of

432
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,639
smile

433
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,279
at

434
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,519
those folks in the 20th century and

435
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,838
before 21st century and before who

436
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:01,278
thought consciousness was so incredibly

437
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:04,000
mysterious when the reality of it is

438
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:06,879
it's just a thing that happens when

439
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,240
particles come together and and however

440
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:11,679
mysterious that feels right now

441
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,759
i think for instance when we start to

442
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,359
build conscious systems you know things

443
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,519
that you know you're more familiar with

444
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,000
than i am when we start to build these

445
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,759
artificial systems and those systems

446
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,120
report to us

447
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,879
i'm feeling sad

448
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,679
i'm feeling anxious yeah there's a world

449
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,679
going on inside here i think the mystery

450
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,599
of consciousness will just begin to

451
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,919
evaporate well that's

452
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,839
first of all beautifully put and i agree

453
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:38,319
with you completely just the way you

454
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:42,079
said it it'll begin to evaporate

455
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:45,278
i have built quite a few robots and have

456
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:48,000
had them do emotion

457
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:49,439
emotional type things and it's immediate

458
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,278
that exactly what you're saying this

459
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,360
kind of mystery of consciousness starts

460
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,639
to evaporate that

461
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,680
the

462
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,278
kind of need to truly understand to

463
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,198
solve the hard problem of consciousness

464
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:02,000
like disappears because

465
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:03,758
well

466
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,838
i don't really care

467
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,000
if i understand what can solve the hard

468
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:09,759
problem of consciousness that thing sure

469
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,720
as heck looks conscious you know i feel

470
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,640
like that way when i interact with a dog

471
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,880
i don't need to

472
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,120
solve the problem of consciousness to to

473
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,120
be able to interact

474
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,438
and richly

475
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,359
enjoy the experience with this other

476
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:27,199
living being obviously same thing with

477
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,839
other humans i don't need to fully

478
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,038
understand it and there's some aspect

479
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:33,038
maybe this is a little bit too

480
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,319
engineering focused but there's some

481
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,480
aspect in which it feels like

482
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:38,639
consciousness is just a

483
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:41,599
nice trick

484
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,720
to help us communicate with each other

485
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,719
it sounds ridiculous to say but

486
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,919
sort of uh

487
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,880
the ability to experience the world is

488
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,360
very useful in a subjective sense it's

489
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,520
very useful to put yourself in that

490
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:59,599
world and to be able to describe the

491
00:17:57,519 --> 00:18:02,400
experience to others yeah it could be

492
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,079
just the social and the emerge obviously

493
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,240
animals the sort of more primitive

494
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,720
animals might experience consciousness

495
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,120
in some more primitive way

496
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,480
but this kind of rich

497
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,399
subjective experience that we think

498
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,679
about as humans i think it's probably

499
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:20,559
deeply coupled like language and poetry

500
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,679
yeah that resonates with my view as well

501
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,519
i mean there's a

502
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,400
scientist maybe you've spoken to michael

503
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:29,200
graziano from princeton yeah he um

504
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,038
he's developed ideas of consciousness

505
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,120
that look i don't think they solve the

506
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,079
problem but i think they do illuminate

507
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,359
it in an interesting way where basically

508
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:38,879
we

509
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:42,079
are not aware

510
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,039
of all the underlying physiochemical

511
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:47,918
processes that make our brains and our

512
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,960
inner worlds tick the way they do

513
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:54,240
and because of that dissociation between

514
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,720
sensation and the physics of it and the

515
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,200
chemistry of it and the biology of it it

516
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,839
feels like our minds and our inner

517
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:05,120
worlds are just untethered like floating

518
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:06,399
somewhere in this gray matter inside of

519
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:08,319
our heads

520
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:11,840
and the way i like to think of it is

521
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:14,798
like look you know if um if if if you're

522
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:17,439
in a dark room right and and i had

523
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:19,359
glow-in-the-dark paint on my fingers so

524
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,000
all you saw was my fingers dancing

525
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,079
around there'd be something mysterious

526
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,119
how how could those fingers be doing

527
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,439
that and then you turn a light you

528
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:28,798
realize oh there's this arm underlying

529
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,038
it and that's the deep physical

530
00:19:28,798 --> 00:19:33,279
connection explains it all and i think

531
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:35,279
that's what we're missing the deep

532
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,359
physical connection between what's

533
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,519
happening up here and what is

534
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:42,000
responsible for it in a physical

535
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,038
chemical biological way and so to me

536
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,279
that at least gives me some

537
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:48,720
understanding of why consciousness feels

538
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:50,639
so mysterious because we are suppressing

539
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,120
all of the underlying

540
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,200
science that ultimately is responsible

541
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,678
for it and one day we will reveal that

542
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,759
more fully and i think that will help us

543
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,440
tether this experience to something

544
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:05,359
quite tangible in the world i wonder

545
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,798
if the mystery

546
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:08,798
is uh

547
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,079
an important component of enjoying

548
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,639
something

549
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,158
so once once we know how this thing

550
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,000
works

551
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,840
maybe we uh

552
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,919
will no longer enjoy

553
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,399
like this conversation we'll seek other

554
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,240
sources of enjoyment but

555
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,000
there's uh this is again from an

556
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,200
engineering perspective i wonder if the

557
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,679
mystery

558
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:31,679
is is an important component well you

559
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,480
know there's have you ever seen

560
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,559
there's this beautiful interview that

561
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,960
richard feynman did

562
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,079
you know great nobel laureate physicist

563
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,919
responsible for a lot of our

564
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:44,000
understanding of quantum mechanics

565
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,440
quantum fields and so forth and he

566
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,599
was in a conversation with an

567
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,480
interviewer where he noted that some

568
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:54,558
people feel like once the mystery is

569
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,679
gone once science explains something

570
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,599
it

571
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,759
the beauty goes away you know the wonder

572
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,000
if it goes away and he was

573
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,400
emphasizing in his response to that he's

574
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,679
like no that's not the right way of

575
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,440
thinking about he says look when i look

576
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,280
at a rose

577
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,720
he says yeah i can still

578
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:15,038
deeply enjoy the aroma the color the

579
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,880
texture he says but what i can do that

580
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,119
you can't if you're not a physicist i

581
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
can look more deeply and understand

582
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:22,399
where the red comes from where the aroma

583
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,120
comes from where the structure comes

584
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,480
from he says that only

585
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:29,759
augments

586
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,240
my wonder it only augments my experience

587
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:34,319
it doesn't flatten it or take away from

588
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,919
it so

589
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,038
yeah well i sort of take that as a bit

590
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,159
of a

591
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:43,200
of a motto in some sense that that there

592
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,559
is a wonder that comes from a kind of

593
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,480
ignorance and i don't mean that in a

594
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,558
derogatory sense but just from not

595
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,640
knowing so there is a wonder that comes

596
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,359
from mystery there's another kind of

597
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:56,640
wonder that comes from knowing

598
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:59,359
and and and deep knowing and i think

599
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,840
that kind of wonder has its own

600
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:04,558
special character that in some ways can

601
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:07,038
be more gratifying

602
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:09,519
i hope he's right i hope you're right

603
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:11,679
and but there's also i remember he

604
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,440
he said something about like an

605
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,360
like science is an onion or something

606
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,960
like that you can peel back you can keep

607
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,158
it keep peeling back i mean there is

608
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,679
also

609
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,919
when you understand something there's

610
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,200
always a sense that there's more mystery

611
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,000
to understand

612
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:28,080
like you never get to the bottom of the

613
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,599
mystery but i think it's also different

614
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:32,240
than you know

615
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:34,558
i don't think you can analogize say to a

616
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,000
magician right the magician you know

617
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,839
does some trick you learn how it sounds

618
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,119
like oh my god that was that's

619
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:43,038
ridiculous when you find but but nature

620
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,918
is perhaps the best magician if you want

621
00:22:43,038 --> 00:22:47,599
to try to make the analogy there because

622
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,880
when you peel things back and you

623
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:51,279
understand

624
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:53,120
how it is that things have color and you

625
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,319
have electrons

626
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:58,558
dancing from one orbital to another

627
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,720
emitting photons at very particular

628
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:02,319
wavelengths that are described by these

629
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,000
beautiful equations of quantum

630
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:06,000
electrodynamics part of which that

631
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,400
feynman developed

632
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,759
it gives you a greater sense

633
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,159
of awe when the curtain is pulled back

634
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,400
than what happens in other circumstances

635
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,400
where it does flatten it completely yeah

636
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,280
it's very possible then say in physics

637
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,600
that we arrive at a theory of everything

638
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,119
that unifies the laws of physics and has

639
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,439
a very strong understanding of the

640
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,239
fabric of reality even like from the

641
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:32,000
very for the big bang to today

642
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,880
it's possible that

643
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,880
that understanding is only going to

644
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,400
elevate our appreciation of this whole

645
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,799
thing yeah i think it will i think it

646
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,480
will i think it has it has so far

647
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,158
but the other side of it which you which

648
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:47,599
you emphasize is

649
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,080
it's not like science somehow

650
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,319
reaches an end right there are certain

651
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,639
categories of questions that do reach an

652
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:56,798
end i think we one day we'll close the

653
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,278
book on nature's ingredients and the

654
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,359
fundamental laws now that can't prove

655
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:03,038
that maybe it goes on forever smaller

656
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,798
and smaller maybe they're deeper and

657
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:06,319
deeper laws but i i don't think so i

658
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:07,679
think that there's going to be a

659
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:10,000
collection of ingredients in a

660
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,200
collection of basic laws that chapter

661
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,319
will close

662
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,558
but

663
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:17,038
it's one chapter now we take that

664
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,879
knowledge and we try to understand how

665
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,759
the world builds the structures that it

666
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,200
does you know from planets to people to

667
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:25,519
black holes

668
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,600
to the possibility of other universes

669
00:24:25,519 --> 00:24:29,759
and every step of the way

670
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:32,158
the collection of questions that we

671
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:33,278
don't know the answer to only blossoms

672
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,360
and so

673
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:36,880
there's a there's a deep

674
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,319
sense of gratification from

675
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,120
understanding certain quantities of the

676
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,399
world but i would say that if you take a

677
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:45,278
ratio

678
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,519
of what we understand to the things that

679
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,440
we know that we don't yet understand

680
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:50,960
that ratio keeps getting smaller and

681
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,558
smaller because the things that we know

682
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,480
that we don't understand grows larger

683
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:56,558
and larger

684
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,558
do you have a hope that we solve that

685
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:00,798
theory of everything puzzle

686
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:03,678
in the next few decades so there's been

687
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:05,918
a bunch of attempts from string theory

688
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,000
to all kinds of attempts of trying to

689
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,159
solve quantum gravity or basically come

690
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,278
up with a theory for quantum gravity

691
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:16,080
there's a lot of uh complexities to this

692
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,919
one for experimental validation

693
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:20,240
you have to observe effects that are

694
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,840
very difficult to uh measure

695
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,519
so you have to build like that's like an

696
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:25,119
engineering challenge

697
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:26,798
and then there's the theory challenge

698
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,038
which is like

699
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,839
it seems very difficult to connect the

700
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:33,919
laws of gravity to quantum mechanics do

701
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,798
you have a hope or are we

702
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,880
hopelessly stuck well i have to have to

703
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,798
have a hope i mean it's

704
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,760
in some sense but i devote at least part

705
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,079
of my

706
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,919
professional life toward trying to make

707
00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:47,359
progress on i'm glad you use the phrase

708
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,120
quantum gravity

709
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:51,359
i'm not a great fan of the theory of

710
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,199
everything phrase because

711
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,719
it does make other scientists feel like

712
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,558
if they're not working on this what are

713
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,519
they working on man's like you know

714
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:58,720
there's not much left when you're

715
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,558
talking about theory of everything

716
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,360
biology is just small d yeah right

717
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,599
exactly

718
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,079
yeah so so it is really trying to put

719
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:08,879
gravity and quantum mechanics together

720
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:12,960
and uh since i was a college kid i was

721
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:16,000
uh deeply fascinated with gravity

722
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,880
and as i learned quantum mechanics the

723
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,640
the notion of physicists being stumped

724
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,440
and trying to blend them together how

725
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,840
could one not get fired up about maybe

726
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,600
contributing something to that journey

727
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:29,359
and so we've been on this you know i've

728
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,678
been on this for 30 years since i was a

729
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:33,519
student we we have made progress

730
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,640
we do have ideas you mentioned strength

731
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:40,158
theory is one possible scenario it's not

732
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,320
stuck string theory is a vibrant field

733
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,600
of research that is making incredible

734
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:45,038
progress

735
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:47,359
but we've not

736
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:49,359
made progress on this issue of

737
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,798
experimental verification validation

738
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:55,119
which as you know it is a vital part of

739
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:57,759
the story so i would have hoped that by

740
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:58,959
now we would have made contact with

741
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,839
observation if you would have

742
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,798
interviewed me back in the 80s when i

743
00:27:01,839 --> 00:27:06,720
was you know a wild bright-eyed kid

744
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,000
trying to make headway working 18 hours

745
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
a day on this sort of stuff i would have

746
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,240
said yeah by by 2021 yeah we're gonna

747
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,159
know whether it's right or wrong we'll

748
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,440
make contact i would have said look

749
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,120
there may be certain mathematical

750
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,880
puzzles that we've got to work out but

751
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:21,439
we'll know enough to make contact with

752
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,960
experiment that has not happened

753
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,200
on the other hand if you would have

754
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,840
interviewed me back then and asked me

755
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,200
will we be able to talk about

756
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:34,079
detailed qualities of black holes and

757
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,120
understand them at the uh the level of

758
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:38,720
detail that we actually i i would have

759
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,879
said no i i don't think that we're going

760
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,720
to be able to do that will we have a

761
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,399
an exact formulation of strength here in

762
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,480
certain circumstances no i don't think

763
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,000
we're going to have that and yet we do

764
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,759
so it's just to say you don't know where

765
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,919
the progress is going to happen but yes

766
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,919
i do hold out hope that

767
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,600
maybe before i move on

768
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,640
to wherever i don't think there is an

769
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:04,079
after but i i would love before i

770
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,880
leave this earth to to know the answer

771
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,038
but

772
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,240
you know science and the universe it's

773
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,519
not about

774
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,679
pleasing any individual it is what it is

775
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:16,079
and so we just press onward and we'll

776
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,960
see where it goes so in terms of string

777
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:18,720
theory

778
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,120
if i just look from an outsider's

779
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:23,278
perspective currently at the theoretical

780
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,918
physics community string theory is the

781
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:28,960
theory was as a theory has been very

782
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:30,880
popular for for a few decades but has

783
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,159
recently fallen out of favor or at least

784
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,480
there's been like

785
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,200
you know it became more popular to kind

786
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,720
of

787
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,278
ask the question

788
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,360
is string theory really the answer

789
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,519
where do you fall on this like how do

790
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,678
you make sense of this puzzle why do you

791
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,440
think it has fallen out of favor yeah so

792
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,080
i don't i would actually challenge the

793
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,840
statement that's fallen out of favor

794
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,038
i would say that

795
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:55,519
any

796
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:59,038
field of research when it's new and it's

797
00:28:55,519 --> 00:29:01,200
the the bright shiny bicycle that no one

798
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,879
has yet seen on that block yeah it's

799
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,919
going to attract attention

800
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,000
and

801
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,320
the news outlets are going to cover it

802
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:12,240
and students are going to flock to it

803
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:14,960
sure but as a as a field matures it does

804
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,519
shed those qualities because it's no

805
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:20,240
longer as novel as it was when it was

806
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,000
first introduced 30 or 40 years ago

807
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,240
but you need to judge it by a different

808
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,519
standard you need to judge it by

809
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,278
is it making progress on foundational

810
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,000
issues deepening our understanding of

811
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,960
the subject and by that measure string

812
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,480
theory

813
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,798
is is is scoring very high

814
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,319
now at the same time you also need to

815
00:29:38,798 --> 00:29:42,720
judge whether it makes contact with

816
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:45,038
experiment as we discussed before too

817
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,720
and on that measure we're still

818
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,079
challenged so

819
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,960
i would say that

820
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:55,119
many strengthers myself included

821
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,278
are are very sober about the theory it

822
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,599
it has the tremendous progress that it

823
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,079
had 30 40 years ago that hasn't gone

824
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:05,278
away but we've become

825
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:07,839
better equipped at assessing

826
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:09,679
the long journey ahead and that was

827
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:11,918
something that we weren't particularly

828
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,559
good at back say in the 80s look when i

829
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,320
was just starting out in the field

830
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,720
there was a sense of

831
00:30:16,319 --> 00:30:21,839
physics is about to end

832
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:24,640
string theory is about to be the be-all

833
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:27,599
and end-all final unified theory and

834
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,360
that will bring this chapter to a close

835
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:31,199
now i have to say i think it was more

836
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,199
the younger physicists who were saying

837
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,600
that some of the more seasoned even if

838
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,038
they were pro-string theory at the time

839
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:39,759
i don't know if they were rolling their

840
00:30:37,038 --> 00:30:42,240
eyes but they knew yeah that was going

841
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:44,079
to be a long long journey i think people

842
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,679
like you know john schwartz one of the

843
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,079
founders of string theory michael green

844
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:50,559
no relation to me founders of the theory

845
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,798
edward whitton you know one of the main

846
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,759
people driving the theory back then and

847
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,119
today

848
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,798
i think they knew that we were in for a

849
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,759
long haul

850
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:04,240
and and that's the nature of science

851
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,079
quick hits that resolve everything few

852
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,480
and far between

853
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,359
and so if you were in

854
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,240
for

855
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,119
the

856
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,440
quick

857
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,319
solution to the big questions of the

858
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,679
world then you would have been

859
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,119
disappointed and i think there were

860
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,320
people who were disappointed and moved

861
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:23,199
on and work on other subjects if we were

862
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:25,918
in in the way that einstein was in

863
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,120
for a lifetime of investigation to try

864
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,000
to see

865
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:29,599
where

866
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,079
what the answers to the deep questions

867
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:35,759
would be then i think string theory has

868
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:36,639
been a rich source of material that has

869
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,440
kept

870
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,679
so many people deeply engaged in moving

871
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,000
the frontier forward there's a few

872
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:44,960
qualities about string theory which are

873
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,759
weird

874
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,079
i mean a lot of physics is just weird

875
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,240
and beautiful so let me ask the question

876
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:55,278
what do you as most beautiful about

877
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,839
string theory well but what attracted me

878
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,000
to the theory at the outset

879
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:02,319
beyond its putting gravity and quantum

880
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,558
mechanics together which i think is um

881
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:06,558
it's true claim to fame at least on

882
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:08,079
paper it's able to do that

883
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,759
what attracted me to here was the fact

884
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:11,038
that it requires extra dimensions of

885
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,278
space

886
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:18,319
and this was an idea that intrigued me

887
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:20,480
in a very deep way even before i really

888
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,918
understood what it meant

889
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,000
i somehow

890
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,759
had i mean talk about sort of the

891
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,720
emotional part of consciousness and the

892
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:31,839
cognitive part in some perhaps you call

893
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,480
it strange in some strange emotional way

894
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:37,439
i was enamored with einstein's general

895
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,360
relativity the idea of curved space and

896
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,600
time before i really knew what it meant

897
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,119
it just spoke to me i don't know how

898
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,398
else to say it

899
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,359
and then

900
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:49,119
when i subsequently learned that people

901
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,199
had thought about more dimensions of

902
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:53,038
space than we can see and how those

903
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,120
extra dimensions would

904
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:57,038
be vital to a deep understanding of the

905
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:59,839
things that we do see in this world four

906
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:01,599
five six dimensions might explain why

907
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,119
there are certain forces and particles

908
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,678
and how they behave

909
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:08,239
to me this was like amazing utterly

910
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:10,559
amazing and then when i learned that

911
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,839
strength theory embraced all these ideas

912
00:33:10,558 --> 00:33:13,519
embraced the general theory of

913
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:15,199
relativity embraced quantum mechanics

914
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,120
embraced the possibility of extra

915
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,519
dimensions

916
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:21,359
then i was then i was hooked and so when

917
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,759
i was a graduate student

918
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:25,278
we would just spend hours

919
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:27,599
we i mean a couple of other graduate

920
00:33:25,278 --> 00:33:29,839
students and myself who had a have sort

921
00:33:27,599 --> 00:33:32,240
of worked really well together at oxford

922
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:33,918
in england we would we would work these

923
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,679
enormous numbers of hours a day trying

924
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,080
to understand the shapes of these extra

925
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,159
dimensions the geometry of them what

926
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:41,759
those geometrical shapes for the extra

927
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,600
dimensions would imply for things that

928
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:46,558
we see in the world around us

929
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:49,278
and it was a it was a heady heady time

930
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:51,440
and and that kind of excitement has sort

931
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:52,398
of filtered through over the decades but

932
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,919
i'd say

933
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:55,359
that's really

934
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,759
the the

935
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:00,079
part of the theory that i think really

936
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:01,759
hooked me most wrongly

937
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,278
how are we supposed to think about those

938
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:06,720
extra dimensions i was supposed to

939
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:08,480
imagine actual physical reality or

940
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,079
is this more in the space of mathematics

941
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,960
that allows you to

942
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,200
sort of come up with tricks to describe

943
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,280
the four-dimensional reality that we

944
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,598
more directly perceive

945
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,079
no one really knows the answer of course

946
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,240
but if i take the most straightforward

947
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:26,800
approach to string theory you really are

948
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:29,358
imagining that these dimensions

949
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,399
are there they're real i mean just as

950
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,480
you would

951
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:34,480
say that the three space dimensions

952
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:35,519
around us you know left right back forth

953
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,079
up down

954
00:34:35,519 --> 00:34:40,239
yeah we they're real they're here we are

955
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,560
immersed within those dimensions

956
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,279
these other dimensions are

957
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:47,599
as real as these with the one difference

958
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,839
being their shape and their size

959
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,240
differs from the shape and size of the

960
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:54,559
dimensions that we have direct access to

961
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,358
through through human experience

962
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,199
and

963
00:34:55,358 --> 00:35:00,159
one approach imagines that these extra

964
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:03,279
dimensions are tightly coiled up

965
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:06,480
curled up crushed together if you will

966
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,720
into a beautiful geometrical form

967
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,280
that's all around us

968
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:13,439
but just too small for us to detect with

969
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:15,040
our eyes too small for us to detect even

970
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,679
with the most powerful equipment that we

971
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:20,000
have nevertheless according to the

972
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:22,879
mathematics the size and the shape of

973
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,880
those extra dimensions leaves an imprint

974
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,519
in the world that we do have access to

975
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,920
so one of the ways that we have hoped

976
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,320
yet to achieve to make contact with

977
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,559
experimental physics is to see a

978
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,559
signature of those extra dimensions in

979
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:38,159
places like the large hadron collider in

980
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,000
geneva switzerland

981
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:41,440
and it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean

982
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,358
it won't happen

983
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,358
but that would be

984
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,559
a stunning moment in the history of the

985
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:50,078
species if data that we acquired in

986
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:52,159
these dimensions

987
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,280
gives us kind of incontrovertible

988
00:35:52,159 --> 00:35:55,199
evidence

989
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,839
that these dimensions are not the only

990
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,439
dimensions i mean how

991
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:01,199
mind-blowing would would that be so with

992
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,240
a large header and collider it would be

993
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:03,919
something in the movement of the

994
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:06,559
particles or

995
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,039
also the gravitational waves potentially

996
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,559
be a place where you can detect signs of

997
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,559
multiple dimensions like with something

998
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:14,880
called ligo but much more accurate in

999
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:17,440
principle all of these can work so one

1000
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:19,760
of the experiments that we had high

1001
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,240
hopes for but by high hopes i'm actually

1002
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,200
exaggerating one of the experiments that

1003
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:25,519
we

1004
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,519
imagined might in the best of all

1005
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:29,440
circumstances yield some insight we

1006
00:36:27,519 --> 00:36:31,440
weren't with baited breath waiting for

1007
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,838
the result we knew it was a long shot

1008
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,000
when you slam protons together at very

1009
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:37,599
high speed as a large hadron collider if

1010
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,880
there are these extra dimensions and if

1011
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,838
they have the right

1012
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,400
form and that's a hypothesis that may

1013
00:36:41,838 --> 00:36:46,960
not be correct but when the proteins

1014
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,920
collide they can create debris energetic

1015
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,480
debris that can in some sense leave our

1016
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,400
dimensions and insert itself into the

1017
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,159
other dimensions and the way you'd

1018
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,000
recognize that is

1019
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,759
there'd be more energy before the

1020
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,519
collision than after the collision

1021
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,160
because the debris would have taken

1022
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:07,199
energy away from the place where our

1023
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:09,679
detectors can detect it so that's that's

1024
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:12,000
one real concrete way that you could

1025
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:15,838
find evidence for extra dimensions but

1026
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,400
yeah since extra dimensions are of space

1027
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,119
and gravity is something that

1028
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,639
exists within in fact is associated with

1029
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,838
the shape of space

1030
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:29,598
gravitational waves in principle can

1031
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:31,599
provide a kind of you know cat scan of

1032
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:33,838
of the extra dimensions if you had

1033
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,720
sufficient control over

1034
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:38,400
those processes we don't yet but perhaps

1035
00:37:36,719 --> 00:37:40,159
one day we will

1036
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,320
does it make you sad

1037
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,399
a little bit or maybe looking out into

1038
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,440
the future you mentioned edwin

1039
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,119
that no nobel prizes have been given yet

1040
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:51,599
related to string theory do you think

1041
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,838
they will be do you think you have to

1042
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:55,760
have experimental validation or can a

1043
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:58,559
nobel prize be given which i don't think

1044
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,839
has been given for quite a long time

1045
00:37:58,559 --> 00:38:01,838
for uh

1046
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:04,239
purely sort of theoretical contributions

1047
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:06,880
yeah it certainly as a matter of

1048
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:09,039
historical precedent has been the case

1049
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,000
that those who win the prize

1050
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:12,719
have

1051
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,199
established investigated

1052
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:18,559
illuminated a demonstrably real quality

1053
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:19,919
of the world

1054
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,159
so

1055
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:24,800
gravitational waves the prize was

1056
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:27,199
awarded after they were detected not not

1057
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,440
the mathematics of it but the actual

1058
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,559
detection of it you know the higgs

1059
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,320
particle

1060
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:36,159
you know it was an idea that came from

1061
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,240
the 1960s peter higgs and others in fact

1062
00:38:36,159 --> 00:38:39,598
and it wasn't until

1063
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:42,479
2012

1064
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,160
on july 4th when the announcement came

1065
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:47,119
that this protocol had been detected the

1066
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:49,199
large hadron collider that people viewed

1067
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,720
it as eligible for the nobel prize the

1068
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:51,919
idea was there the math was there but

1069
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:54,480
you needed to

1070
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,800
confirm it indeed the prize ultimately

1071
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,920
was awarded so i'm not surprised

1072
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,320
in fact i would have been surprised if a

1073
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,039
nobel prize had been awarded in the

1074
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,920
arena of string theory because it's far

1075
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:08,000
too

1076
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:10,240
speculative right now it's far too

1077
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,119
hypothetical in fact

1078
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,479
i am sympathetic to the view

1079
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,440
that it really shouldn't be called

1080
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,559
string theory it degrades the word

1081
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,800
theory

1082
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:23,759
because theory in science of course

1083
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,760
means the best available explanation for

1084
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,000
the things that we observe in the world

1085
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,720
the things that we measure in

1086
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,519
experiments about the world

1087
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,439
and string theory does not do that at

1088
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:38,000
least not yet so it really should be

1089
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,400
the string hypothesis right we're at an

1090
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,559
earlier stage of development

1091
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,440
and that's not the kind of thing that

1092
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:47,358
nobel prizes should be awarded for

1093
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:50,159
what do you think about the critics out

1094
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:53,358
there peter white he's from colombia too

1095
00:39:50,159 --> 00:39:55,440
i think sabine hafenstadter

1096
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:57,920
is that a healthy thing or should we

1097
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,320
sort of focus on sort of the optimism of

1098
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,079
of these hypotheses yeah

1099
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,960
it's actually a good way that you frame

1100
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,400
it

1101
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,800
because

1102
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,119
i'm always

1103
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,800
somewhat repelled

1104
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,640
by

1105
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,880
views of the world

1106
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:18,318
that start from the negative

1107
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:21,280
try to cut down an idea try to say

1108
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:23,199
that's the wrong way of thinking about

1109
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,040
things and so on i'm

1110
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:26,879
much more drawn maybe because i'm an

1111
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:29,679
optimist i don't know i'm much more

1112
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,480
drawn to those who go out into the world

1113
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:36,318
with new ideas yeah and and don't try to

1114
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,719
cut down one idea but rather present

1115
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:41,039
another one that might be better

1116
00:40:38,719 --> 00:40:43,679
and so you make the first idea maybe

1117
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,119
strengthy irrelevant because you've come

1118
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:47,519
up with the

1119
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:49,920
better approach to the world

1120
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,280
so do i think it's healthy look i think

1121
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,559
having a wide

1122
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,720
range of

1123
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,400
views and perspectives is generally a

1124
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:58,318
healthy thing

1125
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,358
i think it's good to have

1126
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:04,000
arguments within a subject in order that

1127
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:05,119
you stay fresh and you stay focused on

1128
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,838
the things

1129
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:09,599
that matter but in the end of the day i

1130
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:12,719
think it's a more

1131
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:14,559
vital contribution to give us something

1132
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,639
new rather than to criticize something

1133
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,239
that's there yeah i'm totally with you

1134
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:22,559
um but it could be just the nature of

1135
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:25,358
being an optimist i and also just a

1136
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:28,078
a love of engineering it's there's it it

1137
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:30,000
helps nobody by criticizing

1138
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:31,920
the uh the rocket that somebody else

1139
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,199
built just build a

1140
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:38,000
bigger cheaper better rocket

1141
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:39,439
exactly yeah and that seems to be how uh

1142
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,440
human civilization can progress

1143
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,000
effectively

1144
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,679
we we've uh mentioned the second law of

1145
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,719
thermodynamics i got to ask you about

1146
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:48,639
time

1147
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,199
yeah and

1148
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:53,920
do you do you think of time as emergent

1149
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:55,919
or fundamental to our universe i like to

1150
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,039
think of it as emergent

1151
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:00,800
i don't

1152
00:41:57,039 --> 00:42:02,800
have a solid reason for that perspective

1153
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,240
i have a lot of hints of reasons that

1154
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,880
some of which come out of string theory

1155
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:09,118
and quantum gravity that perhaps would

1156
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:11,920
be worth talking about

1157
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,838
but what i would say is

1158
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,880
time is

1159
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:18,799
the most familiar quality of experience

1160
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,880
because there's nothing that takes place

1161
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,359
that doesn't take place within an

1162
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,480
interval of time and yet at the same

1163
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,039
time

1164
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,920
it is perhaps the most mysterious

1165
00:42:27,039 --> 00:42:32,159
quality of the world so it's a wonderful

1166
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,639
confluence of the familiar and the

1167
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,838
deeply mysterious all in one little

1168
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,400
package

1169
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:39,838
if you were to ask me what is time

1170
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,559
i don't i don't really know i don't

1171
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:45,119
think anybody does i i can say

1172
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,199
what time gives us

1173
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,559
it allows us the language for talking

1174
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:51,439
about change

1175
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:54,400
it allows us to envision the events of

1176
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:57,119
the universe being spread out in this

1177
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:59,358
temporal timeline and in that way

1178
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,280
allows us to see the patterns that

1179
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:05,119
unfold within time i mean time allows us

1180
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,079
the structure and the organization to

1181
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,519
think about things in that kind of a

1182
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,200
progression but

1183
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,119
what actually is it

1184
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:14,559
i i don't really know and that's so

1185
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,920
strange because

1186
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,000
we can measure it

1187
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,639
right i mean there are laboratories in

1188
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
the world that measure this thing called

1189
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:26,799
time to spectacular precision

1190
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,400
but you know if you go up to the folks

1191
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:30,400
and say like

1192
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,760
what is it that you're actually

1193
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,358
measuring

1194
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:35,520
i don't know that they can really

1195
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:37,039
articulate the kind of answer that you

1196
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,199
would expect

1197
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,279
from those who are engineering a device

1198
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:43,039
that can measure something called time

1199
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:46,880
to that level of precision

1200
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:49,679
so it's a very curious combination

1201
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,200
what do you make of the one-way

1202
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:56,480
feeling of causality like is causality

1203
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,439
a thing or is that too just a human

1204
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,599
story

1205
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,838
that we put on top of this emerging

1206
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,838
phenomena of time i don't know

1207
00:44:01,838 --> 00:44:05,759
um i can give you my my guess and my

1208
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:09,039
intuition about it

1209
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,400
i do think that at the macroscopic level

1210
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:11,759
if we're talking about sort of the human

1211
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,200
experience of time i do think at the

1212
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,960
macroscopic level there is a fundamental

1213
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:20,559
notion of causality that does emerge

1214
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,480
from a starting point that may not have

1215
00:44:20,559 --> 00:44:24,480
causality built in so i certainly would

1216
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,960
allow that at the deepest

1217
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,800
description of reality when we finally

1218
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:31,838
have that on the table

1219
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,400
we may not see causality directly at

1220
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:36,719
that fundamental level but i do believe

1221
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,599
that we will understand how to go from

1222
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:41,759
that fundamental level to a world where

1223
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:44,318
at the macroscopic level there is this

1224
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:47,520
notion of a causes b

1225
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:49,039
a notion that einstein deeply embraced

1226
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:51,679
in his special theory of relativity

1227
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,199
where he showed that time has qualities

1228
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:56,000
that we wouldn't expect based on

1229
00:44:53,199 --> 00:44:57,919
experience you and i if we move relative

1230
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:59,920
to each other our clocks

1231
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,559
tick off time at different rate and our

1232
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:04,720
clocks is just a means of measuring this

1233
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,639
thing called time so this is really time

1234
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,239
that we're talking about time for you

1235
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,078
and time for me are different if we're

1236
00:45:08,239 --> 00:45:12,318
in relative motion he then shows in the

1237
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:14,880
general theory of relativity that if

1238
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:16,239
we're experiencing different gravity

1239
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,358
different gravitational fields or

1240
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:19,199
actually more precisely different

1241
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:21,279
gravitational potentials

1242
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:24,078
time will elapse for us at different

1243
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,519
rates these are things that are

1244
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,920
astoundingly strange that give rise to a

1245
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:33,358
scientific notion of time travel okay so

1246
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,559
this is this is how far einstein took us

1247
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,639
in

1248
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,199
wiping away the old understanding of

1249
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:41,838
time and injecting a new understanding

1250
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:44,399
of its qualities so so there's so much

1251
00:45:41,838 --> 00:45:46,639
about time that's counterintuitive

1252
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,280
but i do not think that we're ever going

1253
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:51,118
to wipe away causality at the

1254
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,560
macroscopic at the microscope i mean

1255
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,480
there's so many interesting things at

1256
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:57,440
the macroscopic level that may only

1257
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,039
exist at the microscopic level yeah like

1258
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,559
we already talked about consciousness

1259
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,358
that that very well could be one of the

1260
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:04,318
things you mentioned time travel so

1261
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:06,880
um

1262
00:46:04,318 --> 00:46:07,599
i mean according to einstein

1263
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,119
and

1264
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:10,000
in general

1265
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,079
what

1266
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,318
types of travel do you think our

1267
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:15,599
physical universe allows well certainly

1268
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:17,358
allows

1269
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,359
time travel to the future and i'm not

1270
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:21,279
talking about the silly thing that you

1271
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:22,799
and i are now going into the future

1272
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,519
second by second second i'm talking

1273
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,240
about really the diversion that you see

1274
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:30,318
in hollywood at least in terms of its

1275
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:32,159
net effect whereby

1276
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:34,880
an individual

1277
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:36,399
can follow an einsteinian

1278
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:37,358
strategy

1279
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,200
and

1280
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:41,358
propel themselves

1281
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:44,559
into the future in some sense more

1282
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:46,559
quickly so if if i wanted to see what's

1283
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,159
happening on planet earth 1 million

1284
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,838
years from now

1285
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:53,519
einstein tells me how to get 1 million

1286
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:55,358
years from now build a ship i got to

1287
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:58,079
turn to guys you know who know how to

1288
00:46:55,358 --> 00:46:59,838
build stuff i can't do it like you build

1289
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,440
a ship that can go out into the universe

1290
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,119
near the speed of light

1291
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,880
turn around and come back let's say it's

1292
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:07,680
a six month journey out a six month

1293
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,920
journey back and einstein tells me how

1294
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:11,679
fast i need to travel how close to the

1295
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,599
speed of light i need to go so that when

1296
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:16,159
i step out of my ship

1297
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,000
it will now be one million years into

1298
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,000
the future on

1299
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,679
planet earth

1300
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:23,440
and this is not

1301
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,838
a controversial statement right this is

1302
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,240
not something where there's differences

1303
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:31,679
of opinion in the scientific community

1304
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:34,239
any scientist who knows anything about

1305
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:36,239
what einstein taught us agrees with what

1306
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,399
i just said it's it's commonplace it's

1307
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:41,118
bread and butter physics and so that

1308
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:43,680
kind of travel to the future is

1309
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:45,680
absolutely allowed by the laws of

1310
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:47,838
physics there are engineering challenges

1311
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:49,519
they're they're technological challenges

1312
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,920
close to the speed of light yeah yeah

1313
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:53,759
and they're they're even biological

1314
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,200
challenges right they're g-forces that

1315
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:57,440
you're going to experience you know so

1316
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:58,719
there's all sorts of stuff embedded in

1317
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,358
this but those

1318
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:02,799
i will call the details and those

1319
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:04,239
details

1320
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,039
notwithstanding

1321
00:48:04,239 --> 00:48:08,639
the universe allows this kind of travel

1322
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:09,519
to the future and if i could pause real

1323
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:10,719
quick

1324
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,480
you could also

1325
00:48:10,719 --> 00:48:15,279
at the macro level

1326
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,519
with biology extend the human lifespan

1327
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:19,599
to do a kind of

1328
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:22,400
travel forward in time

1329
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,800
if you expand how long we live yeah

1330
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:26,480
that's a way to from a perspective of an

1331
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,760
observer a conscious observer that is a

1332
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,519
human being

1333
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:31,119
you're essentially traveling forward in

1334
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:33,039
time by allowing yourself to live long

1335
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,800
enough to see the thing yes so that's in

1336
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:37,039
the space of biology

1337
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:39,519
uh what about traveling back in time

1338
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,838
yeah that's the um

1339
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,159
that is a natural next question

1340
00:48:41,838 --> 00:48:45,599
especially if you uh if you're doing if

1341
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:47,279
you're going on one of these journeys is

1342
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,800
it a one-way journey yeah can you can

1343
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,480
you come back

1344
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,559
and

1345
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:55,358
the physics community doesn't speak with

1346
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,760
a unified voice on this as yet but i

1347
00:48:55,358 --> 00:49:00,159
would say that the dominant perspective

1348
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,760
is that you cannot get back

1349
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:06,399
now having said that there are proposals

1350
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,200
that serious people have written papers

1351
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,280
on

1352
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:12,318
regarding hypothetical ways in which you

1353
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,240
could travel to the past and

1354
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:16,880
we've seen some of these again hollywood

1355
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:19,919
loves to take the most sexy ideas of

1356
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,200
physics and build narratives around them

1357
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:25,358
this idea of a wormhole like jody foster

1358
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,799
and contact went through a wormhole

1359
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:28,480
deep space nine star i'm sure there are

1360
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,400
many other examples where these ideas

1361
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:33,199
that i've probably never even seen

1362
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,000
but with wormholes there's at least a

1363
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,159
proposal of how you could take a

1364
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:40,400
wormhole tunnel through space-time

1365
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,639
manipulate the openings of the wormhole

1366
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,039
in such a way that the openings are no

1367
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:47,199
longer synchronous they are out of sync

1368
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,199
relative to each other which would mean

1369
00:49:47,199 --> 00:49:50,480
one's ahead and one's behind which means

1370
00:49:49,199 --> 00:49:52,399
if you go through one direction you

1371
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,318
travel to the future if you go back you

1372
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,358
travel to the past

1373
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:58,079
now

1374
00:49:55,358 --> 00:49:59,679
we don't know if there are wormholes

1375
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:01,599
possible according to einstein correct

1376
00:49:59,679 --> 00:50:04,318
they are possible according to einstein

1377
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,480
but even einstein was very quick to say

1378
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,239
just because my math allows for

1379
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,679
something doesn't mean it's real and he

1380
00:50:08,239 --> 00:50:11,519
famously didn't even believe in black

1381
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:14,879
holes yeah didn't believe in the big

1382
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:16,960
bang right and yet the big the the black

1383
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,920
hole issue has really been settled now

1384
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:20,960
we have

1385
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:24,159
radio telescopic photographs of the

1386
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,920
black hole in m87 who's in newspapers

1387
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:27,039
around the world just a couple of years

1388
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,960
ago so

1389
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:31,358
so it's just to say that just because

1390
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,599
it's in einstein's math um it doesn't

1391
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:36,000
mean it's real but yes it is the case

1392
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,000
that wormholes are allowed by einstein's

1393
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,599
equations and in principle

1394
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,679
you can imagine you know putting

1395
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:44,240
electric charges on the openings of the

1396
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:46,078
wormhole allowing you to toe them around

1397
00:50:44,239 --> 00:50:48,239
in a manner that could yield this

1398
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:50,400
temporal asymmetry between them maybe

1399
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:52,719
you toe one of the mouths to the edge of

1400
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,440
a black hole in principle you can do

1401
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:57,199
this slowing down the passage of time

1402
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,000
near that black hole and then when you

1403
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:02,078
bring it back it will be well out of

1404
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,239
sync with the other opening and

1405
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,960
therefore could be a significant

1406
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:09,118
temporal gap between one and the other

1407
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,599
but people have studied this in more

1408
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:14,559
detail questioned could you ever keep a

1409
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:17,359
wormhole open assuming it does exist

1410
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,760
could you ever travel through a wormhole

1411
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:22,799
or would there be a requirement of some

1412
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,200
kind of exotic matter to prop it open

1413
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:27,200
that perhaps doesn't exist so

1414
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:29,118
there are many many issues that people

1415
00:51:27,199 --> 00:51:30,879
have raised and i would say that the

1416
00:51:29,119 --> 00:51:32,960
general sentiment

1417
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:35,200
is that it's unlikely

1418
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,358
that this kind of scenario is going to

1419
00:51:35,199 --> 00:51:39,358
survive our deeper understanding of

1420
00:51:37,358 --> 00:51:41,358
physics when we finally have it but that

1421
00:51:39,358 --> 00:51:42,558
doesn't mean that the door is closed so

1422
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:45,279
maybe it's a

1423
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,400
a small possibility that this could one

1424
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,599
day be ready that's such an interesting

1425
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:50,000
way to put it

1426
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,000
it will not this kind of scenario will

1427
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,358
not survive deep understanding of

1428
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,719
physics

1429
00:51:53,358 --> 00:51:56,880
it's an interesting way to put it

1430
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:58,239
because

1431
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,599
it makes you wonder what kind of

1432
00:51:58,239 --> 00:52:02,000
scenarios

1433
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,440
will be created by our deeper

1434
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:06,318
understanding of physics maybe

1435
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,559
uh

1436
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:11,119
sorry to go crazy for a second but if

1437
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,839
you have like the pan psychosome idea

1438
00:52:11,119 --> 00:52:14,559
that

1439
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:17,039
consciousness permeates all matter maybe

1440
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,359
traveling in that whatever laws of

1441
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,199
physics the consciousness operates under

1442
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:22,639
something like that in that view of the

1443
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:25,519
universe if we somehow are able to

1444
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:28,400
understand that part maybe traveling is

1445
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:30,318
super easy yeah

1446
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,760
it does not follow the constraints of

1447
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:33,838
the speed of light

1448
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:36,240
something like this yeah so

1449
00:52:33,838 --> 00:52:37,838
look i have i have a definite

1450
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:40,000
degree of um

1451
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:43,759
sympathy with the possibility

1452
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:46,000
that consciousness might be more than

1453
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,319
what we described earlier is just the

1454
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,400
byproduct of mindless particles you just

1455
00:52:48,318 --> 00:52:52,719
made the rock happy

1456
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,039
exactly you know so so

1457
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:57,919
it isn't the approach that

1458
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:59,519
feels to me the the most likely but i i

1459
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,480
see the logic

1460
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:05,440
if you've got the puzzle how do mindless

1461
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:08,159
particles build mind one resolution

1462
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,440
might be the particles are not mindless

1463
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,519
the particles have some kind of

1464
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,358
proto-conscious quality so there's

1465
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:16,079
there's something appealing about that

1466
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:18,239
straightforward solution to the puzzle

1467
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:21,039
and if that's the case if we do live in

1468
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:23,039
a pan-psychist world where there's a

1469
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:24,719
degree of consciousness residing in

1470
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:26,558
everything in the world around us then

1471
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:28,719
yes i do think some

1472
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,680
interesting possibilities might emerge

1473
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:34,239
where maybe there's a way of communing

1474
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:36,799
with physical reality

1475
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:39,439
in a in a deeper way than we have so far

1476
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,920
i mean we as human beings a vital part

1477
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,800
of our existence is human to human

1478
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:46,400
communication contact we live in social

1479
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,800
groups and that's what it's allowed us

1480
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,920
to get to the place where we've gotten

1481
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:52,400
imagine

1482
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,039
that we have long missed that there's

1483
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:57,519
other consciousness out there and some

1484
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:00,000
kind of relationship or communion with

1485
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:02,639
that larger conscious possibility would

1486
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,639
take us to a different place now do i do

1487
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:06,400
i buy into this yet i don't i don't see

1488
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,960
any evidence for it

1489
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:13,358
but do i have an open mind and allow for

1490
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:15,760
the possibility in the future yeah i do

1491
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:16,719
so if that's not the case and you have

1492
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,079
these

1493
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:22,000
simple particles that at the macro level

1494
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:24,400
emerges some interesting stuff like

1495
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,280
consciousness another thing you write

1496
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,920
about in the until the end of time book

1497
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:32,400
is the the thing that seems to emerge at

1498
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,800
the macro level is the feeling

1499
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:36,720
like uh that like there's a free will

1500
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:39,039
like we decide to do stuff and you have

1501
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:41,519
a really interesting take here

1502
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:43,599
which is

1503
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:44,719
no there's not a free will i'm just

1504
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:46,798
going to speak for you and then you

1505
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:48,000
should correct me no there's not a free

1506
00:54:46,798 --> 00:54:49,599
will

1507
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,719
but there is

1508
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,079
an experience of freedom yeah

1509
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,879
yeah

1510
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:58,240
which i i really love so where does the

1511
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:00,160
experience

1512
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:02,639
where does freedom come from if we don't

1513
00:55:00,159 --> 00:55:05,759
have any kind of physics based free will

1514
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:07,358
yeah and and so the idea

1515
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,960
follows naturally from all that we've

1516
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:10,480
been talking about let's make the

1517
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:12,480
assumption

1518
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:15,358
that all there is in the physical

1519
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,280
universe is stuff governed by laws we

1520
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,440
may not have those laws may may not know

1521
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,400
what the fundamental stuff is yet

1522
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:24,318
but everything we know in science points

1523
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:27,760
in the direction that it's physical

1524
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:28,558
stuff governed by universal laws

1525
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:30,559
and

1526
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,040
that being the case or that being the

1527
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:34,880
assumption then you come to a particular

1528
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:37,440
collection of those ingredients called a

1529
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,920
human being and that human being has

1530
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,519
particles that are fully governed by

1531
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,280
physical law

1532
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:45,440
and when you then recognize that every

1533
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:48,240
thought that we have every action that

1534
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:50,318
we undertake is just the motion of

1535
00:55:48,239 --> 00:55:52,639
particles when i'm thinking thoughts

1536
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:54,880
right now of course at this level of

1537
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:57,679
description it is the motion of

1538
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,559
particles cascading down various neurons

1539
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:03,759
inside of my head and so on and every

1540
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:07,280
single one of those motions collectively

1541
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:09,520
and individually is fully governed by

1542
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,160
these laws that we perhaps don't have

1543
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:15,119
yet but we imagine one day we will that

1544
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:17,118
leaves no opportunity for any kind of

1545
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,079
freedom to break free from the

1546
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,519
constraint of physical law and that is

1547
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,839
the end of the story

1548
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:25,280
so the traditional intuitive notion of

1549
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:27,358
free will that we're the ultimate

1550
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,160
authors of our actions that we were the

1551
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:33,679
buck stops that there is no antecedent

1552
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:36,159
that is the cause for our decided to go

1553
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:38,159
left or right choose vanilla or

1554
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:41,358
chocolate live or die

1555
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:42,719
that intuitive sensation does not have a

1556
00:56:41,358 --> 00:56:45,279
basis in our understanding of the

1557
00:56:42,719 --> 00:56:47,118
physical world so that's the end of the

1558
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,880
free will of the traditional sort but

1559
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:50,720
then your question is

1560
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:53,838
what about this other kind of freedom i

1561
00:56:50,719 --> 00:56:56,959
talk about and the other kind of freedom

1562
00:56:53,838 --> 00:57:00,639
if you focus on it intently i think

1563
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:04,079
is actually the true version of freedom

1564
00:57:00,639 --> 00:57:06,159
that we feel and that freedom is this

1565
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:10,079
you look at inanimate objects in the

1566
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:12,318
world rocks bottles of water whatever

1567
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,079
they have a very limited behavioral

1568
00:57:12,318 --> 00:57:16,239
repertoire why

1569
00:57:14,079 --> 00:57:18,720
their internal organization is too

1570
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:20,000
coarse for them to do very much right

1571
00:57:18,719 --> 00:57:22,159
you have to you try to have a

1572
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,639
conversation with a glass of water you

1573
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:26,558
send sound waves it doesn't do much it

1574
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:28,879
may vibrate a little bit but the

1575
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:30,000
repertoire of responses are incredibly

1576
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,000
limited

1577
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:34,000
the difference between us and a rock or

1578
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,559
a bottle of water is that our inner

1579
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,199
organization by virtue of eons of

1580
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:42,880
evolution by natural selection is so

1581
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:46,879
refined so spectacularly ordered that we

1582
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:49,838
have a huge repertoire of behaviors that

1583
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,318
are finely attuned to stimuli from the

1584
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:54,318
external world you ask me a question

1585
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,719
that's a stimulus and all of a sudden

1586
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:57,759
these particle processes go into action

1587
00:57:56,719 --> 00:57:59,439
and this

1588
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,000
is the result this answer that i'm

1589
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:05,440
giving you so the freedom that we have

1590
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,880
is not from the control of physical law

1591
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:09,358
the freedom that we have is from the

1592
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,680
constrained behavior that has long since

1593
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:13,920
governed inanimate objects we are

1594
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:17,039
liberated from the limited behavioral

1595
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,920
repertoire of rocks and bottles of water

1596
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:22,480
to have this broad spectrum of responses

1597
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:24,318
do we pick them we do not do we freely

1598
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:27,280
choose them we do not

1599
00:58:24,318 --> 00:58:29,838
but yet we have them and we can marvel

1600
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:32,480
at those behaviors and that's the

1601
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:35,039
freedom that we have the complexity and

1602
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,119
the breadth of that repertoire is is

1603
00:58:35,039 --> 00:58:38,558
where the freedom is is there something

1604
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,079
to be said about

1605
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:41,519
emergence

1606
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,599
i don't know if you

1607
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,318
know i've looked at much about objects

1608
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,838
that

1609
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:47,519
i seem to uh

1610
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:48,639
love way more than anyone else which is

1611
00:58:47,519 --> 00:58:50,880
cellular

1612
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:53,358
yeah like game of life type of stuff

1613
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,720
there you know from simple things

1614
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:56,639
emerges

1615
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,879
beautiful complexities

1616
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,440
and so that's that repertoire

1617
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:04,000
it's like it seems

1618
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:06,400
if you have enough stuff

1619
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:09,440
just beautiful complexity emerges that

1620
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,358
sure as heck to our human eyes looks

1621
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,920
like there's consciousness there there's

1622
00:59:11,358 --> 00:59:16,159
free will there's little objects moving

1623
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,720
about and making decisions i mean all of

1624
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:19,920
that you can say it's

1625
00:59:17,719 --> 00:59:21,759
anthropomorphization but

1626
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,880
it sure as heck feels

1627
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:27,280
like their organisms making decisions

1628
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:28,960
um what what is that that emergence

1629
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,480
thing is is that

1630
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,119
within the realm of physics to

1631
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:35,440
understand is it uh

1632
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,358
is it within the realm of poetry where

1633
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:39,679
because what is that like complex

1634
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:41,598
systems emergencies what is that will

1635
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:43,679
that ever be understood by science so

1636
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,280
here's here's the way that i think about

1637
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:48,078
it so there are

1638
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,880
clearly qualities of the world that

1639
00:59:48,079 --> 00:59:53,680
emerge on macroscopic scales

1640
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,838
our sense of beauty wonder consciousness

1641
00:59:53,679 --> 00:59:58,639
all these kinds of qualities

1642
00:59:55,838 --> 01:00:01,279
do i feel that they ultimately are

1643
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:02,400
explainable from the laws of physics i

1644
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:04,960
do

1645
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,880
there is nothing that's not ultimately

1646
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,798
ultimately explainable with the laws of

1647
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,798
physics from this physicalist

1648
01:00:08,798 --> 01:00:11,838
perspective which is what i take

1649
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:13,838
so

1650
01:00:11,838 --> 01:00:17,119
you got the particles you got the laws

1651
01:00:13,838 --> 01:00:20,639
and you have things that emerge from the

1652
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:23,119
choreographed motions of those particles

1653
01:00:20,639 --> 01:00:26,078
but is that the best language for

1654
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,440
talking about these emergent qualities

1655
01:00:26,079 --> 01:00:28,720
usually not

1656
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:31,119
if i was to

1657
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:33,439
take something even more mundane like a

1658
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,519
baseball flying through the air if i was

1659
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,679
to describe it in terms of the quarks

1660
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:40,719
and the electrons i'd give you this

1661
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:43,679
mountain of data with you know 10 to the

1662
01:00:40,719 --> 01:00:45,519
28 particles and all of their

1663
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:46,798
coordinates in space as a function of

1664
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:49,039
time i hand you this mountain of data to

1665
01:00:46,798 --> 01:00:50,719
be like i don't know what this is

1666
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:53,358
and then if you really were clever and

1667
01:00:50,719 --> 01:00:55,759
looking oh it's a baseball just

1668
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:59,279
described in the in the least economical

1669
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,720
way possible it is much more useful

1670
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,920
and insightful to talk about the

1671
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,000
baseball flying through the air

1672
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,720
similarly there are things at the

1673
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,760
macroscopic level like human experience

1674
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:13,039
and human emotion and human action and

1675
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:15,839
the sensation of free will that we

1676
01:01:13,039 --> 01:01:17,759
undeniably all have even if it itself

1677
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:19,679
doesn't have a basis in our

1678
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:22,480
understanding of the physical world it's

1679
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:23,440
useful to talk about things in this very

1680
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,920
human

1681
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,920
language and so yes it's vital to talk

1682
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,400
about things in the poetic language of

1683
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:32,000
human experience but do not lose sight

1684
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,760
of the fact and some people do they say

1685
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:34,960
oh it's just an emerging phenomenon

1686
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,680
don't lose sight of the fact that

1687
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,838
emergent phenomena are emerging

1688
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:41,838
from this deeper understanding that

1689
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:43,519
comes from the reductionist account of

1690
01:01:41,838 --> 01:01:46,000
physical law and there's a lot of

1691
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:47,759
insight to come from that such as

1692
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,599
the freedom that you thought that you

1693
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:52,160
had the freedom of will that you thought

1694
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:55,838
you had it doesn't have a basis in that

1695
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:55,838
reductionist account so it's not real

1696
01:01:56,159 --> 01:02:00,318
so speaking of the poetry of human

1697
01:01:58,239 --> 01:02:02,000
experience you mentioned the images of

1698
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:04,000
the black holes how did it make you feel

1699
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,559
a few years ago when that first image

1700
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,318
came out it's truly amazing

1701
01:02:06,559 --> 01:02:10,880
a sense of

1702
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:12,960
well i guess the feeling was

1703
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,559
both amazing and and there's a little

1704
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:17,199
sense of um

1705
01:02:14,559 --> 01:02:18,640
jealousy is not quite the right word

1706
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:20,480
but a sense of

1707
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,000
longing yeah i think that's a better

1708
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:24,639
word because

1709
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
here's a subject that started with

1710
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:29,199
einstein back in 1915 writes down the

1711
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:30,559
equations of the general theory of

1712
01:02:29,199 --> 01:02:32,399
relativity

1713
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:34,480
and then there are

1714
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,639
scores of individuals over the decades

1715
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:38,798
you know starting with people like carl

1716
01:02:36,639 --> 01:02:40,239
schwarzschild who analyze the equation

1717
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:42,318
see the possibility of black holes

1718
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:44,078
people develop these ideas john wheeler

1719
01:02:42,318 --> 01:02:46,480
all these greats of physics

1720
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:48,000
it's still a hypothetical subject it

1721
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,400
gets closer to reality through

1722
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,400
observations of the center of our galaxy

1723
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,960
stars whipping around in a manner that

1724
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,400
could only really be explained by there

1725
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:58,639
being a black hole in the center of our

1726
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:01,519
galaxy but it was still indirect

1727
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:03,358
to actually have a direct image

1728
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:06,159
that you can look at

1729
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:08,798
what a beautiful arc narrative arc from

1730
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:11,358
the theoretical to the absolutely

1731
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:13,920
established and that's what we hope will

1732
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:16,239
happen with other areas for instance

1733
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:18,639
string theory right i mean holy

1734
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:20,639
mathematical subject at the outset and

1735
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,480
still pretty much a holy mathematical

1736
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:24,639
subject today

1737
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,719
yeah do we long

1738
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:28,078
for that image where we can look at it

1739
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:31,118
and say

1740
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:33,440
string it's real i mean you know i mean

1741
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,440
how thrilling how thrilling to be part

1742
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,838
of that journey to be part of that that

1743
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:40,240
step that moves things from the abstract

1744
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:42,880
to the concrete

1745
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:45,679
yeah uh so like the image of the dna the

1746
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:47,760
early images of the dna for example uh

1747
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:49,759
but there is something especially so the

1748
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:51,839
problem with strings

1749
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,960
is they're tiny so it's harder to take a

1750
01:03:51,838 --> 01:03:57,038
picture i in in the following sense when

1751
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,358
you think of a black hole i mean you

1752
01:03:57,039 --> 01:04:01,599
have a swirl of i guess what is i i

1753
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:04,558
don't even know it's dust to go whatever

1754
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:06,480
light creeding onto the uh event horizon

1755
01:04:04,559 --> 01:04:08,960
and then there's darkness yeah center

1756
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:12,000
and you you just imagine so that picture

1757
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:15,358
in particular i guess is of a gigantic

1758
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:16,798
black hole so you just i mean it's 10

1759
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:18,719
million billion billions of times the

1760
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:20,639
mass of the sun yeah so it's both

1761
01:04:18,719 --> 01:04:21,519
exciting and terrifying i mean i don't i

1762
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:23,199
don't know where you fall on the

1763
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:25,519
spectrum i think

1764
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:27,118
it's exciting at first like the longer i

1765
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:29,440
think about it every time i think about

1766
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:31,119
it the more terrifying it becomes so it

1767
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,440
always starts exciting

1768
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,318
and then it goes to terrifying and both

1769
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,639
are

1770
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:38,239
feelings very human feelings that i

1771
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,400
appreciate

1772
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:43,118
it's like terrified aw

1773
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,639
somehow it's still beautiful that's a

1774
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,240
good way of saying it i think i kind of

1775
01:04:44,639 --> 01:04:48,078
share that that reaction because there

1776
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:50,159
is a way in which

1777
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:51,200
when you work on this subject like all

1778
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:53,440
the time

1779
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,719
i teach it i teach about black holes

1780
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:59,200
write the equations on the blackboard

1781
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:00,480
the ideas

1782
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:03,199
reside

1783
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,920
in a very cognitive

1784
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:08,879
i don't know mathematical portion of the

1785
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:11,680
brain or at least for me and it's only

1786
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,200
when you like sit down and it's quiet

1787
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,480
and you start to contemplate wait wait

1788
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:17,038
wait wait this is just like a

1789
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:19,599
mathematical game

1790
01:05:17,039 --> 01:05:22,079
there are these monsters out there now i

1791
01:05:19,599 --> 01:05:23,680
don't not in it in a sense of i fear for

1792
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:25,200
my life but it's

1793
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:28,480
a sense of

1794
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:31,118
how extraordinary is this universe and

1795
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:35,199
so it is breathtaking how powerful

1796
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:36,400
nature is yeah how stupendously powerful

1797
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:37,199
nature is

1798
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,039
um

1799
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:40,558
and so there is

1800
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,880
a deep

1801
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:45,599
sense of humility that i think this

1802
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:48,160
instills if you really allow the ideas

1803
01:05:45,599 --> 01:05:50,400
to sink in

1804
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:53,118
well i have to ask about the most

1805
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:54,639
stupendously powerful thing to have ever

1806
01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,318
happened in our universe which is the

1807
01:05:54,639 --> 01:05:58,719
big bang yeah

1808
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:00,480
what's up with the big bang

1809
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:03,519
so we can i mean with gravitational

1810
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,960
waves the hope is when you have

1811
01:06:03,519 --> 01:06:06,480
more and more accurate measurements of

1812
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,240
the gravitational waves you can crawl

1813
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,798
back further and further back in time

1814
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:12,000
towards the big bang

1815
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:13,519
do you ever hope that we'll be able to

1816
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,559
understand

1817
01:06:13,519 --> 01:06:16,960
the

1818
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:18,798
the early spark that created

1819
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:21,199
our universe yeah

1820
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:24,318
you know that and the deep

1821
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:26,798
interior of a black hole i think the the

1822
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:28,639
biggest mysteries that we hope

1823
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:32,719
the melding of quantum mechanics and

1824
01:06:28,639 --> 01:06:35,519
gravity will reveal will illuminate and

1825
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:38,078
you know what question could be

1826
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:40,318
more captivating than why is there

1827
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:43,200
something rather than nothing right why

1828
01:06:40,318 --> 01:06:44,960
is there a universe at all

1829
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:47,279
and will the theories that we're

1830
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,599
developing take us

1831
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:51,359
to an answer to that i don't know

1832
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:53,359
even if we truly knew what the big bang

1833
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:54,719
is that's a big question it's own right

1834
01:06:53,358 --> 01:06:56,558
one would still be left with the

1835
01:06:54,719 --> 01:07:00,239
question well okay

1836
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:02,880
so you've explained the process by which

1837
01:07:00,239 --> 01:07:06,000
a tiny nugget of a

1838
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:08,720
universe a kind of nugget of space-time

1839
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:10,798
can undergo some kind of growth to yield

1840
01:07:08,719 --> 01:07:12,959
the world around us but

1841
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:15,199
presumably in that explanation you're

1842
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,920
going to involve mathematics

1843
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:21,759
and some ingredients like quantum fields

1844
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,440
or or matter or energy or something

1845
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,920
where did that stuff

1846
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:27,519
come from you know can we get to that

1847
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,119
level of explanation i don't know but it

1848
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:30,000
is remarkable

1849
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,798
that

1850
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,960
if you ask what happened

1851
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:35,920
a millionth of a second after the big

1852
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,720
bang

1853
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:40,880
it's not really that controversial

1854
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:43,038
any longer right even though there's a

1855
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,280
lot of argument in the field and it's

1856
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:48,960
very heated right now i should say

1857
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:51,680
regarding what is the right theory of

1858
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:53,838
the big bang what is the right theory of

1859
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:55,440
early universe cosmology where i mean

1860
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:59,038
early much earlier than a millionth of a

1861
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:59,838
second a lot of dissent a lot of

1862
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,000
uh

1863
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:04,798
heated arguments about that no pun

1864
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,798
intended yeah right exactly um but but

1865
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:09,358
but you go like a millionth of a second

1866
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:11,440
after that yeah and and we're on pretty

1867
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:13,519
firm ground isn't that amazing right

1868
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,358
yeah to understand you know what

1869
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:18,238
happened from that point forward

1870
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:20,079
but to go back is is is controversial so

1871
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:21,439
there is this theory called inflationary

1872
01:08:20,079 --> 01:08:23,278
cosmology

1873
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:24,559
which i would say has been the dominant

1874
01:08:23,279 --> 01:08:27,520
paradigm

1875
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:29,199
since uh early 1980s so what does that

1876
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,679
mean roughly 40 years now it's been the

1877
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:33,759
dominant cosmological paradigm and it

1878
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,838
makes use of a curious feature of

1879
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:38,158
einstein's general theory of relativity

1880
01:08:35,838 --> 01:08:40,559
his fear of gravity where einstein shows

1881
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:42,079
us mathematically that gravity can not

1882
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:44,080
only be attractive you know the kind of

1883
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:47,359
gravity that we're used to things pull

1884
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:51,119
together but it can also be repulsive

1885
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:53,920
and that fact is then leveraged by

1886
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:56,158
people like alan guth and and andre

1887
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:58,640
linday and at the time paul steinhardt

1888
01:08:56,158 --> 01:09:00,559
and andres albrecht and others to say

1889
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,400
okay if we had a little nugget in the

1890
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,080
earlier universe which was

1891
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:06,000
filled with the stuff that yields this

1892
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:07,679
repulsive gravity well that would have

1893
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:09,119
blown everything apart it would cause

1894
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:11,359
everything to swell

1895
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:14,318
beautiful explanation for what the bang

1896
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:16,640
in the big bang was and then people

1897
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,960
mathematically analyze the consequences

1898
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:21,759
of this idea and they make predictions

1899
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,679
for tiny temperature differences across

1900
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,640
the night sky that in principle could be

1901
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,239
measured

1902
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,480
you send up balloons you set up

1903
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:29,838
satellites with very refined

1904
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:31,759
thermometers

1905
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:34,000
and they measured the temperature of the

1906
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,359
night sky and the statistical

1907
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,198
distribution of the temperature

1908
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:39,759
differences agrees with the mathematical

1909
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,719
predictions yeah

1910
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,000
i mean

1911
01:09:40,719 --> 01:09:43,359
it's amazing you just sort of have to

1912
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:45,679
stand in awe

1913
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:49,600
of this insight so you think

1914
01:09:45,679 --> 01:09:51,039
aha the theory has been established but

1915
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:53,120
scientists are

1916
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:54,079
an incredibly skeptical

1917
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:56,238
bunch

1918
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:57,679
and some scientists including one of the

1919
01:09:56,238 --> 01:09:59,919
people who helped develop the theory at

1920
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:02,239
the outset paul steinhardt

1921
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,000
comes along and says well yeah it's done

1922
01:10:02,238 --> 01:10:06,399
this theory's done pretty well so far

1923
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,238
but there are aspects of this theory

1924
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:10,639
that are making me lose confidence for

1925
01:10:08,238 --> 01:10:13,279
instance this theory seems to suggest

1926
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:15,199
that there might be other universes

1927
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:17,439
like how do you make sense of a theory

1928
01:10:15,198 --> 01:10:18,799
that suggests other universes or or

1929
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:20,960
there are others who come along and say

1930
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,320
this theory seems to um

1931
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,198
talk about

1932
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:27,198
length scales that are minuscule even by

1933
01:10:25,198 --> 01:10:29,198
the so-called plank length the sort of

1934
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:30,960
shortest length that we can imagine

1935
01:10:29,198 --> 01:10:33,279
making sense of in a theory of quantum

1936
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:36,158
gravity how do you make sense of that

1937
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:38,399
and so and so they develop a list of of

1938
01:10:36,158 --> 01:10:41,119
things that they consider to be chinks

1939
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:43,519
in the inflationary cosmological

1940
01:10:41,119 --> 01:10:45,920
theories armor and they develop other

1941
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,920
ideas which they claim

1942
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:49,119
yield the same predictions as inflation

1943
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,359
and cosmology for those temperature

1944
01:10:49,119 --> 01:10:53,198
differences across space but don't

1945
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:55,519
suffer from these problems and then the

1946
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:57,839
inflationary cosmology folks say no no

1947
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,080
no hang on you know your theories

1948
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:02,480
suffers from different problems and so

1949
01:11:00,079 --> 01:11:04,960
the arguments goes it's a healthy debate

1950
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:06,799
talk about real debates and science

1951
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,679
so when you ask what's up with the big

1952
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,239
bang

1953
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,800
i don't know right now um if you would

1954
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:14,639
have asked me five years ago

1955
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,159
maybe even less than that three or four

1956
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,039
years ago i've said look

1957
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:21,198
inflation on cosmology has some issues

1958
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:23,439
but the package of explanations it

1959
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:26,960
provides is so potent

1960
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:28,960
and the issues that beset it are

1961
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:30,800
seemingly solvable to me

1962
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,719
that i would imagine it's going to in

1963
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,320
the end win out

1964
01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:36,640
i would still say that today but i

1965
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:39,519
wouldn't say it as loudly i wouldn't say

1966
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:42,239
it as confidently i think it's worth

1967
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:44,320
thinking about alternate ideas and it

1968
01:11:42,238 --> 01:11:46,799
could be the case that the paradigm at

1969
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:48,799
some point shifts

1970
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,840
does dark matter and dark energy fit

1971
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:52,400
into the

1972
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:55,760
shifting of the explanations for those

1973
01:11:52,399 --> 01:11:58,319
yeah certainly so so dark energy has uh

1974
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:00,159
in in the inflationary theory

1975
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:01,359
is kind of a big mystery

1976
01:12:00,158 --> 01:12:03,119
so

1977
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:04,719
dark energy is the

1978
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:07,198
observational

1979
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:09,520
realization in the last 20 years that

1980
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:11,519
not only is the universe expanding it's

1981
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,840
expanding ever more quickly

1982
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:16,480
something is still pushing things

1983
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:18,400
outward and the explanation is that

1984
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:20,000
there's like a residual version of the

1985
01:12:18,399 --> 01:12:22,799
repulsive gravity from the early

1986
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:25,039
universe but it's such a strange number

1987
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,600
when you write that amount of dark

1988
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:29,840
energy using the relevant units in the

1989
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:32,960
theory of quantum gravity it's a decimal

1990
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:34,480
point followed by like 120 zeros and

1991
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:37,439
then a one

1992
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:39,599
we're not used to those kinds of numbers

1993
01:12:37,439 --> 01:12:41,439
in physics we're used to

1994
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:42,320
a half

1995
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:43,198
one

1996
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:45,599
pi

1997
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:48,079
e square to two those are the kinds of

1998
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,480
fundamental numbers that emerge in our

1999
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:52,719
explanations of the world and we look at

2000
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:55,039
this bizarre number decimal point all

2001
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,960
these zeros and one we say

2002
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:58,319
something's wrong there like where would

2003
01:12:56,960 --> 01:13:00,480
that number

2004
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,000
have come from now there are people who

2005
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:04,559
suggest resolution to it so it's not

2006
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:06,640
like we're totally in the dark on it but

2007
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:09,039
those people like paul steinhardt who

2008
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:12,000
have alternate cosmological theories

2009
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:13,359
cyclic cosmologies as they call it claim

2010
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:16,079
that they have a more natural

2011
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:19,279
explanation of the dark energy that it

2012
01:13:16,079 --> 01:13:20,158
naturally feeds into a cyclical process

2013
01:13:19,279 --> 01:13:23,439
that

2014
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:24,559
is their cosmological paradigm so yeah

2015
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:26,960
if the

2016
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:30,320
cosmology should change it's conceivable

2017
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:32,399
our view of dark energy may change from

2018
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:34,479
deeply mysterious to deeply integrate it

2019
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:37,039
into a different paradigm that is

2020
01:13:34,479 --> 01:13:39,359
possible i think it's roger penrose that

2021
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:41,039
think that information can bleed through

2022
01:13:39,359 --> 01:13:43,519
from before the big bang to the after

2023
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:44,800
the big bang yeah is that uh is the big

2024
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:46,880
bang uh

2025
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:48,159
like a full erasure of the hard drive or

2026
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,440
is there some information that could

2027
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:54,000
bleed through yeah i mean so sir roger

2028
01:13:51,439 --> 01:13:56,879
is among the most creative thinkers of

2029
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,198
the last 100 years rightly

2030
01:13:56,880 --> 01:14:02,800
won the nobel prize for his insights

2031
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:05,919
into singularities in space time that

2032
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:07,440
we know to afflict our mathematical

2033
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:09,359
solutions of black holes in the big bang

2034
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:13,359
and so forth and um

2035
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:15,599
he has an enormously fertile imagination

2036
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:18,960
and and i mean that in the most positive

2037
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:21,920
sense and um so he has put forward this

2038
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:23,600
idea this conformal cyclic cosmology i

2039
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,158
think is the uh the official title

2040
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:28,079
although i could be getting that wrong

2041
01:14:26,158 --> 01:14:28,879
i can't say that i've studied it i have

2042
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:31,600
seen

2043
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:34,560
lectures on it i don't find it

2044
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,159
convincing as yet it feels

2045
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,360
like it's being

2046
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:39,519
built

2047
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:42,079
to find a solution as opposed to sort of

2048
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:44,000
more naturally emerging

2049
01:14:42,079 --> 01:14:46,960
maybe roger would say otherwise and i

2050
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:49,119
don't mean to in any way

2051
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:50,399
cast aspersions on the work it's vital

2052
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:53,840
and interesting and people are thinking

2053
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:55,279
about it i don't consider it as close a

2054
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:57,520
competitor

2055
01:14:55,279 --> 01:14:59,920
to say the inflationary theory as for

2056
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,520
instance the stuff that paul steinhardt

2057
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:03,679
has put forward but

2058
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:05,280
again you've got you got to keep an open

2059
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:06,960
mind in this in this business when

2060
01:15:05,279 --> 01:15:08,639
there's so much that we don't yet

2061
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:10,319
understand i mean it is wild to think

2062
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:12,000
that information can survive something

2063
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:13,840
like that just like

2064
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:16,399
it is wild to imagine that information

2065
01:15:13,840 --> 01:15:19,119
could escape a black hole for example or

2066
01:15:16,399 --> 01:15:20,639
it just seems like

2067
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:22,800
by construction these things are

2068
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,480
supposed to not

2069
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,000
bleed out anything but one of the

2070
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:27,839
challenges in all these theories is when

2071
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,079
we talk about a singularity has this

2072
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,719
really sexy term the singularity yeah

2073
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:35,198
but a singularity is is in more ordinary

2074
01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:35,198
language

2075
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:39,599
a physical system where the mathematics

2076
01:15:38,158 --> 01:15:41,759
breaks down

2077
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:43,520
it's nonsensical it's like taking one

2078
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,679
divided by zero you put that into a

2079
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:48,320
calculator and it says e error right it

2080
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:50,719
does not make sense doesn't compute and

2081
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:51,679
and so it's very hard

2082
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:52,560
to

2083
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,399
make

2084
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,880
definitive statements about things like

2085
01:15:54,399 --> 01:16:00,238
the big bang or about black holes until

2086
01:15:56,880 --> 01:16:02,159
we cure the mathematical singularities

2087
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:04,639
and there are some who claim that in

2088
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:07,599
certain regimes the singularities have

2089
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:10,560
been cured i don't by any means think

2090
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:12,480
that there's consensus on these ideas so

2091
01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:13,840
when one talks about information sort of

2092
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:15,678
bleeding through the big bang you've

2093
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,440
really got to make sure that the

2094
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:18,880
equations have no singularity you talk

2095
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:20,719
about cyclic cosmology you've got to

2096
01:16:18,880 --> 01:16:22,719
make sure that the equations don't have

2097
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,640
any singularities as you go from say one

2098
01:16:22,719 --> 01:16:26,079
cycle to the next now some of the

2099
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,400
proponents of these theories claim that

2100
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:30,559
they have resolved these issues i i

2101
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:32,319
don't think that there's a general sense

2102
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:35,199
that that is the case as yet but it

2103
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:37,279
could be that look i life is so short

2104
01:16:35,198 --> 01:16:38,719
that i i haven't had the time to deeply

2105
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:40,238
delve into all the mathematical

2106
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,920
intricacies of all the ideas that have

2107
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:43,119
been put forward if i did that i'd never

2108
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:44,800
do anything else

2109
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:49,039
but that that's what the issue is and of

2110
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:50,640
course it's just math there may be holes

2111
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:52,079
there may be uh

2112
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:54,159
there may be gaps in our our

2113
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:55,679
understanding in the way we're modeling

2114
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:57,039
physical variables well that's the point

2115
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:58,719
in fact when you said i was about to

2116
01:16:57,039 --> 01:17:00,840
jump in and say modeling but you got

2117
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,960
there first and it's exactly the right

2118
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,000
point you're talking about the universe

2119
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:05,279
here

2120
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,479
right and the

2121
01:17:05,279 --> 01:17:08,158
how do you how do you talk about the

2122
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:10,158
universe with a straight face

2123
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:11,920
mathematically and the way you do it is

2124
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:14,079
you you simplify

2125
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:15,359
you throw away those characteristics of

2126
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:19,359
the universe that you don't think are

2127
01:17:15,359 --> 01:17:20,799
vital to a full understanding and so

2128
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:22,719
we're going to get to a point people are

2129
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:24,640
starting to where we've got to go beyond

2130
01:17:22,719 --> 01:17:28,079
those simplifications

2131
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:29,679
and so cosmology has for a long time

2132
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:33,198
modeled the universe in the most

2133
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:35,039
simplest terms homogeneous isotropic

2134
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:37,279
it has just a few parameters that

2135
01:17:35,039 --> 01:17:38,880
describe it the average density of mass

2136
01:17:37,279 --> 01:17:40,479
and energy and so forth we have to go

2137
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,920
beyond those simplifications and that

2138
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,439
will require

2139
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,880
putting these things on computers we're

2140
01:17:43,439 --> 01:17:46,559
not going to be able to do calculations

2141
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,800
there so much as

2142
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:50,560
astrophysics has gone beyond many

2143
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:53,279
simplifications to now give really

2144
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:55,360
detailed simulations of star systems and

2145
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:56,800
galaxies and so forth we're going to

2146
01:17:55,359 --> 01:17:58,960
have to do that with cosmology and

2147
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,640
people are starting to do that today

2148
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:03,039
yeah i've seen some interesting work on

2149
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:04,880
uh simulation

2150
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:06,319
most simulation cosmology by the way is

2151
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,840
just awesome but

2152
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:10,158
you know just like simulation of the

2153
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,360
early formation of our solar system to

2154
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:14,079
understand

2155
01:18:11,359 --> 01:18:16,719
how the like the ore cloud and just

2156
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,399
i don't know the the whole of it the how

2157
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:20,960
earth came to be yeah

2158
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:22,960
like how jupiter just

2159
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:25,600
protects us protects us and then there's

2160
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:27,119
like weird like

2161
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,960
moons and

2162
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,559
volcanoes and

2163
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,399
and like modeling all of that the

2164
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,440
formation of all that

2165
01:18:32,399 --> 01:18:37,839
uh is fascinating yeah because that

2166
01:18:35,439 --> 01:18:41,039
naturally is the question of how does

2167
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:43,840
life emerge and these kinds of rocks

2168
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:45,359
how does a rock become a rabbit yeah

2169
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,679
uh but

2170
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:50,158
speaking of models uh there's an

2171
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:52,640
equation called the drake equation

2172
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:55,119
we were talking about life

2173
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:57,920
have to ask when you're at the highest

2174
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:59,840
level first when you look out there

2175
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,840
how many alien civilizations do you

2176
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:04,640
think are out there

2177
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:05,520
zero one or many

2178
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:06,840
so

2179
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,960
if you say

2180
01:19:06,840 --> 01:19:12,319
civilization i

2181
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:14,880
would bring my number way down

2182
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:17,519
it could be zero

2183
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,319
if you talk about life

2184
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:22,480
i think it could be many

2185
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:24,399
as we were saying before i think the

2186
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:26,479
move from life

2187
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:28,879
to consciousness the kinds of beings

2188
01:19:26,479 --> 01:19:30,718
that would build what we would recognize

2189
01:19:28,880 --> 01:19:33,520
as a civilization

2190
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:36,880
that may be extraordinarily

2191
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:39,440
rare i hope it's not you know as a kid i

2192
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,520
love star trek i i just love the idea

2193
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:44,639
that we would be part of some

2194
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:46,400
universal community where look

2195
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,719
experience on planet earth suggests it

2196
01:19:46,399 --> 01:19:50,799
doesn't always go so well when groups

2197
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:53,600
who are separated try to come together

2198
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:55,920
and and live in some larger collective

2199
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,920
but again as an optimist

2200
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,920
how amazing would it be to converse with

2201
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:02,560
an alien civilization and and learn what

2202
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:05,679
they've figured out about physics and

2203
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:07,760
cosmology and and compare notes and and

2204
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:10,399
and learn from each other in in some

2205
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:13,600
some wonderful way i i love that idea

2206
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:15,679
but if you ask me the likelihood of it

2207
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:18,400
i i would err on saying

2208
01:20:15,679 --> 01:20:21,279
it may be so improbable

2209
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:24,000
that the conditions conspire to allow

2210
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:26,960
life to move to this place of of

2211
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,880
consciousness that it might be rare

2212
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,480
it might be oversimplifying things but

2213
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:32,400
just observing the power of the

2214
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:34,158
evolutionary process

2215
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:36,559
i tend to believe

2216
01:20:34,158 --> 01:20:39,279
and like you read

2217
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,480
different theories of how we went

2218
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:43,119
uh

2219
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:45,439
how homo sapiens evolved

2220
01:20:43,119 --> 01:20:47,359
it seems like the evolutionary process

2221
01:20:45,439 --> 01:20:48,399
naturally leads to

2222
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:49,920
to

2223
01:20:48,399 --> 01:20:52,158
homo sapiens

2224
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:55,039
or creatures like that or much better

2225
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:59,198
than that so to me the

2226
01:20:55,039 --> 01:21:01,439
there's several scary scenarios so

2227
01:20:59,198 --> 01:21:03,519
okay the positive scenario is life

2228
01:21:01,439 --> 01:21:06,000
itself is really difficult so that

2229
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:08,000
origin of life is difficult that's

2230
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:08,960
exciting for many reasons

2231
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,760
because

2232
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:14,158
we might be able to prove that wrong

2233
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:15,840
easily in the near term by finding life

2234
01:21:14,158 --> 01:21:19,359
elsewhere sure

2235
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:21,279
the scary thing to me is if uh

2236
01:21:19,359 --> 01:21:23,759
life is easy

2237
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:26,800
and there's plenty of conscious

2238
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:28,480
intelligent civilizations out there and

2239
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:31,760
we have not

2240
01:21:28,479 --> 01:21:34,399
obviously made contact which means with

2241
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:37,119
intelligence and consciousness comes

2242
01:21:34,399 --> 01:21:38,559
responsibility and

2243
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:39,920
ultimately

2244
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:42,880
destruction

2245
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:44,719
so with power comes great responsibility

2246
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,719
and then we end up destroying ourselves

2247
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:48,960
that's the

2248
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:51,198
uh the scariest the the positive i guess

2249
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:53,840
version is that

2250
01:21:51,198 --> 01:21:55,279
maybe we're being watched

2251
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,039
uh sort of like

2252
01:21:55,279 --> 01:21:59,279
there's a transition

2253
01:21:57,039 --> 01:22:01,439
to where you don't want to ruin

2254
01:21:59,279 --> 01:22:04,079
uh the primitive villages out there and

2255
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:06,479
so there's a protective layer around us

2256
01:22:04,079 --> 01:22:08,880
yeah they're they're watching

2257
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:10,559
so where where do you and these possible

2258
01:22:08,880 --> 01:22:12,639
explanations to the fermi paradox why

2259
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,880
haven't we contacted aliens

2260
01:22:12,639 --> 01:22:16,560
do you land on well

2261
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:20,239
i think the most straightforward

2262
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:21,120
explanation is that there aren't any

2263
01:22:20,238 --> 01:22:23,198
now

2264
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:25,439
there are many other explanations too so

2265
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:27,599
i you can't be dogmatic about things

2266
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:28,479
that are just sort of gut feel

2267
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:30,400
but

2268
01:22:28,479 --> 01:22:32,638
you know one of my favorite

2269
01:22:30,399 --> 01:22:34,000
twilight zone episodes i don't ever saw

2270
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:36,319
this one where

2271
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:39,279
this alien civilization finally comes to

2272
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:42,079
planet earth and gives us this book that

2273
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:44,238
they really want us to to have and to

2274
01:22:42,079 --> 01:22:45,679
hold and it's in this foreign you know

2275
01:22:44,238 --> 01:22:48,238
language you don't understand the

2276
01:22:45,679 --> 01:22:51,039
cryptographers they desperately try to

2277
01:22:48,238 --> 01:22:52,559
decipher it as humans are going to visit

2278
01:22:51,039 --> 01:22:54,319
this other alien planet and they're all

2279
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:57,440
sending back postcards how wonderful it

2280
01:22:54,319 --> 01:23:00,319
is and so forth and they they finally

2281
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:01,919
decipher the title it's to serve man and

2282
01:23:00,319 --> 01:23:04,000
everyone's so thrilled oh they're here

2283
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:06,158
to service it all makes sense and then

2284
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:08,079
just as one of the final cryptographers

2285
01:23:06,158 --> 01:23:10,960
is going on to the alien ship

2286
01:23:08,079 --> 01:23:13,359
his his helper runs and says i've

2287
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:16,960
deciphered the rest of the book to serve

2288
01:23:13,359 --> 01:23:17,759
man it's a cookbook you know so

2289
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,158
you know

2290
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:22,800
so yeah is that is that a

2291
01:23:20,158 --> 01:23:24,238
possibility sure you know and and so

2292
01:23:22,800 --> 01:23:27,279
could they be watching us and just sort

2293
01:23:24,238 --> 01:23:28,479
of waiting for us to uh get to a mature

2294
01:23:27,279 --> 01:23:29,519
enough

2295
01:23:28,479 --> 01:23:31,439
level

2296
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:32,639
i don't know it strikes me well you know

2297
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,319
i think it'd be better to have this

2298
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:36,719
conversation after the james webb

2299
01:23:34,319 --> 01:23:39,920
telescope i mean i do think that

2300
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:41,840
um if we look at the atmospheres

2301
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:45,039
of many planets i mean there's now an

2302
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:48,319
estimate now that there's on order of

2303
01:23:45,039 --> 01:23:50,639
one planet per star on average so we've

2304
01:23:48,319 --> 01:23:53,119
long known that you know the galaxy

2305
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:54,239
hundreds of billions of stars numbers of

2306
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:56,158
galaxies hundreds of billions of

2307
01:23:54,238 --> 01:23:57,439
galaxies so we're talking about hundreds

2308
01:23:56,158 --> 01:23:59,359
of billions of hundreds of billions of

2309
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:02,158
planets i'm like you know and if we

2310
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:03,679
start to survey some of these planets

2311
01:24:02,158 --> 01:24:05,198
and one after the other after the other

2312
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:07,520
we just sort of find

2313
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:10,559
no evidence for

2314
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:12,400
any of the biological markers it could

2315
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:14,400
be of course maybe life takes a

2316
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:16,799
radically different form it'd be hard to

2317
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:18,319
know that but i think you know that

2318
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,880
would at least give us some insight on

2319
01:24:18,319 --> 01:24:23,279
the life question but i just don't see

2320
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:25,440
how we get insight on the civilization

2321
01:24:23,279 --> 01:24:28,000
or consciousness question without you

2322
01:24:25,439 --> 01:24:30,559
know the direct connection and and it

2323
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,399
strikes me that if consciousness is

2324
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:34,560
ubiquitous

2325
01:24:32,399 --> 01:24:37,279
let's say life is i'm willing to grant

2326
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:40,480
that if consciousness is also ubiquitous

2327
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:42,158
then i don't understand why

2328
01:24:40,479 --> 01:24:45,439
they haven't been here or why there

2329
01:24:42,158 --> 01:24:47,839
hasn't been separate because presumably

2330
01:24:45,439 --> 01:24:50,079
they should be much further ahead of us

2331
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,920
how unlikely would it be that we're like

2332
01:24:50,079 --> 01:24:53,840
of all consciousness in the universe

2333
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:55,679
we're the most advanced that would be

2334
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,440
such a special

2335
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,359
place for human beings that it's hard

2336
01:24:57,439 --> 01:25:01,279
for me to grant that as a likely

2337
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:02,559
possibility rather i think we're kind of

2338
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:04,079
running the mill

2339
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,639
and there are many who are far more

2340
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:07,519
advanced than us and i don't think that

2341
01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:09,520
they

2342
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,199
would expend the energy to hide

2343
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:13,520
themselves

2344
01:25:11,198 --> 01:25:15,759
so i don't think they care enough and so

2345
01:25:13,520 --> 01:25:18,400
i see that's actually what i i believe

2346
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:20,000
that there's uh a very large number of

2347
01:25:18,399 --> 01:25:21,439
civilizations that are far more advanced

2348
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,760
than us

2349
01:25:21,439 --> 01:25:26,399
but my sense is the humans are

2350
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:29,199
exceptionally limited both in our direct

2351
01:25:26,399 --> 01:25:30,319
sensory capabilities and our physics

2352
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:32,638
our tools

2353
01:25:30,319 --> 01:25:33,599
of sensing that just like with the

2354
01:25:32,639 --> 01:25:36,000
string theory and the multiple

2355
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:38,400
dimensions we're just not

2356
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,560
like it's like i honestly believe there

2357
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:43,279
could be stuff in front of our nose that

2358
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:46,320
we're just not seeing

2359
01:25:43,279 --> 01:25:48,880
what because we're too dumb too

2360
01:25:46,319 --> 01:25:51,198
uh too much hubris

2361
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:52,719
and i mean it's a bunch of stuff and too

2362
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:53,839
ignorant as a

2363
01:25:52,719 --> 01:25:55,760
to the

2364
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:58,159
fabric of reality all of those things

2365
01:25:55,760 --> 01:25:59,840
yeah we're young

2366
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,759
yeah in terms of intelligence but i

2367
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:04,000
guess what i'd say is like i'm on board

2368
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,520
with all of that as a real possibility

2369
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:07,359
but then

2370
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,360
it does strike me that

2371
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:11,119
we are sufficiently

2372
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:13,679
able to observe

2373
01:26:11,119 --> 01:26:14,719
the unit look we can look back to

2374
01:26:13,679 --> 01:26:17,600
you know

2375
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:19,920
a fraction of the duration

2376
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:24,239
from here to just a fraction is left

2377
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:26,239
that we are unable to see um so however

2378
01:26:24,238 --> 01:26:28,559
young we are

2379
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:31,039
we have been able to sort of pierce the

2380
01:26:28,560 --> 01:26:33,840
universe and it just strikes me that

2381
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:35,920
there would be some signature but maybe

2382
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,760
maybe that that's coming but but look

2383
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:40,239
having said that i do

2384
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:43,920
look i i i certainly note the fact that

2385
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:46,479
it's rare that i stoop down

2386
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:49,039
while walking in manhattan and sort of

2387
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:51,039
dig up some ants in the bushes on the

2388
01:26:49,039 --> 01:26:52,639
side of the street and talk to the ants

2389
01:26:51,039 --> 01:26:54,238
right because it's just not interesting

2390
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:56,560
to me so if we're like the ants on the

2391
01:26:54,238 --> 01:26:58,559
cosmological landscape then yeah i can

2392
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,760
imagine that the super advanced aliens

2393
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,719
would be like

2394
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:04,320
like whoever you know but but i feel

2395
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:06,560
like we're sufficiently advanced that

2396
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:08,719
there should be some signal signature of

2397
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:10,560
that but maybe it's coming i think the

2398
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:11,840
deeper fundamental problem between us

2399
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,600
and the ants is that we don't have a

2400
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,760
common language it's not it's not the

2401
01:27:13,600 --> 01:27:17,199
interest it's that we don't even have a

2402
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:20,639
common language

2403
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:22,158
and so the the alien civilizations don't

2404
01:27:20,639 --> 01:27:23,279
even know how to communicate like we

2405
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:24,638
humans have

2406
01:27:23,279 --> 01:27:26,238
convinced ourselves we're special

2407
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,600
because we developed the language you

2408
01:27:26,238 --> 01:27:30,000
talked about you talk about the

2409
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:32,880
importance of language to intelligence

2410
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:34,479
but it makes you wonder like how very

2411
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,239
niche is that

2412
01:27:34,479 --> 01:27:38,718
like club that we've

2413
01:27:36,238 --> 01:27:40,879
like tried we've created of language and

2414
01:27:38,719 --> 01:27:42,399
linguistic type of systems that are very

2415
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,239
specific to our particular kinds of

2416
01:27:42,399 --> 01:27:45,839
brains and we share ideas together are

2417
01:27:44,238 --> 01:27:47,119
all super excited that we can understand

2418
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,760
the universe because we came up with

2419
01:27:47,119 --> 01:27:50,800
some notation yeah and math i wonder if

2420
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,480
there's some

2421
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:54,320
totally other kinds of language that

2422
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:56,718
communicates on a different time scale

2423
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:58,840
with different very different mechanisms

2424
01:27:56,719 --> 01:28:02,079
in a space of information that just is

2425
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:04,560
not it's everything everything is lost

2426
01:28:02,079 --> 01:28:06,880
in translation yeah and it could well be

2427
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:09,920
it's a look i mean i think part of the

2428
01:28:06,880 --> 01:28:12,800
reason i go toward the possibility

2429
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:15,119
of the soul intelligence

2430
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,320
is there's a certain kind of romantic

2431
01:28:15,119 --> 01:28:19,760
appeal

2432
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:22,399
to looking out in the cosmos and it's

2433
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,239
just quiet and it's just eternal silence

2434
01:28:22,399 --> 01:28:27,198
there's some there's something that

2435
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:30,559
appeals to me at an emotional level that

2436
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:34,079
way but yeah i mean um nobody

2437
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:35,520
nobody knows and uh it's certainly um

2438
01:28:34,079 --> 01:28:37,920
conceivable

2439
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,920
that we're there's just a radical

2440
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:41,440
mismatch between the kinds of things

2441
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:42,880
that we are able to observe and

2442
01:28:41,439 --> 01:28:45,678
sensitive to

2443
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:48,239
versus the kinds of structures that

2444
01:28:45,679 --> 01:28:50,800
permeate the universe in a manner that

2445
01:28:48,238 --> 01:28:52,559
simply we're unable to detect well if we

2446
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,960
are alone

2447
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:58,560
that is exciting in

2448
01:28:54,960 --> 01:29:00,719
one of the ways it's exciting is um

2449
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,719
that it's up to us to become to expand

2450
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,880
out into the universe

2451
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:07,600
to um permeate

2452
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,279
consciousness out into the universe

2453
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,600
so that's where space exploration comes

2454
01:29:09,279 --> 01:29:14,719
in let me ask you as somebody who's a

2455
01:29:11,600 --> 01:29:17,120
screen theorist a physicist

2456
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:20,000
do you think space exploration a

2457
01:29:17,119 --> 01:29:22,158
colonizing space is a physics or an

2458
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:24,000
engineering problem what would you say

2459
01:29:22,158 --> 01:29:26,399
yeah i think it's fundamentally an

2460
01:29:24,000 --> 01:29:28,158
engineering problem if

2461
01:29:26,399 --> 01:29:30,399
we're not trying to do

2462
01:29:28,158 --> 01:29:33,039
things like

2463
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:35,039
build wormholes the way they did say an

2464
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:37,439
interstellar to get to a different place

2465
01:29:35,039 --> 01:29:39,279
or trying to travel near the speed of

2466
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:41,039
light so that we would actually be able

2467
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:42,719
to traverse interstellar distances i

2468
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:45,519
mean without that

2469
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:47,119
our colonization will happen in a very

2470
01:29:45,520 --> 01:29:48,880
very slow

2471
01:29:47,119 --> 01:29:51,439
rate right um

2472
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:52,800
but one of the beauties of relativity is

2473
01:29:51,439 --> 01:29:55,839
if you do travel near the speed of light

2474
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,440
you you can actually go arbitrarily far

2475
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:59,520
in a human lifetime people say how's

2476
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:01,599
that possible you can't go billions of

2477
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,880
light years well you can actually

2478
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,120
because as you can do this bleed of

2479
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:07,440
light the way in which space and time

2480
01:30:05,119 --> 01:30:09,359
change allows you to go in principle

2481
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:12,000
arbitrarily far that's that's very

2482
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:13,439
exciting but if we put that physics side

2483
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,039
of the issue

2484
01:30:13,439 --> 01:30:16,719
in the manipulation space and time to

2485
01:30:15,039 --> 01:30:19,198
the side yeah i think it's a deep

2486
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:22,639
engineering problem you know how

2487
01:30:19,198 --> 01:30:24,238
do you terraform other planets i mean uh

2488
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:27,279
how do you

2489
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:29,279
go beyond our local neighborhood say

2490
01:30:27,279 --> 01:30:31,519
without you know using the ideas of

2491
01:30:29,279 --> 01:30:33,039
relativity so i think it's all quite

2492
01:30:31,520 --> 01:30:35,280
exciting and i think the idea is you

2493
01:30:33,039 --> 01:30:37,279
know using solar sails that you know

2494
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:39,759
people have developed and

2495
01:30:37,279 --> 01:30:42,319
uh you know trying to take that first

2496
01:30:39,760 --> 01:30:44,320
step to mars i think that's a vital and

2497
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:45,679
valuable step to take but yeah i think

2498
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:47,599
these are fundamentally engineering

2499
01:30:45,679 --> 01:30:51,359
challenges or extending the human

2500
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:53,679
lifespan through biology research or um

2501
01:30:51,359 --> 01:30:56,319
maybe reducing what it means to be a

2502
01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:58,158
human being into information and

2503
01:30:56,319 --> 01:31:00,719
uploading certain parts of it maybe not

2504
01:30:58,158 --> 01:31:02,960
all the full resolution of a human life

2505
01:31:00,719 --> 01:31:04,880
but maybe the essential things

2506
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:07,600
like the dna and be able to reconstruct

2507
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:07,600
that human being

2508
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:11,440
but

2509
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:12,399
you know i have to ask about mars

2510
01:31:11,439 --> 01:31:14,000
you know

2511
01:31:12,399 --> 01:31:14,799
do you find

2512
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,439
the

2513
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:20,079
the dream of humans stepping on mars

2514
01:31:17,439 --> 01:31:21,439
stepping foot first but also colonizing

2515
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:22,559
mars

2516
01:31:21,439 --> 01:31:25,119
um

2517
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,960
one that's worth us fighting for yeah

2518
01:31:25,119 --> 01:31:27,920
usually so i mean i think what we have

2519
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:30,800
long

2520
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:33,840
been not always in the best way

2521
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:36,400
is a species of explorers

2522
01:31:33,840 --> 01:31:37,760
in the literal sense of

2523
01:31:36,399 --> 01:31:39,679
traveling from

2524
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:42,320
one part of the world to another or in

2525
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:44,560
the more metaphorical sense of trying to

2526
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:46,399
travel through our minds to the quantum

2527
01:31:44,560 --> 01:31:48,719
realm or back to the big bang or to the

2528
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:50,799
center of black holes so i think that's

2529
01:31:48,719 --> 01:31:54,800
fundamentally part of of the human

2530
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:55,679
spirit so i do think that's a vital part

2531
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:59,279
of

2532
01:31:55,679 --> 01:32:03,600
our heritage brought forward into its

2533
01:31:59,279 --> 01:32:05,920
next incarnation that's who we are

2534
01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:08,320
do you think there'll be a day

2535
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:11,119
in the future where

2536
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:12,639
a human being is born on mars

2537
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:15,840
and has to

2538
01:32:12,639 --> 01:32:18,000
learn about his or her

2539
01:32:15,840 --> 01:32:20,159
human origins on earth like they'll have

2540
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,279
to read in the book

2541
01:32:20,158 --> 01:32:22,479
yeah i don't think it'll be a book at

2542
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:24,639
that stage it'll probably just be

2543
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:26,799
uploaded into the head or something or

2544
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:28,880
you know imprinted into the dna and then

2545
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:31,440
they just sort of sense it but yeah i

2546
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:33,760
think there's there's well look the the

2547
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:36,000
issue you raised before is the vital one

2548
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:38,800
is it the case that any sufficiently

2549
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:41,198
advanced civilization destroys itself

2550
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:42,800
is that sort of a a commonplace quality

2551
01:32:41,198 --> 01:32:45,279
i mean that's the other potential answer

2552
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:47,440
to the fermi paradox uh why aren't they

2553
01:32:45,279 --> 01:32:48,800
here because by the time they got to the

2554
01:32:47,439 --> 01:32:50,319
technological development where they

2555
01:32:48,800 --> 01:32:52,239
could travel here they blew themselves

2556
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:54,880
up they destroyed themselves and that's

2557
01:32:52,238 --> 01:32:55,839
a you know you know an unfortunate but

2558
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,960
you know

2559
01:32:55,840 --> 01:33:01,119
not a hard to imagine possibility based

2560
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:03,760
on things that have happened here

2561
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:06,079
on planet earth but but putting that to

2562
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:07,679
the side i think it um you know that's

2563
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:10,000
the big obstacle but putting it to the

2564
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:12,239
side we will resolve the engineering

2565
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:14,800
challenges and and you know i should

2566
01:33:12,238 --> 01:33:16,158
probably um modify my answer from before

2567
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:19,199
when you said is it engineering or

2568
01:33:16,158 --> 01:33:21,439
physics it's really both right so so we

2569
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:23,039
will surmount the engineering challenges

2570
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:25,119
and that will then make the physics

2571
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:26,719
challenges relevant it'll make it

2572
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:28,319
relevant to figure out how to travel

2573
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,560
near the speed of light it'll make it

2574
01:33:28,319 --> 01:33:34,000
relevant to learn how to manipulate the

2575
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:36,719
shape of space-time and so forth so

2576
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:38,719
so i think it's a multi-stage process

2577
01:33:36,719 --> 01:33:40,639
where it is engineering and ultimately

2578
01:33:38,719 --> 01:33:42,560
physics and if we stick around long

2579
01:33:40,639 --> 01:33:43,760
enough those are the kinds of challenges

2580
01:33:42,560 --> 01:33:45,840
i think that we're ultimately going to

2581
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:47,520
surmount and then the physics side is

2582
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:49,039
figuring out how to harness energy

2583
01:33:47,520 --> 01:33:51,120
enough to travel outside the solar

2584
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:54,000
system which seems like a heck of a

2585
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:55,599
difficult journey but even mars itself

2586
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,439
of um

2587
01:33:55,600 --> 01:34:00,400
i don't know maybe because i i was born

2588
01:33:57,439 --> 01:34:03,039
in the soviet union and was

2589
01:34:00,399 --> 01:34:04,879
born with the

2590
01:34:03,039 --> 01:34:07,198
you know looking up at the stars and

2591
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:09,359
that dream of like the highest of human

2592
01:34:07,198 --> 01:34:11,919
achievement his ability to fly out there

2593
01:34:09,359 --> 01:34:13,759
to you know to join the stars

2594
01:34:11,920 --> 01:34:16,079
i i really like the idea of going to

2595
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:19,520
mars of and not just stepping foot on

2596
01:34:16,079 --> 01:34:21,519
mars and it wasn't until

2597
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:24,239
maybe um

2598
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:26,880
misinformed but for me personally

2599
01:34:24,238 --> 01:34:28,479
uh it wasn't until elon musk

2600
01:34:26,880 --> 01:34:29,760
started talking about the colonization

2601
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:32,479
of mars

2602
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:35,360
did i realize like

2603
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:37,439
we humans can actually do that

2604
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:40,639
and the first of all the importance

2605
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:42,799
of somebody saying that we can do these

2606
01:34:40,639 --> 01:34:46,400
seemingly impossible things

2607
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:49,039
is um immeasurable because uh you know

2608
01:34:46,399 --> 01:34:50,000
the fact that he he placed that into my

2609
01:34:49,039 --> 01:34:52,000
mind

2610
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:53,439
and into the minds of millions of others

2611
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:56,158
maybe hundreds of millions maybe

2612
01:34:53,439 --> 01:34:57,678
billions of others young kids today i

2613
01:34:56,158 --> 01:35:00,000
mean that that's going to make it a

2614
01:34:57,679 --> 01:35:01,760
reality i for some reason i'm deeply

2615
01:35:00,000 --> 01:35:04,158
excited

2616
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:06,880
even though my work isn't ai

2617
01:35:04,158 --> 01:35:09,359
that echoes all of this i'm excited by

2618
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:12,079
the idea that somebody would be born

2619
01:35:09,359 --> 01:35:14,880
as we were saying on mars

2620
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:17,198
and sort of look up and be able to see

2621
01:35:14,880 --> 01:35:19,199
with the telescope earth and say that's

2622
01:35:17,198 --> 01:35:20,638
where i came from

2623
01:35:19,198 --> 01:35:23,599
i don't know that

2624
01:35:20,639 --> 01:35:26,000
that idea scale to other planets to

2625
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:28,480
other solar systems yeah that's really

2626
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:30,238
exciting hugely exciting i i think

2627
01:35:28,479 --> 01:35:32,079
you're absolutely right i mean the vital

2628
01:35:30,238 --> 01:35:33,359
thing

2629
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:34,880
is to dream

2630
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:37,599
right i mean

2631
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:38,800
and it sound hackney but it is so

2632
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:40,719
important

2633
01:35:38,800 --> 01:35:43,520
for for young kids for the next

2634
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:45,520
generation to to think about the things

2635
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,520
that are seemingly impossible i mean

2636
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:50,159
that's what makes them possible and this

2637
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:51,199
is one which is concrete enough

2638
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:53,439
i mean this is something that's going to

2639
01:35:51,198 --> 01:35:54,719
happen soon in terms of actually going

2640
01:35:53,439 --> 01:35:58,319
to mars

2641
01:35:54,719 --> 01:35:59,198
and then the next step of establishing

2642
01:35:58,319 --> 01:36:01,599
some

2643
01:35:59,198 --> 01:36:03,839
presence some semi-permanent or

2644
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:06,000
permanent presence this is this is not

2645
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,199
something that's gonna wait to the 25th

2646
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:09,118
century i mean this is something that's

2647
01:36:07,198 --> 01:36:10,638
going to happen relatively soon

2648
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:12,719
so i mean it could well be in your

2649
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:15,359
lifetime unlikely mind but possibly in

2650
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:17,279
your lifetime that that kid will be born

2651
01:36:15,359 --> 01:36:19,039
and and and have the experience that

2652
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:21,439
that you describe so yeah it's

2653
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:23,679
spectacularly exciting

2654
01:36:21,439 --> 01:36:25,759
and i actually i would love to go on

2655
01:36:23,679 --> 01:36:27,840
mars and one of the early

2656
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:30,800
you would yeah what if it's one way i

2657
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:32,319
was i'm happy really wow yeah and i'm

2658
01:36:30,800 --> 01:36:34,400
i'm single if there's ladies out there

2659
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:37,039
that want to start that family

2660
01:36:34,399 --> 01:36:38,559
let's go let's go out to mars no i think

2661
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:40,319
uh see i have to tell you something you

2662
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:42,560
spoke about terror

2663
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:45,279
thinking about like black holes

2664
01:36:42,560 --> 01:36:47,119
if i actually think about going to mars

2665
01:36:45,279 --> 01:36:49,599
and being on mars

2666
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:51,599
and put myself in there fully

2667
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,440
that's terror inducing

2668
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:55,520
the idea of to be

2669
01:36:53,439 --> 01:36:58,479
in this foreign world where you can't

2670
01:36:55,520 --> 01:37:00,239
come back where you've made this this

2671
01:36:58,479 --> 01:37:02,238
choice that can't be reversed or you

2672
01:37:00,238 --> 01:37:03,599
know at some point it may be but but in

2673
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:06,479
that guys

2674
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:08,320
that to me carries a deep sense of

2675
01:37:06,479 --> 01:37:10,079
terror hmm

2676
01:37:08,319 --> 01:37:11,920
you know i i feel that sense of terror

2677
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:14,319
every time kerouac jack carrack talked

2678
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:16,639
about this and on the road is you know

2679
01:37:14,319 --> 01:37:18,399
when you leave a place if you're honest

2680
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:20,480
about it

2681
01:37:18,399 --> 01:37:22,238
like life is short

2682
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:23,919
and when you leave a place you move to a

2683
01:37:22,238 --> 01:37:25,599
new place and you think of all the

2684
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,960
friends maybe family you're leaving

2685
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:31,280
behind as you drive over the hill

2686
01:37:28,960 --> 01:37:32,960
that that really is goodbye

2687
01:37:31,279 --> 01:37:35,118
like we sometimes don't think of it that

2688
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:36,880
way when we're moving but that really is

2689
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:39,519
goodbye to that life to the person you

2690
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:41,279
were to all the people maybe if it's

2691
01:37:39,520 --> 01:37:43,360
close friends you'll see them maybe 10

2692
01:37:41,279 --> 01:37:45,439
15 more times in your life and that's it

2693
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:48,880
yeah and you're saying goodbye to all of

2694
01:37:45,439 --> 01:37:51,118
that and so in the same way i i see it

2695
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:52,800
as way more dramatic when you're flying

2696
01:37:51,118 --> 01:37:54,000
away from earth and it's like it's

2697
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:57,199
goodbye

2698
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:58,800
to dunkin donuts and starbucks and

2699
01:37:57,198 --> 01:38:00,638
it's goodbye to whatever i don't know

2700
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:03,840
why i picked those but some all the

2701
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:07,199
things that are special to earth

2702
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:08,159
it's goodbye but that's that's life i i

2703
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:10,559
suppose

2704
01:38:08,158 --> 01:38:11,599
more what excites me about that kind of

2705
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:14,000
journey

2706
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:16,480
is it's a distinct contemplation of your

2707
01:38:14,000 --> 01:38:18,399
mortality acceptance of your mortality

2708
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:20,319
you're saying

2709
01:38:18,399 --> 01:38:22,719
just like when you take on any difficult

2710
01:38:20,319 --> 01:38:25,118
journey it's accepting

2711
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:27,198
that you're going to die one day

2712
01:38:25,118 --> 01:38:29,279
and might as well do

2713
01:38:27,198 --> 01:38:31,439
something truly exciting yes i mean i

2714
01:38:29,279 --> 01:38:32,479
will you know i'm with you on that i uh

2715
01:38:31,439 --> 01:38:34,638
i'm a

2716
01:38:32,479 --> 01:38:38,000
strong believer that

2717
01:38:34,639 --> 01:38:40,880
deep underneath human motivation is

2718
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:42,479
this this terror of our own mortality

2719
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:43,920
you know there's this wonderful book

2720
01:38:42,479 --> 01:38:45,759
that had a great influence in me called

2721
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:47,520
the denial of death

2722
01:38:45,760 --> 01:38:48,719
by ernest becker

2723
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:49,920
and

2724
01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:51,359
when you

2725
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:53,359
are aware

2726
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:56,158
of the ways in which

2727
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:59,679
our mortality influences our behaviors

2728
01:38:56,158 --> 01:39:01,198
it really does add a different slant a

2729
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:03,520
different kind of color to the

2730
01:39:01,198 --> 01:39:06,719
interpretation of human behavior

2731
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:08,560
yeah it's funny um that that book had a

2732
01:39:06,719 --> 01:39:10,319
big influence on me as well is that

2733
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,639
right right

2734
01:39:10,319 --> 01:39:13,679
and terror management theory and and

2735
01:39:12,639 --> 01:39:15,840
i

2736
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:17,279
again from an engineering perspective i

2737
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:19,520
don't know how many people that book

2738
01:39:17,279 --> 01:39:21,599
influenced

2739
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:24,000
because i talk to people about the fear

2740
01:39:21,600 --> 01:39:26,480
of death and it doesn't seem to be

2741
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:28,158
that fundamental to their experience

2742
01:39:26,479 --> 01:39:29,678
and i don't think on the surface is

2743
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:31,198
fundamental to my experience but it

2744
01:39:29,679 --> 01:39:33,279
seems like an awfully in terms of we

2745
01:39:31,198 --> 01:39:35,919
talk about models and strength theory

2746
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:38,559
and theories in terms of theories of

2747
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:40,880
this macro experience of human life it

2748
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,880
seems like a heck of a good theory

2749
01:39:40,880 --> 01:39:45,520
that the fear of death is that the kind

2750
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:47,279
of is the warm at the core yeah well i

2751
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,600
mean and the terror management theories

2752
01:39:47,279 --> 01:39:50,319
that you make reference to i mean

2753
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:51,760
the

2754
01:39:50,319 --> 01:39:53,679
this is a group of you know

2755
01:39:51,760 --> 01:39:55,520
psychologists social psychologists who

2756
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:57,840
devise these very

2757
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:59,600
clever experiments real world

2758
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:02,239
experiments with real people

2759
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:04,000
where you can directly measure the

2760
01:40:02,238 --> 01:40:06,718
hidden influence

2761
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,920
of the recognition of our own

2762
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:09,520
mortality i mean they've done these

2763
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:11,440
experiments where they have group of

2764
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,560
people a group of people b

2765
01:40:11,439 --> 01:40:14,559
and the only difference between the two

2766
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:17,119
groups is that group b they somehow

2767
01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:18,560
reminded them in some subtle way of

2768
01:40:17,118 --> 01:40:21,118
their own mortality sometimes it's

2769
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:23,520
nothing more than interviewing them

2770
01:40:21,118 --> 01:40:25,198
with a funeral home across the street

2771
01:40:23,520 --> 01:40:26,400
you know an influence is there but it's

2772
01:40:25,198 --> 01:40:28,559
but it's subtle you don't even think you

2773
01:40:26,399 --> 01:40:29,920
take note of and they can find

2774
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:31,119
measurable

2775
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:33,920
effects

2776
01:40:31,118 --> 01:40:36,238
that differentiate the two groups to a

2777
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:38,239
high degree of statistical significance

2778
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:40,718
and how they respond to certain

2779
01:40:38,238 --> 01:40:43,359
challenges or certain kinds of questions

2780
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:44,639
that shows a direct influence of the

2781
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:47,198
reminder

2782
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:50,159
of their own mortality and i've read a

2783
01:40:47,198 --> 01:40:52,799
number of these studies and they are

2784
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:55,039
really convincing and so yeah i would

2785
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:56,400
say that the reason why so many people

2786
01:40:55,039 --> 01:40:58,639
would say that

2787
01:40:56,399 --> 01:41:01,039
yeah fear of mortality it's not front

2788
01:40:58,639 --> 01:41:02,319
and center in my world view

2789
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:03,359
yeah i don't really think about it much

2790
01:41:02,319 --> 01:41:05,198
doesn't really matter too much the

2791
01:41:03,359 --> 01:41:07,359
reason why they're able to say that is

2792
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:09,359
because this thing called culture

2793
01:41:07,359 --> 01:41:12,000
has emerged over the course of the last

2794
01:41:09,359 --> 01:41:14,719
10 000 years and part of the role of

2795
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:16,719
culture is to give us a means of not

2796
01:41:14,719 --> 01:41:18,639
thinking about our mortality all the

2797
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:21,840
time of not living in terror of the

2798
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:23,520
inevitable end which faces us all so

2799
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:25,600
it's completely understandable that

2800
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:28,239
that's the response because that's what

2801
01:41:25,600 --> 01:41:30,159
culture is at least in part four it's at

2802
01:41:28,238 --> 01:41:33,439
least possible

2803
01:41:30,158 --> 01:41:36,238
that uh the fear of death the terror of

2804
01:41:33,439 --> 01:41:38,960
your mortality is the creative force

2805
01:41:36,238 --> 01:41:41,439
that created all of the things around us

2806
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:43,359
at this human civilization

2807
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:45,279
and i think about from an engineering

2808
01:41:43,359 --> 01:41:48,158
perspective

2809
01:41:45,279 --> 01:41:50,800
this is where i lose all of my robotics

2810
01:41:48,158 --> 01:41:52,719
colleagues is i feel like

2811
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,480
if you want to create intelligence you

2812
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:57,520
have to also

2813
01:41:54,479 --> 01:42:00,799
engineer in some kind of

2814
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:03,040
echoes of this kind of fear of uh and

2815
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,239
not you know fear is such a complicated

2816
01:42:03,039 --> 01:42:06,719
word but

2817
01:42:04,238 --> 01:42:09,118
it's kind of like a scarcity

2818
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:10,480
a scarcity of time a scarcity of

2819
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:12,839
resources

2820
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:15,678
that creates a kind of anxiety like

2821
01:42:12,840 --> 01:42:18,159
deadlines get you to do stuff yeah and

2822
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:20,158
there's something almost fundamental to

2823
01:42:18,158 --> 01:42:21,920
that in terms of uh

2824
01:42:20,158 --> 01:42:24,079
human experience yeah well that's an

2825
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:26,239
interesting thought so you're basically

2826
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:27,679
in order to

2827
01:42:26,238 --> 01:42:30,079
create

2828
01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:33,118
a kind of

2829
01:42:30,079 --> 01:42:35,359
structure that mirrors what we call

2830
01:42:33,118 --> 01:42:36,960
consciousness yes you'd better have that

2831
01:42:35,359 --> 01:42:40,000
structure

2832
01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:41,118
confront the same kinds of issues and

2833
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,279
terrorism

2834
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:45,519
that we do consciousness and suffering

2835
01:42:43,279 --> 01:42:48,000
only makes sense in the context of death

2836
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,639
if you want to i feel like

2837
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,719
if you want to fit into human society

2838
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:56,159
if you if you're a robot if you want to

2839
01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:59,039
fit into human society you better have

2840
01:42:56,158 --> 01:43:00,638
the same kind of existential dread

2841
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:02,800
the same kind of fear of mortality

2842
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:06,079
otherwise you're not going to fit in

2843
01:43:02,800 --> 01:43:08,719
[Laughter]

2844
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:10,800
it might be it might be wild but it's at

2845
01:43:08,719 --> 01:43:12,079
least like we're talking about all the

2846
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:13,920
theories that

2847
01:43:12,079 --> 01:43:16,079
are at least worth consideration i think

2848
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:19,440
that's a really powerful one and

2849
01:43:16,079 --> 01:43:21,279
definitely one has uh resonated with me

2850
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:25,599
and um

2851
01:43:21,279 --> 01:43:28,000
definitely seems to capture something

2852
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:31,199
beautifully

2853
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:34,719
like real about the human condition

2854
01:43:31,198 --> 01:43:36,719
and i i wonder it's of course sucks to

2855
01:43:34,719 --> 01:43:39,840
think that we need death

2856
01:43:36,719 --> 01:43:39,840
to appreciate life

2857
01:43:40,238 --> 01:43:43,279
but

2858
01:43:41,279 --> 01:43:44,559
that just may be the way it is well it's

2859
01:43:43,279 --> 01:43:48,158
interesting if this robotic or

2860
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:50,159
artificially intelligent system

2861
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:51,759
understands the world and understands

2862
01:43:50,158 --> 01:43:53,359
the second law of thermodynamics and

2863
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:54,880
entropy

2864
01:43:53,359 --> 01:43:56,319
even in artificial intelligence will

2865
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:59,118
realize that

2866
01:43:56,319 --> 01:44:01,279
even if its parts are really robust

2867
01:43:59,118 --> 01:44:03,359
ultimately it will

2868
01:44:01,279 --> 01:44:05,519
disintegrate yeah i mean so the time

2869
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:06,880
scales may be different but in a way

2870
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:09,360
when you think about it doesn't matter

2871
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:11,760
once you know that you are mortal in the

2872
01:44:09,359 --> 01:44:13,599
sense that you are not eternal the time

2873
01:44:11,760 --> 01:44:14,800
scale hardly matters

2874
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,760
because

2875
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:19,920
it's it's either the whole thing or not

2876
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:22,000
because on the scales of eternity any

2877
01:44:19,920 --> 01:44:23,600
finite duration however large is

2878
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,399
effectively zero

2879
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:28,320
on the scales of eternity and so maybe

2880
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:31,920
it won't be so hard for an artificial

2881
01:44:28,319 --> 01:44:34,319
system to feel that sense of mortality

2882
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:37,118
because it will recognize the underlying

2883
01:44:34,319 --> 01:44:38,559
physical laws and recognize its own

2884
01:44:37,118 --> 01:44:40,799
finitude

2885
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:43,280
and then it'll be us and robots drinking

2886
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:45,600
beers looking up at the stars and just

2887
01:44:43,279 --> 01:44:45,599
uh

2888
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:50,239
you

2889
01:44:46,840 --> 01:44:52,960
know uh having a good laugh in awe of

2890
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:55,198
the whole thing yeah

2891
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:57,439
i think that's a pretty good way to end

2892
01:44:55,198 --> 01:44:58,319
it talking about the fear of death we

2893
01:44:57,439 --> 01:44:59,839
started

2894
01:44:58,319 --> 01:45:01,359
talking about the meaning of life and

2895
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:03,119
ended on the fear of death brian it's

2896
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:04,079
just an incredible conversation pleasure

2897
01:45:03,118 --> 01:45:05,759
thank you

2898
01:45:04,079 --> 01:45:07,600
i really really enjoyed it it's been a

2899
01:45:05,760 --> 01:45:09,760
long time coming i'm a huge fan of your

2900
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:11,920
work a huge fan of your writing thanks

2901
01:45:09,760 --> 01:45:12,880
for talking about thank you

2902
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:15,118
thanks for listening to this

2903
01:45:12,880 --> 01:45:16,639
conversation with brian green to support

2904
01:45:15,118 --> 01:45:18,799
this podcast please check out our

2905
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:20,800
sponsors in the description

2906
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:22,960
and now let me leave you with some words

2907
01:45:20,800 --> 01:45:25,760
from bill bryson

2908
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:28,239
physics is really nothing more than a

2909
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:31,360
search for ultimate simplicity but so

2910
01:45:28,238 --> 01:45:32,959
far all we have is a kind of elegant

2911
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:34,639
messiness

2912
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:38,279
thank you for listening and hope to see

2913
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:38,279
you next time

2914
01:45:44,399 --> 01:45:46,479
you
