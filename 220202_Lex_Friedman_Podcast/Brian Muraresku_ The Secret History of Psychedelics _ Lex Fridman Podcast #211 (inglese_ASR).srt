5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,879
the forgotten history of psychedelics in

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,960

in the description

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,480
this is the lex friedman podcast and

14
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,280
here's my conversation

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,759
with brian murescu

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,520
who or what do you think

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,439
god is

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,000
how is our conception maybe put another

19
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:43,879
way of god changed throughout history

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,719
we're starting with an easy one lex yep

21
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:48,879
[Laughter]

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,640
so what is god well god

23
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,399
is a thought

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,960
god is an idea

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,520
but it's its reference is to that which

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,198
is beyond thinking beyond our ability to

27
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:02,320
even conceive

28
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:04,478
um beyond the categories of being and

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,079
non-being so how do we talk about that

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,039
to talk about it is almost to get it

31
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:09,118
wrong

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,760
right so uh joe campbell famously said

33
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,159
that you know any god that is not

34
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,478
transparent to transcendence is like an

35
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,759
idolatry because it's just a mental

36
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:19,519
construct

37
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,200
and it can't possibly speak to the

38
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,560
incomprehensible so we use poetic

39
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,880
language we say

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,478
the being of beings the um

41
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:28,798
the infinite

42
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:31,840
life energy of the universe the the

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,799
mystery of transcendence boundless life

44
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,439
unqualified is-ness but it doesn't quite

45
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,240
get to the point i think that if there's

46
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:44,000
any great insight from mysticism it's

47
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:46,078
that you and i participate with god

48
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,879
in a very real way lex friedman here in

49
00:01:46,078 --> 00:01:50,959
austin texas that in the here and now to

50
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:53,280
touch that eternal principle another way

51
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:55,919
to refer to god to touch that eternal

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,879
principle within ourselves

53
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,240
is to participate with with divinity in

54
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,399
some way um so not an external force but

55
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,959
that divine sense within so there's some

56
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,479
aspect in which god is a part of us so

57
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:10,239
one it's the thing we can't describe

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,280
this represents all of the mystery

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,039
around us

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,039
it's outside our

61
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,639
ability to comprehend and at the same

62
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,079
time it's somehow the thing that's

63
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:20,878
inside of us

64
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,120
also the ultimate paradox mcfield of

65
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:25,840
magdeburg 13th century german mystic

66
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,000
maybe the first german mystic um

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,719
says that the the day of her spiritual

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,439
awakening was the day that she saw and

69
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,759
knew that she saw god in all things and

70
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:37,919
all things in god and so we can say this

71
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:40,239
by the way without apology or

72
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,119
lightweight theology or

73
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,120
vapit speculation or even heresy you

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,800
know we can we can talk about this

75
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,560
including within the abrahamic faiths

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,599
the mystical core of these faiths all

77
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,519
talk about the encounter of divinity

78
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:57,280
within that's what i explore in the

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,480
immortality key that this notion of

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,479
techniques

81
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:03,119
archaic techniques in some cases of

82
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,039
ecstasy that allow that experience of

83
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,719
the eternal principle to actually rise

84
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,479
up in our consciousness

85
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:09,759
when we're still here as flesh and blood

86
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,840
beings

87
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:15,120
there's some sense in which our

88
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,200
conception of god though

89
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,239
is conjured up by our own mind

90
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,518
and so

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,200
aren't we

92
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,680
creating god

93
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:27,919
like aren't we the gods

94
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,680
that are creating the idea of god

95
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:31,359
like if if we are

96
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,799
like when we talk about

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,400
god

98
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,519
aren't we playing with ideas that are

99
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,799
created by our

100
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,000
our mind and thereby

101
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,760
we are the creator not god

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,959
this is a very kind of

103
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:47,840
cyclical question but in some sense i

104
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,598
mean

105
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,920
that uh

106
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:54,719
if god is the thing that represents

107
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:57,598
the mystery all around us

108
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:59,680
contrast that with our conception of god

109
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,919
the way we talk about him is more a

110
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,360
creation of our minds it's not the

111
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,919
mystery it's our

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,840
uh struggle to comprehend the mystery

113
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:09,518
and therefore we're creating the god in

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,319
terms of the god that we we're talking

115
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,158
about in this conversation or in general

116
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:16,878
if that makes any sense it makes no

117
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:16,879
sense whatsoever

118
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:22,399
but this is this is uh this is the

119
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:24,399
eternal mystery um

120
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,159
this is why it's so difficult to talk

121
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:29,439
about and yet it could be the very

122
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,280
center of our beings

123
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,079
you know the upanishads

124
00:04:31,279 --> 00:04:35,679
speak about us as the creators about us

125
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,639
as gods it's a very different creation

126
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,959
myth but the god of the upanishads

127
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,478
in this great verse talks about

128
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,039
pouring themselves

129
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:48,079
pouring themselves into creation indeed

130
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,879
i have become this creation says god and

131
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:54,240
there's a great line verily he or she

132
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,680
who knows this becomes in this creation

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,720
a creator

134
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,600
so

135
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:02,320
yeah i mean just our ability to engage

136
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,240
in mentation our ability to to think

137
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,680
about this stuff is partly our divine

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,680
nature this is what the humanists were

139
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,038
talking about and in the renaissance by

140
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:14,400
the way um and that it's not so much

141
00:05:11,038 --> 00:05:16,719
learning putting dots together having

142
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:19,679
arguments with each other over learned

143
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,120
books it's it's a process of unlearning

144
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,478
is what some of the mystical traditions

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,038
talk about

146
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,199
unlearning all these thoughts emotions

147
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,360
traumas and experiences that have gone

148
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,759
into the false construction of our false

149
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,759
self that behind all these layers like

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,759
peeling back the onion

151
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,800
is a part of us

152
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,800
that once you can identify that

153
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,520
um begins to look a little bit different

154
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,240
in other words it's one thing to

155
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:50,079
foster a relationship with god it's a

156
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,600
very different thing to identify as god

157
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,680
and and i mean that quite literally

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,560
without being heretical you can you can

159
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,560
find this in the mystery traditions

160
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,720
can you expand on this you mean a human

161
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,439
being can

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,639
can embody god

163
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:09,519
that is um textbook incarnational

164
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:12,478
theology that you can find in any any

165
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:14,959
christian mystic um but you can find it

166
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:18,800
in the mystical tradition of islam and

167
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:21,279
and judaism as well so rumi for example

168
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,680
the great uh the great sufi mystic talks

169
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:25,599
about um if you could

170
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,400
get rid of yourself just get rid of

171
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,560
yourself just once the secret of secrets

172
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:33,439
would open to you that the face of the

173
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,199
unknown would appear on the perception

174
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,199
of your consciousness

175
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,800
rabbi lawrence kushner a modern-day

176
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,560
contemporary mystic

177
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
talks about uh because this stuff does

178
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,360
continue there's a continuity the poetry

179
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,600
here is incredible so well listen listen

180
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,080
to rabbi kushner he says that the

181
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,639
emptying of selfhood

182
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,758
allows the soul to attach to true

183
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:58,160
reality and in kabulism the true reality

184
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,840
is what's called the divine nothingness

185
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,160
i yin and so i like the adage that um

186
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:05,119
and mystics both essentially believe in

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,199
nothing

188
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,560
except that the mystics spell it with a

189
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,560
capital n

190
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,800
the divine nothing yeah and then i'll

191
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,280
give you meister eckhart

192
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
another medieval christian mystic he

193
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:19,038
says that

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,439
if you could not yourself right the same

195
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:23,839
concept if you could not yourself for

196
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:26,160
just an instant indeed i say less than

197
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,000
an instant you would possess all so

198
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,039
again you're seeing the same thing in

199
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,279
sufism

200
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:33,839
kabbalism christian mysticism the way to

201
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,719
identify with the divine is to peel back

202
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,079
these layers and attempt to discover

203
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,599
pure awareness

204
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:41,598
if we look at the universe from a

205
00:07:39,598 --> 00:07:44,560
physics perspective or you know i'm a

206
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,918
computer science person so if the

207
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,079
universe is a

208
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,560
is a computer

209
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,240
there's some sense that

210
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,720
god

211
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,319
the creator of the universe or just the

212
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,759
computer itself

213
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,639
doesn't know what the heck is going to

214
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,720
happen

215
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,478
it just kind of creates some basic rules

216
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,520
and runs the thing

217
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,918
so there is some element in which

218
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:09,918
you can conceive of humans or conscious

219
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,120
beings or intelligent beings

220
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:12,639
as uh

221
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,199
as a tool

222
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,840
that the creator uses to understand

223
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,800
itself himself

224
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,359
do you uh do you think that's

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,079
a perspective that uh we could or is

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,840
useful to take on god that

227
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,758
is basically

228
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,758
the universe created humans to

229
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,240
understand itself

230
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,800
he doesn't actually know the full thing

231
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,360
he needs the human brains to figure out

232
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,359
the puzzle so that's in contrasting to

233
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,599
the unlearning to getting out of the way

234
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,440
that we've talked about it's more like

235
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,240
no we need the humans to figure out this

236
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,240
puzzle well we have no answers to this

237
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,240
which is why philosophers still have

238
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,919
jobs if they have jobs at all but i mean

239
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,320
they're so the physicists take a look at

240
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:57,838
this um have you seen the article that

241
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,278
came out i think it was this month in

242
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,080
the journal of cosmology and

243
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:04,480
astroparticle physics um uh robert lanza

244
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,560
the biocentrism theory the idea that the

245
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,480
universe comes into being through our

246
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,479
observation right the whole the god

247
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,639
equation so not just in quantum

248
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,879
mechanics but in general relativity the

249
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,720
idea that that we make the universe

250
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,639
moment by moment which is kind of

251
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,080
mind-blowing gets into ideas of

252
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:21,679
simulation

253
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,200
okay so that's how the physicists at

254
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:25,199
least some of them might look at it you

255
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,640
could also look back to the medieval

256
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,360
christian mystics

257
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:33,278
meister eckhart once again says that the

258
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,480
i with which i see god is the same eye

259
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:37,838
that sees me right so one sight

260
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
one knowledge

261
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,440
one love um

262
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,440
another mind-blowing concept but this is

263
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,120
this is why the arts and poetry and

264
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,279
music are so important because although

265
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,440
i love astroparticle physics

266
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,399
it's another to kind of hear this

267
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,560
the same message um across time

268
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,879
yeah the simulation thing

269
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:59,199
i was actually looking this morning at

270
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:02,159
video games just the statistics on video

271
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,640
games and i saw that the two top video

272
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,679
games in terms of hours played

273
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:11,919
is fortnite and world of warcraft and i

274
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,599
saw that it's 140 billion hours

275
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:16,000
billion hours have been played at those

276
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
games

277
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:21,360
that's a lot of video games

278
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,879
yeah but that that's very sophisticated

279
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,079
worlds being created especially in the

280
00:10:22,879 --> 00:10:27,679
world of warcraft it's a massive online

281
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:30,000
role-playing game so you have these

282
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:32,078
characters that are together sort of

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,078
creating a world but they in themselves

284
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,359
they're also developing they have all

285
00:10:34,078 --> 00:10:37,278
these items and they're growing like

286
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,879
they're little humans like there's

287
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:40,320
complicated societies that are formed

288
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:41,120
they have goals they're striving and so

289
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,040
on

290
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,120
and it's we're creating a universe

291
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,278
within our universe and for now it's a

292
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,078
kind of um

293
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,320
it's a basic sort of constrained version

294
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:55,759
of our more richer earth like

295
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,360
civilization but it's conceivable that

296
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,078
you know that

297
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,079
we are this thing on earth is a kind of

298
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,599
video game that somebody else is playing

299
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,559
it's like you could see sort of video

300
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,440
games upon video games being created

301
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,199
that uh and this is something i think a

302
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,079
lot about not from a philosophical

303
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:16,240
perspective but practically how fun does

304
00:11:14,078 --> 00:11:18,479
this video game have to be

305
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,879
for us to let go of the

306
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,440
silly pursuits in this meet space that

307
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,360
we live in and fully

308
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:28,560
just stay in wow stay in world of

309
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,240
warcraft stay in the video game for full

310
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,919
time so i think about that from an

311
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,600
engineering perspective like is there

312
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:38,799
going to be a time when this video game

313
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,200
is actual real life for us and then the

314
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,958
creatures inside the video game

315
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,240
they'll be just borrowing our

316
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:46,879
consciousness

317
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,680
for sort of to ground themselves will

318
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:53,679
refer to us as the gods

319
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,679
right like won't we become the gods

320
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,320
this conversation is not going how i

321
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,319
expected but i think about this a lot

322
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
from you know because i love video games

323
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,519
and i wonder

324
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:05,360
more and more of us especially in covet

325
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,639
times of living in the digital world you

326
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,560
could think about twitter and all those

327
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,560
kinds of things you could think about

328
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:12,958
clubhouse people using just voices to

329
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,799
communicate with little icons sort of in

330
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:16,879
the digital space you can see more and

331
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:19,519
more will be moving in the digital space

332
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:22,559
and let go of this physical space

333
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,720
and then the the remnants

334
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,119
of the the ancients that created the

335
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,200
video games that nobody

336
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,039
centuries from now will even remember

337
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
those will be the gods and then there'll

338
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,120
be gods upon gods being created

339
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:38,399
this is the kind of stuff i think about

340
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,240
but is that any at all useful to you

341
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,720
to this thought experiment of a

342
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,959
simulation basically the fabric of our

343
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,440
reality how did it come to be what is

344
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,879
running this thing is that useful or is

345
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,440
it ultimately

346
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:53,600
the project of understanding god

347
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,480
of understanding myth

348
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,240
is the project that centers on the human

349
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,240
on the human mind for you

350
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,000
we seem to be at the center of this

351
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:05,439
divine dance which which sounds awfully

352
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,480
anthropocentric

353
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,240
but

354
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,879
the ancients thought about this too i

355
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,959
mean the concept and sanskrit of lila

356
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,200
that the point behind the existence is

357
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,119
this play right it's ultimately playful

358
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,360
this divine dance

359
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,879
it gets awfully complicated in the

360
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:25,839
gnostic and neoplatonic schools these

361
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:27,120
chains of being from godhead down to us

362
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,120
right

363
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,560
some invisible right

364
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
and we're going to get into terence

365
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,799
mckenna territory later on but we can

366
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:37,359
start now by talking about discarnate

367
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:39,759
entities and archons and aliens and

368
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,159
archetypes i mean there is a a world

369
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:44,958
where terrence mckenna does meet plato

370
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,360
and gnosticism um quite kindly and that

371
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,559
that's in the um this invisible college

372
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,519
right the um

373
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:54,078
the invisible world uh with which we

374
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,039
seem to have some kind of symbiosis

375
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:59,359
um that has a higher intent maybe even a

376
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,519
purpose or a plan in mind for us so i

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,839
mean these ideas come across when you've

378
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,759
had a heroic dose of mushrooms um they

379
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,839
also pop up in the ancient philosophical

380
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:08,559
literature this idea of archons who you

381
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,440
know

382
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:13,759
the puppet masters controlling us flesh

383
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,160
and blood beings

384
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,000
it's all uh it's all a cosmic dance and

385
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,600
there are no answers to this first who

386
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,039
are the archons the second what is this

387
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,240
world where transformative means

388
00:14:21,039 --> 00:14:23,919
play-doh do you mean in the space of

389
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,680
ideas

390
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,198
or are we talking about some kind of

391
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:29,359
world that connects all of consciousness

392
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:31,198
throughout human history i think through

393
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,879
different techniques it is you know i

394
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,399
think a lot about i think gordon wassen

395
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,480
is the meeting point of the two so so

396
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,600
gordon watson who i do talk about in the

397
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,399
book uh was this um jp morgan banker

398
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,399
turned ethnomycologist and he's largely

399
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,720
credited with the rediscovery

400
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,559
of psilocybin containing mushrooms

401
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,360
which kind of gave rise to the pop

402
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,919
psychedelic revolution of the 1960s

403
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,159
he visited maria sabina down in mexico

404
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,399
in his wake when bob dylan led zeppelin

405
00:14:56,159 --> 00:15:00,559
the stones and everybody else

406
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,759
and the way he describes his psilocybin

407
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,278
experience

408
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:04,879
is a bit strange because he thinks of

409
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:07,120
plato right

410
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,039
and he says that you know whereas our

411
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,679
ordinary reality is kind of this

412
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:13,838
imperfect view of things

413
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,000
gordon watson felt that on mushrooms he

414
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,760
was spying the archetypes and he talks

415
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,759
about plato and he writes about the

416
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,198
archetypes in this famous article that's

417
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:24,559
released in 1957 in life magazine and so

418
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,639
a well-read

419
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,759
individual from the mid-20th century has

420
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,919
his

421
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:32,000
premier psychedelic experience and

422
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:34,879
outcomes plato because what he was

423
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,078
witnessing was so sharp so brilliant so

424
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,639
detailed

425
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,559
in some sense more real than real this

426
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,879
noetic sense that william james talks

427
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:45,359
about that when you confront something

428
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:47,519
more real than real these discarnate

429
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,839
entities these images

430
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,879
this uh these visionary motifs you're

431
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,560
tempted

432
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:54,879
to believe that you've tapped into the

433
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:56,719
truest nature and the underlying

434
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,320
structure of the cosmos and that's

435
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,399
difficult to escape from whether you're

436
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,160
plato or terence mckenna or gordon

437
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,159
watson caught in between

438
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,759
so we talk about this

439
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,439
being in touch with something that is

440
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,199
more real than real

441
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,959
and let's just go straight there to

442
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,758
mckenna before we return to the bigger

443
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,000
picture so he's talked about the uh what

444
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,919
is it self-healing machina self

445
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,799
self-transforming self-transforming

446
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:22,319
machine i was during his uh

447
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:23,359
dmt

448
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,519
travels

449
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,839
and uh i just talked to rick doblin who

450
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,480
also had different travels through this

451
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,480
hyperspace

452
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:34,000
but they're all seem to be traveling on

453
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,000
the same spaceships just to different

454
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,639
locations and there is a sense in which

455
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,720
they seem to be traveling

456
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,879
through whatever i don't know if it's

457
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,839
through space time or something else to

458
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,240
meet

459
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,920
something that is more real than real uh

460
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,560
what can you say about this dmt

461
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,719
experience about terence mckenna about

462
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,198
the poetry he used but maybe more

463
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,040
specifically about this place that they

464
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,120
seem to all travel to

465
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,120
so the big question is is it real is it

466
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,639
really more real than real the ancient

467
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,519
philosophers were asking the same

468
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,519
question and their means of attempting

469
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,519
to answer that was by dying

470
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,759
so if you ask plato the definition of

471
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,000
philosophy he will say that

472
00:17:11,759 --> 00:17:16,879
to practice it in the right way

473
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,439
is to practice dying and being dead and

474
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,039
many people describe the psychedelic

475
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,798
experience in sort of near-death

476
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,480
experience terms

477
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,359
um and the encountering of all this

478
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,519
visual imagery tends to be something

479
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,038
that is often described as more real

480
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,960
than real so how does terence talk about

481
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,599
this so i was just listening to the

482
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,960
trial logs which folks should look up um

483
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,399
somewhere between 1989 and 1990 terence

484
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,400
sits down

485
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:45,200
with his friends ralph abraham and

486
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,519
rupert sheldrake at esalen and they're

487
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,840
they're trying to figure out the meaning

488
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,839
of these discarnate entities and these

489
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,319
non-human intelligences

490
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:56,720
and terence develops a taxonomy for how

491
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,599
to analyze this and he says that number

492
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,880
one

493
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,678
they're either

494
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,760
um semi-physical

495
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:06,320
but kind of elusive so think of the

496
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,640
bigfoot or the yeti or things like this

497
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,200
um beings that exist somewhere between

498
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,200
mythology and zoology

499
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,840
which is isn't really appropriate here

500
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,038
so so uh option number two

501
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:20,720
he says is the mental i'm sorry

502
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:22,190
you're dropping so many good lines it's

503
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,160
so good okay i apologize

504
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,080
[Laughter]

505
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,759
somewhere between nostalgia and zouave

506
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,839
this is all terence mckenna okay all

507
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:32,480
right i take no credit for this uh so

508
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,558
but you're combining you're like uh jimi

509
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,720
hendrix only used the blues scale but

510
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:38,720
he's still uh he still created something

511
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,480
new in the music you played anyway go

512
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
ahead well we're going into mixolydian

513
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,079
right now okay so um

514
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,160
uh so uh option number two and this is

515
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:49,599
this what this is what uh terence calls

516
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,480
sort of the mentalist reductionist

517
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:52,798
approach

518
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,599
um and this is this is pure mechanical

519
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,798
poetry he says that these beings could

520
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,918
be autonomous fragments of psychic

521
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:04,480
energy that have temporarily escaped the

522
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:07,038
controlling power of the ego

523
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,360
um so in jungian senses these would just

524
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,279
be pure projections um the projections

525
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,279
of schizophrenics in some cases so

526
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:15,678
they're essentially unreal and the third

527
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,319
option the most tantalizing

528
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,000
is that they're both non-physical but

529
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,038
autonomous in other words they actually

530
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,119
exist

531
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:25,279
in some kind of real place

532
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:26,879
in some kind of real space and that we

533
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,519
can have congress with them there is

534
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,320
communication he talks about um the

535
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,160
whisperings of the demon artificers and

536
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:36,399
that it's just possible

537
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,558
that our meetings with these beings have

538
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,360
coaxed the human species

539
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,839
into self-expression in a very real way

540
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,079
that at different times in history our

541
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:48,558
relationships with these

542
00:19:46,079 --> 00:19:50,558
semi-autonomous beings may actually

543
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:54,319
guide the species now this is

544
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:56,960
high speculation and uh terence and

545
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,960
ralph and rupert wind up talking about

546
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,558
the early modern period and the

547
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,360
scientific enlightenment and that even

548
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,678
someone like descartes reports a dream

549
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:07,759
in which he came face to face with an

550
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,880
angel who said that the conquest of

551
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:10,480
nature

552
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,200
is to be achieved

553
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,759
uh through measure and number so so even

554
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,759
the hard-minded materialist like like

555
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:20,400
descartes is confronting these

556
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,558
discarnate entities john d in the 16th

557
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,120
century the high magician of the

558
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:28,079
elizabethan court

559
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,439
he reports decades worth of what we

560
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:31,519
would say is extraterrestrial

561
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,720
communication or interdimensional

562
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:36,000
communication

563
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,679
um and you can find instances of this

564
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,240
throughout history including among the

565
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,240
pre-socratics um and peter kingsley

566
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,480
writes quite a bit about this but i'll

567
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,880
save that until your next question well

568
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,720
first of all we don't seem to understand

569
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,840
from where intelligence came from we

570
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,558
don't understand

571
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:54,158
from where life came from on earth

572
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,279
but that we can kind of into it because

573
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:56,960
that's the space of chemistry and

574
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,200
biology you have good theories about the

575
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,440
origins of life on earth but the origins

576
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,400
of intelligent life

577
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,640
that is is a giant mystery and

578
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,600
there's some sense in which

579
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,320
i mean i don't know if you know the

580
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:11,038
movie 2001 space odyssey

581
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:12,720
but

582
00:21:11,038 --> 00:21:14,400
it does seem that there is like

583
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,319
important

584
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,440
throughout human history throughout life

585
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:20,480
on earth there's important phase shifts

586
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,120
of

587
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,440
it feels like something happened

588
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:28,239
where there's big leaps

589
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,080
it could be something coincidental like

590
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,839
fire and learning how to cook meat and

591
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,158
all those kinds of things

592
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:36,798
but it feels like there could be other

593
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,640
things and i think that's at the core of

594
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,918
your work is exploring what those things

595
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,840
could be

596
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,679
is there is it

597
00:21:42,839 --> 00:21:46,558
possible talked about joe rogan offline

598
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,720
is it

599
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:51,200
it's entirely possible is it possible

600
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,640
that psychedelics have in fact

601
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,600
contributed

602
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,919
of being an important uh source of those

603
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,399
phase shifts throughout human history of

604
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,799
the intel basically steering the

605
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,960
intellectual development and growth of

606
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:07,519
human civilization

607
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:09,519
it's a hypothesis worth investigating

608
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,200
how about that beautiful and

609
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:12,798
and maybe not psychedelics in and of

610
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,558
themselves but i think our whole

611
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,679
conversation is kind of wrapped up in

612
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,079
these

613
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,159
non-ordinary states of awareness we

614
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:21,199
start by talking about god which is

615
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,159
something

616
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,400
unordinary and expansive and i think

617
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:29,200
that as you

618
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,280
as you trace the intervention of

619
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,640
divinity if that's the case

620
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,119
throughout human history you have to

621
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:37,919
bump up against the irrational um

622
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,879
mercedes the great scholar

623
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,400
of religions and fellow romanian said

624
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,080
that the history of religions

625
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,000
essentially constitutes the point of

626
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,279
intersection between metaphysics and

627
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,159
biology

628
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,720
right so that we are biological beings

629
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,480
who do interact with our planet with the

630
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,319
with the natural kingdom

631
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,720
and you would think that as you know

632
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,599
early archaic ecologists we would have

633
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,640
figured out what plants work which fungi

634
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,959
don't

635
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,559
and developed maybe language around that

636
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,640
and so this is this is another one of

637
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:11,038
mckenna's

638
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,440
speculative but very interesting

639
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:15,599
hypotheses the stoned ape theory

640
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,400
is it is it possible that psychedelics

641
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:19,918
were involved in one of the several

642
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,798
leaps forward you mentioned the word

643
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,559
leap

644
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:24,798
jared diamond talks about the great leap

645
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:26,639
forward 60 000 years ago

646
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:28,639
the species had been around for a couple

647
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,480
hundred thousand years all of a sudden

648
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,320
the cave painting appears

649
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,480
all of a sudden there's a phase shift

650
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:36,319
did something like that happen millions

651
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,079
of years ago and i love the way paul

652
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,279
stamets talks about this it would be the

653
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,240
ingestion

654
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:45,119
of perhaps psilocybin containing fungi

655
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,919
millions and millions of times

656
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:50,079
over millions and millions of years so

657
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:51,600
it's not just a one-time event that

658
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,639
cascades but it's this it's the

659
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:57,359
accumulation of psychedelic experience

660
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,038
that it's really difficult to test that

661
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,359
hypothesis

662
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,720
but i've been talking with a

663
00:24:00,359 --> 00:24:04,558
paleoanthropologist in south africa my

664
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,558
friend lee berger

665
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:09,200
about ways that we might test for this

666
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:12,000
and so lee amongst many things is this

667
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,798
national geographic explorer

668
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,759
he's the paleoanthropologist

669
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:17,278
paleoanthropologist at the university of

670
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,679
waterstrength

671
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,679
he's famous amongst other things for the

672
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,240
discovery of previously undiscovered

673
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:26,880
hominids like homo naledi

674
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:29,120
and there's an interesting point

675
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,080
um so naledi

676
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,278
is

677
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:36,319
this archaic hominid morphologically

678
00:24:33,278 --> 00:24:37,440
archaic but it dates to about 300 000

679
00:24:36,319 --> 00:24:39,678
years ago

680
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,440
which is very strange um what's even

681
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,278
more strange about homo naledi at the

682
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,759
rising star cave system there in south

683
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:48,640
africa is that lee believes he's

684
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:51,278
discovered the first bipedal ape

685
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,080
deliberately disposing of its dead

686
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,839
um so there is a recognition of

687
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:57,918
self-mortality

688
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,240
and the practicing of rituals around

689
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:03,200
death we're talking about burials and if

690
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,480
you have burials says lee in an archaic

691
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,400
hominid 300 000 years ago maybe you have

692
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,640
language and i mentioned that because

693
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,278
terence mckenna was obsessed with

694
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,440
language in the stone dape theory that

695
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:18,640
the ingestion of psilocybin in addition

696
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,960
to enhancing visual acuity perhaps

697
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,278
facilitating sexual arousal

698
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:25,600
leads to proto-language

699
00:25:23,278 --> 00:25:27,278
now isn't it interesting this could be

700
00:25:25,599 --> 00:25:30,719
entirely a coincidence

701
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:32,720
that the largest sound inventory of any

702
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:35,038
language is the koi-san

703
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,679
of botswana and namibia

704
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:40,319
they have something like 164 consonants

705
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,559
and 44 vowels english by comparison has

706
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,399
about 45. so i don't know what to make

707
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,480
of this but what you find in that part

708
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,120
of the world is very

709
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,599
very complex language

710
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,759
language that could be an inheritance

711
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:56,079
language that could be incredibly

712
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:58,558
archaic together with this recognition

713
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,918
of self-mortality and when i talk to lee

714
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,798
berger we say when you're looking at

715
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,200
universals like that language around all

716
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:07,599
human populations the recognition of

717
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,640
self-mortality the contemplation of

718
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:12,240
death just maybe you have pharmacology

719
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
and so maybe we can go out and test for

720
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,798
this

721
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,519
using gas chromatography mass

722
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:19,519
spectrometry proteomics technology that

723
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:21,918
doesn't even exist but maybe we can

724
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:23,918
actually test the stone tape theory to

725
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,000
figure out once and for all if there's

726
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,679
any merit there can you just linger a

727
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,759
little bit on the pharmacology tools

728
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,320
like how how would you how would it be

729
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:35,119
possible to say something about what was

730
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:37,678
being ingested so so so long ago that's

731
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,879
what i asked dr berger

732
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:42,559
so lee

733
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,600
has discovered um in the dental calculus

734
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:47,359
nice of archaic hominids dental calculus

735
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,759
i like that

736
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,278
evidence of their diet and

737
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:54,720
you might not believe how old this was

738
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:57,200
but in in sediba australopithecus sediba

739
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,079
they found evidence of sadiba's diet

740
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,159
going back 2 million years

741
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:03,678
so through things like phytoliths which

742
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,720
are essentially

743
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:09,679
fossilized plant tissue they found

744
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,519
evidence that sediba was eating bark and

745
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:15,840
leaves and grasses and fruits and palm

746
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:17,440
so no psychedelics to speak of but it

747
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,000
just goes to show that through things

748
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:21,679
like dental microwave analysis and other

749
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,519
techniques that we're still developing

750
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,000
we can actually figure out what the diet

751
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:27,918
was at the time i'll fast forward to 50

752
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,759
000 years ago

753
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,000
there was another study out of el cidron

754
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,798
cave in 2012 which found that

755
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,880
neanderthals again preceding our species

756
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:40,079
50 000 years ago

757
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,760
were ingesting yarrow and chamomile

758
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:44,319
which had been identified as medicinal

759
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,640
so again not psychedelic or psychoactive

760
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:48,319
but we kind of have the beginnings of

761
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,038
the technology and this that was nine

762
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:53,839
years ago to begin figuring out the

763
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:55,599
ancestral diet of these hominids

764
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,918
presumably there could be a way to

765
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:59,839
figure out it's not just diet but which

766
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,520
are have psychoactive elements to them

767
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:03,199
so whether you're chewing it whether

768
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:05,359
you're smoking it whether i mean i don't

769
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,360
know what licking it i don't know if

770
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,439
there's any kind of ways through the

771
00:28:07,359 --> 00:28:11,278
dental calculus to figure out

772
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,480
which exact substances were being

773
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,640
consumed

774
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,798
is it possible to figure out whether

775
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,520
psychedelic substances are being

776
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:22,639
consumed by looking at human behavior

777
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:25,200
like you said organized burials

778
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,559
or cave paintings

779
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,480
no but so that's a little bit of a

780
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,960
stretch to say like where did the sleep

781
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,440
come from but it's not it's not so so so

782
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,798
just last fall as a matter of fact so

783
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,960
that that notion has been out there for

784
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,440
a while the idea that hallucinogens and

785
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,278
the ritual consumption of hallucinogens

786
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,440
were somehow related to the great leap

787
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:45,038
forward or somehow related to the

788
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,480
initial cape pain and graham hancock

789
00:28:45,038 --> 00:28:48,720
wrote a beautiful book about this called

790
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,798
supernatural which in many ways like

791
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,278
sent me down this rabbit hole back in

792
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,480
2007. and so but even at the time when

793
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:55,679
he was writing that in the year

794
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,839
subsequent

795
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,798
it was still kind of seen as a kooky

796
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:00,798
idea

797
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,319
last fall

798
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:04,639
interestingly enough

799
00:29:02,319 --> 00:29:06,319
the first archaeochemical data for the

800
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,200
ritual consumption

801
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:11,678
of psychedelics associated with cave art

802
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,200
was finally published it's it's not that

803
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,720
ancient it's only about four or five

804
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,679
hundred years ago but it came from the

805
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,679
pinwheel cave a chumash site in in

806
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,600
california and what they found were

807
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,519
datura quids like these chewed up you

808
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,558
mentioned how did they ingest it these

809
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,798
chewed up quids like these these bunches

810
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:31,278
of datura which contain these very

811
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:34,000
powerful tropane alkaloids and what was

812
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:36,079
believed to be some kind of chumash

813
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,759
initiation site so we can say that there

814
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:39,439
is initial

815
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,278
you know archaeochemical data for the

816
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,080
consumption of psychedelics and cave art

817
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:46,079
and so where else might we find this

818
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:47,199
are there a lot of archaeochemists in

819
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:49,759
the world

820
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,440
like because this is fascinating it's

821
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:54,240
through chemistry

822
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:56,320
through biology through physics whatever

823
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,240
like all the disciplines we perhaps one

824
00:29:56,319 --> 00:29:59,839
day computer science

825
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,720
we um

826
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:05,439
apply those tools to study not the data

827
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,759
of today but the data of the past

828
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,440
are we talking about dozens here

829
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:11,119
like how hard is this problem relative

830
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,360
to how many people are taking it on just

831
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:14,798
as a side a little tangent we're

832
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,918
probably talking

833
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:20,480
more dozens than hundreds um i

834
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,759
spent many years trying to track down an

835
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,480
archaeochemist who would talk to me

836
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:26,398
there were a couple um pat mcgovern at

837
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,798
the university of pennsylvania yeah and

838
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,199
then my friend andrew ko at mit which

839
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:34,079
you might know something about um andrew

840
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,360
really you know on his own time on his

841
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:38,240
own dime

842
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:41,278
has been gathering the data

843
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,880
for this organic residue analysis um he

844
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,440
has what's called the open r chem

845
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,440
project which is this online open source

846
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,600
repository for this data but there's

847
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,000
never been a center for this no

848
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,918
university has stood up a dedicated

849
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,720
center a team really which is what you

850
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,640
need

851
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,159
of archaeochemists looking at this stuff

852
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,159
but i mean even despite that there have

853
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:02,080
been some remarkable discoveries

854
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,000
over the past 10 20 years it's still a

855
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:06,158
discipline very much in its infancy

856
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,759
maybe it's becoming a toddler but as the

857
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,278
technology gets better and cheaper um i

858
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,558
hope uh you'll see more and more

859
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,038
archaeochemists

860
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:17,038
joining the fight yeah and andrew is

861
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:19,359
fascinating his work is fascinating but

862
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,759
uh also i just because of because of

863
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,398
your work i came across an exchange a

864
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,240
few emails with patrick mcgovern

865
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,558
who's basically what would you call him

866
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,399
so he has a center i guess that's

867
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,278
does biomolecular archaeology at upenn

868
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:34,959
and

869
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:36,798
he's the author of a bunch of books one

870
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,679
of which is ancient bruise

871
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:41,599
so he's a scholar of beer and wine

872
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,600
and like ancient alcohol which is

873
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:45,359
fascinating they influence even just

874
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,278
alcohol but he has like

875
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:49,918
alcohol with um

876
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:52,079
hallucinogenic properties as well but

877
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,399
it's fascinating the influ as a russian

878
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,558
it's fascinating to uh

879
00:31:54,398 --> 00:31:58,719
to think about the influence of alcohol

880
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,879
on the development

881
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,558
of human civilization throughout its

882
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:04,960
history is this is there something you

883
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:08,558
can comment on

884
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:11,038
alcohol or in general

885
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:13,839
patrick's work that was informative to

886
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,158
you inspiring or kind of

887
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,480
added to your conception of of human

888
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,880
history his work was some of the first

889
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,599
hard scientific data that i saw for the

890
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,399
ritual consumption of these intoxicants

891
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,079
um i don't think he's ever found

892
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,839
the hard and fast data for for

893
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,439
psychedelics but what he turned me on to

894
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:33,519
was this idea

895
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,798
that alcohol or beer and wine

896
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,798
specifically

897
00:32:34,798 --> 00:32:38,639
could have been used as vehicles for the

898
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:40,879
administration of psychedelics that's

899
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,600
where it all started for me um just just

900
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,840
the notion that ancient beer and ancient

901
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,839
wine is very very different from what we

902
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,398
drink today that typically they were

903
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:53,599
cocktails they were often fortified and

904
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:56,558
mixed with different fruits berries

905
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:58,398
herbs plants maybe even fungi over time

906
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,038
because this was all in the absence of

907
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:03,359
distilled liquor right there is no hard

908
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,398
alcohol even in russia

909
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:06,798
before

910
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:09,439
maybe the 12th century it was in europe

911
00:33:06,798 --> 00:33:12,240
maybe a bit earlier but the the concept

912
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,798
of distillation just didn't exist and so

913
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,480
you know to pack a punch um

914
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:18,798
you know rather than just drink a kind

915
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,278
of watered-down budweiser these people

916
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:23,519
were interested in fortifying these

917
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:26,000
beverages with whatever they could find

918
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,720
in nature and and pat to his credit

919
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,720
found some of the initial data for these

920
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,480
um you could say spiked wines and spiked

921
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,640
beers not with anything overtly

922
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,558
psychedelic but just the fact that in

923
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:40,799
the 16th century bc at grave circle a in

924
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,119
my senai there's this minoan ritual

925
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:45,278
cocktail of beer mixed with wine mixed

926
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:47,038
with mead is very interesting it's even

927
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:50,398
more interesting that you find that

928
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:53,359
across the aegean um in gordium at king

929
00:33:50,398 --> 00:33:55,918
midas tomb right the same kind of ritual

930
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:58,240
cocktail which pat and sam at the

931
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,080
dogfish head brewery uh resurrected as

932
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,798
the midas touch so i mean the notion

933
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,599
that we can go back find this data

934
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:07,519
resurrect it in some cases 2 800 years

935
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:08,878
later i found pretty exciting 10 years

936
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,679
ago

937
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,960
yeah bringing back for research

938
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:14,240
but that's that's fascinating that

939
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,039
people were playing with these ideas and

940
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,039
we'll return to

941
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,720
we'll return to ideas of psychedelic

942
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,639
confused wine which is pretty

943
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,559
fascinating but can we step back and

944
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,480
just kind of look at your work with the

945
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,639
the book immortality key

946
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,320
what is the story that you tell in this

947
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,639
book i knew we'd get there eventually

948
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,639
lex

949
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:37,918
it's a non-linear path

950
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,000
somehow we were talking about simulation

951
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:42,559
and the universe is a computer that's

952
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,079
creating video games and wow and uh

953
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,320
fortnite but

954
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:49,519
we got there and we'll return

955
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,280
always to insane philosophical but uh

956
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,599
your book can mortality what what's the

957
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,119
story that you tell in this book

958
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,320
what do you which part of human history

959
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,838
are you studying

960
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,680
right so that's that's the way to phrase

961
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:00,799
it so it's you know it's my 12-year

962
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,440
search

963
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:05,440
for the hard scientific data

964
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,519
for the ritual use of psychedelics and

965
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,119
classical antiquity so we're talking

966
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:10,239
about amongst the ancient greeks and

967
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:12,240
romans

968
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,319
and the paleo christians

969
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,239
so the generations that would give birth

970
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,240
to the largest religion the world's ever

971
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,479
known christianity today was two and a

972
00:35:18,239 --> 00:35:22,479
half billion people the big question for

973
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,599
me is you know were psychedelics

974
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,679
actually involved there was a lot

975
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,720
written about this in the 60s john marco

976
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:28,679
allegro

977
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:31,598
the book that i follow was published in

978
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:32,879
1978 before i was born the road to

979
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,559
ellucis

980
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,880
by gordon watson who we talked about

981
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,119
already albert hofmann who famously

982
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,599
discovers lsd or synthesizes it from

983
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,720
ergot and karl ruck

984
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,880
who is still a professor of classics at

985
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:49,838
boston university the only surviving

986
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:52,880
member of that renegade trio and now 85

987
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:55,759
years old so this this all predates us

988
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,160
um but what was lacking in the 60s 70s

989
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,359
80s 90s i think was some of this

990
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:01,679
technology

991
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,598
and and the hard scientific data now for

992
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:05,519
years and years i went out to the

993
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,960
archaeobotanists and the archaeochemists

994
00:36:05,519 --> 00:36:10,000
around the world and i asked a very

995
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:12,000
basic question is there any evidence

996
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,159
for psychedelics and classical antiquity

997
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,559
and the answer would almost invariably

998
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:18,159
come back no i'm talking to in addition

999
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,358
to pat he put me in touch with hans

1000
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:22,399
peter stika in germany tania valamotti

1001
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,559
in greece

1002
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,559
florenzano in italy i went all over the

1003
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,799
place asking one question and getting

1004
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:31,440
the same answer back time and again and

1005
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,000
so the book is essentially my my search

1006
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,079
for that data and the eventual

1007
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,199
uncovering of two what i think are key

1008
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,800
pieces of data one data

1009
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:43,759
one data point

1010
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,960
shows the ritual use of a psychedelic

1011
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,040
beer

1012
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,519
in classical antiquity in iberia with

1013
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:52,159
today's spain and the other shows what

1014
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,920
looks like a kind of psychedelic wine

1015
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:56,639
just outside pompeii from the first

1016
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,119
century a.d at the right place at the

1017
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:01,519
right time when the earliest christians

1018
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,680
were showing up in italy

1019
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:07,838
again these are early steps in the

1020
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:10,239
search for evidence in the space but uh

1021
00:37:07,838 --> 00:37:12,639
speaking of early christians

1022
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:14,879
what role do you think

1023
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:16,319
psychedelic infused wine could have

1024
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:18,720
played

1025
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,960
in the life of

1026
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,959
the

1027
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:25,519
i i won't be clever in the life of jesus

1028
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,280
christ

1029
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:28,920
i've been saying recently that and i

1030
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,800
hope this doesn't sound

1031
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,358
obscurantist but

1032
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:35,280
i think it's impossible

1033
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,039
to understand jesus

1034
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,800
and the birth of christianity in the

1035
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,239
absence of ancient greek

1036
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,880
and i'll give you a very specific

1037
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:46,078
example of why i think that's the case

1038
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,039
you can read the entire new testament

1039
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:52,240
in ancient greek and not once will you

1040
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,759
ever find a reference to alcohol

1041
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:55,919
because there was no word in ancient

1042
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,000
greek for alcohol the way the word

1043
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,240
sounds alcohol it comes it's semitic it

1044
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,559
comes from the arabic

1045
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:05,358
khala means to enliven a refresh it

1046
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:07,279
probably comes from coal kohl sort of

1047
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,838
these powdered metallics that were used

1048
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,320
in alchemical experiments and cosmetics

1049
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,078
so again that's much later in time

1050
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:17,359
when we're using alchemy distillation

1051
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,320
etc in the first century ad

1052
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:23,199
the power of wine wasn't necessarily

1053
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,440
tied to alcohol right fermented grapes

1054
00:38:23,199 --> 00:38:27,039
the way we think about wine today so pat

1055
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,519
mcgovern found some of that early

1056
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:31,119
organic data for wine being mixed

1057
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,519
with uh

1058
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,599
with beer and with mead but if you look

1059
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,679
at the literature from the first century

1060
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,760
a.d diocerities for example he writes

1061
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:42,159
this this massive treatise at the exact

1062
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,839
same time the gospels are being written

1063
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,399
and diascorides

1064
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:48,159
in just one of his books talks about 56

1065
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,480
detailed recipes

1066
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,519
for spiking wine with all kinds of

1067
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,199
things like salvia and hellebore and

1068
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:57,679
frankincense and myrrh these spiced

1069
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:00,480
perfumes but also more dangerous things

1070
00:38:57,679 --> 00:39:02,399
like henbane and mandrake which he says

1071
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,838
in greek can be fatal with just one

1072
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,960
cupful and in book 474 of his materia

1073
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,119
medica

1074
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,800
he talks about black nightshade

1075
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,838
producing fantasias

1076
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,519
none not unpleasant visions

1077
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,078
what today we would say is psychedelic

1078
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:21,599
so just looking at the literature and

1079
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:23,920
the kind of literature that even most

1080
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,760
classicists i didn't really learn it in

1081
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,760
undergrad i came across diasporities

1082
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,240
later um

1083
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,880
just a basic look at the literature

1084
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:34,879
supports what mcgovern has been testing

1085
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,920
which is the fact that wine was

1086
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,200
routinely mixed with different compounds

1087
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,119
it's fascinating by the way that

1088
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:42,639
language affects our

1089
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,400
conception

1090
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,759
of the tools we use to understand the

1091
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,838
world so like

1092
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,079
like it you can see wine

1093
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,279
you can see psychedelics

1094
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,760
if they're not

1095
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,119
called drugs

1096
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,839
you can uh

1097
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:59,599
you can maybe reframe

1098
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:01,759
how you see them in terms of their role

1099
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,800
in on us thinking about the world

1100
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,800
understanding the world that's really

1101
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,800
interesting that language has that power

1102
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,039
but what language was used to understand

1103
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,359
wine at the time so we're talking about

1104
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,559
a greek speaking world right so you know

1105
00:40:11,358 --> 00:40:14,880
jesus

1106
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,239
uh is born and does his public ministry

1107
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,760
in the holy land but think about the

1108
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:19,919
early church think about where the

1109
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,760
church takes root you know paul the

1110
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,680
greatest evangelist of the time writes

1111
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,079
basically half the new testament he's

1112
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:28,480
writing letters in greek to greek

1113
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:29,760
speakers in places like corinth

1114
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,800
in greece

1115
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,119
or philippi a defunct city just north of

1116
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,680
the island of thaus or he's writing to

1117
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,599
folks in what today is is turkey uh the

1118
00:40:37,679 --> 00:40:42,078
colossians the galatians he writes

1119
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,800
letters to the romans um these are greek

1120
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,000
speakers in these pockets these hellenic

1121
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,560
pockets all around the ancient

1122
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,119
mediterranean and for them again

1123
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:53,838
ignore discordies ignore pat mcgovern's

1124
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,400
work to them to think about wine was to

1125
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:59,119
think about a mixed a mixed potion and

1126
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,480
so the word oinos in ancient greek does

1127
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,200
show up in the new testament but there

1128
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,920
was another word to describe wine and it

1129
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:08,239
exists for like a thousand years before

1130
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,599
during and after the life of jesus the

1131
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:13,199
word used for wine is farmacon which

1132
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,400
obviously gives us the word pharmacy it

1133
00:41:13,199 --> 00:41:16,159
means drug

1134
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,240
so in greek a greek speaker would

1135
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,559
actually use the word drug

1136
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:22,719
to refer to wine uh ruth skodal the

1137
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:25,599
classicist talks about this as a as a

1138
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:26,559
ritualistic formula um they understood

1139
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,599
wine

1140
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:32,880
as this compound beverage a drug against

1141
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,359
grief um a medicinal elixir

1142
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,760
that could either harm or heal or just

1143
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:41,199
maybe a sacrament to put you in touch

1144
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,480
with wine gods old and new

1145
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,838
clearly

1146
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,358
religion

1147
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:47,759
and myth but

1148
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,239
religion very much so has

1149
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,720
sort of uh

1150
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:54,879
much like dreams has like an imagery

1151
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:57,519
component like

1152
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:59,680
you're kind of going outside

1153
00:41:57,519 --> 00:41:59,679
the

1154
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:03,199
visual constraints of physical space

1155
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,920
where you kind of have

1156
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,838
very specific conceptions of what things

1157
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,079
look like and you kind of use your

1158
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:13,039
imagination to

1159
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,079
stretch beyond the world as we know it

1160
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:15,679
things that are

1161
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,359
try to get in touch with things that are

1162
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,078
more real than real

1163
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:21,039
what role do these tools

1164
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,200
do these

1165
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:26,318
uh farmicons

1166
00:42:23,199 --> 00:42:28,078
have in trying to stimulate the imagery

1167
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:29,838
of religion like

1168
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,760
do you have a sense that they have a

1169
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:33,599
critical role here or is this just a

1170
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:35,440
bunch of different factors

1171
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,800
that are utilized a bunch of different

1172
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,119
tools that are utilized to construct

1173
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:40,880
this imagery or is this not even or is

1174
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:43,760
imagery the wrong terminology is it more

1175
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,680
like space of ideas that's core to to

1176
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,400
religion no i think the wine is

1177
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:50,239
absolutely essential and so if it's

1178
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,000
impossible to understand paleo

1179
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,639
christianity in the absence of ancient

1180
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,400
greek i think it's equally difficult in

1181
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:59,279
the absence of

1182
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,200
the sacred pharmacopoeia or wine itself

1183
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:03,119
right just think about wine

1184
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:04,639
at the time um i i think that the

1185
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:08,160
ancient greek audience would have heard

1186
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:10,000
that in a very different way um from us

1187
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,519
and so they're referring to it maybe as

1188
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,239
a pharmacon but the followers of

1189
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,599
dionysus which precedes jesus and in

1190
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:17,199
some cases

1191
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:19,119
the story of jesus is kind of a

1192
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:20,559
recapitulation of the mysteries of

1193
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,400
dionysus but when you think about

1194
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:24,000
dionysus

1195
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,760
maybe from your high school mythology

1196
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,079
you think about him as the god of

1197
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,079
theater or the god of wine which is

1198
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,599
typically what it is or the god of

1199
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,079
ecstasy

1200
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:37,039
you know again dionysus is not the god

1201
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,359
of alcohol there's no there's no concept

1202
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:41,519
of of fermented grapes the power of

1203
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:43,598
dionysus and the ability to commune with

1204
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:46,000
dionysus through his blood

1205
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,720
and before christianity the blood

1206
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,119
of dionysus is equated to his wine the

1207
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:53,039
sacramental drinking of the wine was

1208
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,119
interpreted and classicist write about

1209
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,679
this including walter berkert

1210
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,920
it was interpreted as consuming the god

1211
00:43:57,679 --> 00:44:01,440
himself in order to become one with the

1212
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,920
god this is where we get the idea of

1213
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,400
enthusiasm because the language matters

1214
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,880
enthusiasm to be filled with the spirit

1215
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,280
of the god so that you became identified

1216
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,200
with dionysus and acquired his divine

1217
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,119
powers now how does that happen

1218
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:17,199
again he's not the god of alcohol he is

1219
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,760
the god of wine but he's really the god

1220
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,318
of madness and delirium

1221
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,560
and frenzy and his principal followers

1222
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:26,480
are women they're called the mine ads

1223
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:27,838
and the way they get in touch with him

1224
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,838
is through the consumption of the

1225
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,559
sacramental wine

1226
00:44:29,838 --> 00:44:35,119
even at the theater of dionysus

1227
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:37,519
separate from his outdoor churches there

1228
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:39,680
was a wine served there called drima

1229
00:44:37,519 --> 00:44:41,759
and this is the wine that gives birth to

1230
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:43,279
hollywood i mean the ancient hollywood

1231
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,359
was there at the theater of dionysus

1232
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,280
this is where comedy and tragedy and

1233
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:48,960
poetry and music come from

1234
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,160
but rather than a hot dog and a beer

1235
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,880
what they drink at the theater of

1236
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:55,598
dionysus was this wine called trima

1237
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,440
which means pounded or rubbed and

1238
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,480
professor ruck talks about maybe it was

1239
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:02,240
the drugs that were rubbed into this

1240
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,358
theatrical beverage

1241
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,679
to help

1242
00:45:03,358 --> 00:45:07,598
uh the play come alive so madness is

1243
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:09,279
seen as a positive thing is it like a

1244
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,000
creative journey

1245
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,000
it's not it's not uh

1246
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:16,000
it's it's the what is it the unlearning

1247
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,239
getting out of the way kind of thing

1248
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,559
is is that how it seen or is it more

1249
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:21,919
like um

1250
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,119
entertaining

1251
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,318
escape

1252
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,318
from life that is suffering

1253
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:32,639
okay i gotta i gotta inject a little

1254
00:45:28,318 --> 00:45:35,279
modern dostoevsky into the old

1255
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:36,159
despair um maybe it's maybe it's a bit

1256
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,200
of that

1257
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:41,759
we we can't say that there wasn't

1258
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:45,118
recreational drinking happening um the

1259
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,720
greeks also have the symposium right um

1260
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,200
and they also were just getting hammered

1261
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:52,399
in some cases yeah but when it comes to

1262
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:54,480
the rights of dionysus yeah what you see

1263
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,079
there is um

1264
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,400
the creation

1265
00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:00,480
of these states of awareness in which

1266
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,720
again you identify with the god to

1267
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:05,199
become the god there's there's theophagy

1268
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:06,879
there's the consumption of divinity in

1269
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,279
order to become divinity right back to

1270
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:12,000
how we started the conversation right so

1271
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,160
if we stop conceiving of god as

1272
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,599
something exterior to us but that the

1273
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:17,679
mystery

1274
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,760
of being itself is the mystery of your

1275
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:22,159
being and the mystery of my being that

1276
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:25,760
the way to encounter that is through the

1277
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:28,399
sacramental theology that you drink

1278
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:29,440
the actual blood of this greek god to

1279
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,440
become

1280
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,440
that god and there was a place for this

1281
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,480
in ancient greek society so drinking the

1282
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,480
wine and drinking the blood of dionysus

1283
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,639
do you think jesus

1284
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,519
is

1285
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:47,039
an actual physical person that existed

1286
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:48,318
in history or is he an idea

1287
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:51,440
that

1288
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:54,159
came to to life through the consumption

1289
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,519
of wine and those kinds of rituals so

1290
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:57,118
this is where i faced my ex

1291
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:57,670
communication depending how i answer

1292
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,400
this

1293
00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:02,639
[Laughter]

1294
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,590
i mean you're you're playing with fire

1295
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:04,879
and wine

1296
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:06,240
[Laughter]

1297
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,358
that's a good combination by the way

1298
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,879
yeah

1299
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:12,078
uh so

1300
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:13,920
i i shy away from that controversy in

1301
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,960
the book i'm perfectly willing to accept

1302
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:18,880
jesus as a historical personage um you

1303
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,480
know we have the multiplicity of sources

1304
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,039
although it's a generation after his

1305
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,838
death um but we have the eucharist being

1306
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,599
described in the four gospels we have it

1307
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,759
being described by paul

1308
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:31,838
in first corinthians

1309
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,760
but when you read john it does read a

1310
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:35,279
bit differently than the other gospels

1311
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,960
and in my book i rely a lot on the

1312
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,880
scholarship of dennis mcdonald who

1313
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,559
writes a fabulous book called the

1314
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:42,559
dionysian gospel

1315
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,240
and this is again why the greek matters

1316
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,400
because once you start to analyze the

1317
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,639
greek of john's gospel

1318
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,200
it seems to be a presentation of jesus

1319
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:53,118
very much in the guise of dionysus the

1320
00:47:51,199 --> 00:47:54,558
most obvious example is the wedding at

1321
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:56,880
cana right

1322
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:59,200
that only occurs in john's gospel the

1323
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,880
famous transformation of water into wine

1324
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:03,039
now again to any greek speaker of the

1325
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,039
first century they would have known

1326
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,400
about the greek district of ellis on the

1327
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:09,279
peloponnese

1328
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,760
and in ellis around the epiphany every

1329
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,280
january the priests of dionysus would

1330
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:17,280
deposit these water basins empty basins

1331
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:18,559
in the temple of dionysus they'd return

1332
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:21,040
the next morning

1333
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:23,359
and find them magically filled with wine

1334
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,279
now on the island of andros it's even

1335
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:27,838
more interesting around the same

1336
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:30,640
epiphany date the gods gift day

1337
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:32,960
dies theodosia the wine would emanate

1338
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:34,960
from the temple and run like a river

1339
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,119
for a week and you can google the

1340
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,199
baccanal of the andreans a wonderful

1341
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,039
painting by titian which hangs in the

1342
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:43,118
prado and you'll see a river of wine

1343
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,440
behind these people having a great time

1344
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:47,440
this exists for centuries and centuries

1345
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,800
before the wedding at cana and before

1346
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:53,200
jesus begins his public ministry with

1347
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,760
what these scholars call the signature

1348
00:48:53,199 --> 00:48:58,000
miracle of dionysus it would not have

1349
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,240
been lost on the greek audience that

1350
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,440
that something very specific is being

1351
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:02,479
communicated here what's being

1352
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,720
communicated

1353
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,318
that you just might find in early

1354
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:08,239
christianity

1355
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:10,079
what you hold strong to in these

1356
00:49:08,239 --> 00:49:11,679
mysteries of dionysus that you may have

1357
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:13,680
inherited from your parents your

1358
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,679
grandparents your great grandparents for

1359
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:17,440
centuries there was a perfectly good

1360
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:19,358
religion there were perfectly good

1361
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,240
mystery cults in the ancient greek and

1362
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:24,799
roman worlds and here comes this new

1363
00:49:22,239 --> 00:49:27,199
untested illegal cult

1364
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,880
illegal of a dozen or so illiterate day

1365
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:31,439
laborers that go on to convert the

1366
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,440
empire in a few hundred years

1367
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:36,240
the answer to that

1368
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,599
extraordinary growth is not psychedelics

1369
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:39,279
but i do think it's visionary

1370
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:41,280
experiences and i do think it's this

1371
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,599
continuity from the pagan world into

1372
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:45,119
early christianity so what part you

1373
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,880
mentioned this idea that's really

1374
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:48,640
interesting though i i think you said

1375
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,318
paul stamets

1376
00:49:48,639 --> 00:49:52,159
of

1377
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:53,440
i guess millions of people over millions

1378
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,480
of years

1379
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:58,880
kind of uh consuming

1380
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:01,358
really practicing a ritual or a habit of

1381
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,720
some sort this idea of rituals is kind

1382
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:04,480
of interesting

1383
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:07,519
again you mentioned cult

1384
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,358
what's the role of ritual consumption of

1385
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:12,639
some of these substances or just ritual

1386
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:14,960
practice of anything in um the

1387
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:17,759
intellectual growth of

1388
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,240
particular groups of people or societies

1389
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,160
so again i would say it is the the

1390
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:23,919
centerpiece of ancient life not just the

1391
00:50:22,159 --> 00:50:25,440
mysteries of dionysus

1392
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,960
uh which we've only talked a bit about

1393
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:28,880
but the mysteries of ellucis were

1394
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,559
probably the most famous

1395
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,480
and longest lasting of these greek

1396
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:34,160
mystery rites and i mean just to put it

1397
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:36,318
in simple terms the best definition for

1398
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:38,558
a mystery religion um as the name

1399
00:50:36,318 --> 00:50:40,480
implies is something secret

1400
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,880
all right muo from the greek means to

1401
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:45,199
shut the eyes or or to shut the mouth up

1402
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,599
to keep quiet about this stuff um you

1403
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:50,239
know we're always teasing details

1404
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:52,318
from the archaeological and the literary

1405
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,558
record and we're kind of just

1406
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:57,119
grabbing at these at these secrets but

1407
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:59,040
ellucis which survives for like 2000

1408
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:03,599
years into the christian period from

1409
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:06,000
about 1500 bc to the 4th century a.d

1410
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,760
it's kind of this this centerpiece of

1411
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,760
greek life cicero the great roman

1412
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,800
statesman calls what was happening at a

1413
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:13,599
lucius

1414
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:16,240
the most exceptional and divine thing

1415
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,079
that athens ever produced so not

1416
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,719
democracy the arts and sciences or

1417
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,039
philosophy but the vision

1418
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:25,519
that was encountered atalusis perhaps

1419
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,759
through the ritual consumption of a

1420
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:29,599
potent psychedelic over hundreds and

1421
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,079
hundreds of years thousands and

1422
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:34,480
thousands if not millions of initiates

1423
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:37,039
pilgrims who would walk from athens to

1424
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,119
ellucis to encounter this vision

1425
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:41,199
it seems to have been

1426
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,680
not just an important part of greek life

1427
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:46,078
but the thing that made life livable

1428
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,480
such that as these mysteries are about

1429
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,720
to be exterminated by the newly

1430
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,880
christianized roman empire there's this

1431
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:54,318
passage in the ancient literature that

1432
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:56,240
talks about these you know in the

1433
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:58,719
absence of these mysteries life becomes

1434
00:51:56,239 --> 00:52:00,639
unlivable abigail

1435
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:02,719
is there ways you can i mean you write

1436
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:04,480
about the mysteries of ulysses and is

1437
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:05,439
there ways you can convert that into

1438
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,800
words

1439
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,240
why those are so important

1440
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,880
to them

1441
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:14,879
more important than any other invention

1442
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,519
to them why is it such a source of

1443
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:20,160
meaning to life

1444
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:22,400
so from what we can reconstruct

1445
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:24,239
they would make that pilgrimage 13 miles

1446
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,160
northwest of athens to confront their

1447
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:28,879
mortality remember we were talking about

1448
00:52:26,159 --> 00:52:31,358
homo naledi and in south africa this

1449
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:34,318
recognition of self-mortality

1450
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:36,960
the deliberate disposal of the dead um

1451
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,960
plato talks about the the real practice

1452
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,639
of philosophy being the the death and

1453
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:42,800
dying process so

1454
00:52:40,639 --> 00:52:43,679
in in some senses you went to elusive to

1455
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,318
die

1456
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:48,639
and to experience a a death before your

1457
00:52:46,318 --> 00:52:50,400
death we talked about this with with

1458
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:52,318
terence mckenna as well and this the how

1459
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,240
the psychedelic state

1460
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:55,599
seems to share something in common with

1461
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:57,118
the near-death or out-of-body

1462
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,760
experiences or these ecstatic

1463
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,720
experiences whether through wine or beer

1464
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,720
or otherwise you went to ellucis to die

1465
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:07,118
um and it was said that only those who

1466
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,959
had witnessed this vision whatever

1467
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:10,559
vision was to be witnessed and endemic

1468
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,960
or sanctuary

1469
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:15,040
it essentially vouch safe to uh the

1470
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:18,079
afterlife that only those who went there

1471
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:19,440
became immortal um and cicero says that

1472
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,960
um you know at that point you

1473
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,318
essentially live

1474
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:26,159
with more joy and die with a better hope

1475
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:29,039
can i ask you a question about this uh

1476
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:30,879
human contention with death this uh

1477
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:33,199
confrontation of death

1478
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:35,760
that seems to be at the core of things i

1479
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,519
i don't know how deep to the core

1480
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,760
but um

1481
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:42,000
it seems to be a central element of the

1482
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,839
human condition what do you think about

1483
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,639
ernest becker

1484
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:48,400
and those guys that put

1485
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:49,519
put death at the what is it the warm at

1486
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,358
the core

1487
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:53,838
which uh

1488
00:53:51,358 --> 00:53:55,679
as the main thing

1489
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:58,078
the the main create like this

1490
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,279
confrontation of our own mortality first

1491
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,000
of all being understand that we're

1492
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,280
mortal and then confronting the terror

1493
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:08,159
of it the the fear of it

1494
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:11,200
as the creator like trying to escape the

1495
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:13,519
fear of death as the creative force

1496
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,439
of human society it's like the reason we

1497
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:17,519
do anything is because we're just

1498
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,800
running away from our death

1499
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:21,280
scared

1500
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,680
uh do you find

1501
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:24,480
some of that to be true first of all as

1502
00:54:23,679 --> 00:54:26,159
a

1503
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,679
somebody who looks in the mirror looks

1504
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,480
at yourself and your own as a human

1505
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:33,519
being two just looking at society today

1506
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,440
and three at this whole big s spread of

1507
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,519
human history and all the cool stuff

1508
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,119
we've created including the mysteries of

1509
00:54:37,519 --> 00:54:41,280
elusive

1510
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:44,480
i wonder what life would look like in

1511
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:45,920
the absence of the fear of our mortality

1512
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,318
i wonder

1513
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,159
how we'd interact with one another

1514
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:52,239
if there was relatively little or no

1515
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,480
fear of death i really do when it comes

1516
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:56,639
to becker's work and others um if the

1517
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,480
ancients were known for anything it was

1518
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:00,480
running to death

1519
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,480
it was the opposite in fact dying before

1520
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,838
dying which is the immortality key by

1521
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,000
the way it's not psychedelic's point

1522
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:07,199
when i when i refer to this key i'm

1523
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,239
referring to this notion that's

1524
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:10,239
preserved in greek

1525
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,358
if you die before you die

1526
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:18,880
you won't die when you die

1527
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:21,039
for some reason

1528
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,039
the ancients prized

1529
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:26,079
that experience and we talked about the

1530
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:27,599
mystics of of sufism and kabbalism and

1531
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:29,599
christian mysticism

1532
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:31,280
where you have this the same self

1533
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,240
nodding this death before death the

1534
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,920
divine nothingness right for some reason

1535
00:55:34,239 --> 00:55:38,639
the mystic saints visionaries and

1536
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,720
ancient philosophers they ran to death

1537
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:42,960
and the one message i wanted to try and

1538
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:44,639
communicate with this book is how they

1539
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,960
viewed life

1540
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,480
that it can only be fully experienced

1541
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,838
fully embodied

1542
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,240
in the wake

1543
00:55:49,838 --> 00:55:54,078
of a really intense

1544
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:56,078
perhaps terrifying

1545
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,760
but utterly transformational encounter

1546
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:00,240
with death

1547
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:05,040
so running to death not running away

1548
00:56:00,239 --> 00:56:07,358
from death you talk about aldous huxley

1549
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:10,798
and mind changers

1550
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:12,078
so if we look at the history

1551
00:56:10,798 --> 00:56:14,159
where

1552
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,200
the ancients were running to death and

1553
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:20,039
maybe using some uh

1554
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:21,118
uh performance enhancing permacons

1555
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:23,039
[Laughter]

1556
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,440
to run more effectively

1557
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:26,798
towards death and now we're using

1558
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:28,159
like um

1559
00:56:26,798 --> 00:56:30,079
tools

1560
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:32,558
of modern society whether they're

1561
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,400
psychological sociological or

1562
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:36,720
pharmaceutical to run away from this

1563
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:39,519
conception so where

1564
00:56:36,719 --> 00:56:43,279
uh what do you see as a hopeful future

1565
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:45,039
for human civilization like which um

1566
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:48,240
if all of these kinds of

1567
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:51,039
uh societies or ice cream flavors how do

1568
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:52,798
you create the perfect ice cream flavor

1569
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:55,519
like what is the future of religious

1570
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:58,719
experience of psychedelic experience of

1571
00:56:55,519 --> 00:57:00,239
intellectual journeys of uh facing death

1572
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:01,679
running away from death

1573
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:03,759
what do you hope

1574
00:57:01,679 --> 00:57:05,759
uh that looks like and

1575
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,760
what kind of ideas should we look to my

1576
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,640
next book will be entitled performance

1577
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,960
enhancing pharmaka

1578
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:12,960
you get

1579
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:18,798
yeah yeah i like it so

1580
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,119
uh so but that's that's a historical

1581
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:23,119
view i mean what's what in that book

1582
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,318
would you suggest in one of the last

1583
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,200
chapters about

1584
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:29,119
the the future of this um

1585
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:31,519
of this process well hux huxley has to

1586
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,880
stop you in he stopped me in my tracks

1587
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:36,559
aldous huxley

1588
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,640
so in in 1958 he he pens this this op-ed

1589
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,880
of sorts um

1590
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:41,920
and it's just it reads incredibly

1591
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:43,920
prescient

1592
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,318
um because i really do think in many

1593
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:47,358
ways as the fog of the war drug is

1594
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:48,960
ending

1595
00:57:47,358 --> 00:57:51,598
and finally lifting

1596
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,720
that we we've kind of come full circle

1597
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:55,599
back to

1598
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:57,118
the late 1950s which might sound strange

1599
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:58,720
um it'll make more sense when you hear

1600
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,680
what huxley said about psychedelics and

1601
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:01,519
so

1602
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:02,639
he was looking forward to a revival of

1603
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:04,798
religion

1604
00:58:02,639 --> 00:58:06,879
which is why i subtitled the book the

1605
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:08,798
religion with no name

1606
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:11,680
and and to him

1607
00:58:08,798 --> 00:58:13,400
to huxley this this this revival

1608
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:15,519
wouldn't come about through

1609
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:18,639
televangelistic mass meetings or

1610
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:21,440
photogenic clergymen as he says but he

1611
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:23,759
points to the biochemical discoveries

1612
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:26,159
such as we have today that would allow

1613
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:28,880
for large numbers of men and women to

1614
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:30,879
achieve a radical self-transcendence and

1615
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,519
a deeper understanding of the nature of

1616
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,599
things in other words that this revival

1617
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:37,759
religion he says would be a revolution

1618
00:58:35,599 --> 00:58:39,599
and alan watts comes along and says that

1619
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,040
there's there's nothing more

1620
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,039
um

1621
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,599
dangerous to authority than a popular

1622
00:58:43,039 --> 00:58:48,000
outbreak of mysticism but i think

1623
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,760
this is what huxley was pointing to and

1624
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:52,159
he talks about religion in these terms

1625
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:54,640
about being less about symbols and

1626
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:55,920
returning to a sense of experience and

1627
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:58,639
intuition

1628
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,000
and huxley says that he envisions a

1629
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:02,879
religion

1630
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,798
which gives rise to everyday mysticism

1631
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,920
and he talks about something that would

1632
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:11,199
undergird everyday rationality everyday

1633
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:13,599
tasks and duties and everyday human

1634
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,279
relationships in other words religion

1635
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:16,400
has to mean something

1636
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,160
and these

1637
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:20,880
these altered states of awareness that

1638
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:23,039
we seem to be able to produce

1639
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:25,760
quite easily inside the lab at hopkins

1640
00:59:23,039 --> 00:59:28,239
nyu and elsewhere with psilocybin

1641
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:31,200
i i think this is kind of

1642
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:33,598
part of huxley's prediction about a time

1643
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:36,239
when we would have legal access safe

1644
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:38,880
access efficacious access to this

1645
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,798
material that would allow for

1646
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,599
insight in an afternoon and what do you

1647
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:44,079
do

1648
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:47,440
when millions of people can become

1649
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:51,039
mystics in an afternoon

1650
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,559
so um psychedelics psilocybin

1651
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:54,719
might be so the

1652
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,760
the practical way of having these kinds

1653
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:57,279
of

1654
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,640
maybe could be termed religious

1655
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,559
experiences

1656
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:03,358
and then many people partaking in those

1657
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,798
experiences and then like evolving this

1658
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:06,159
collective intelligence thing we got

1659
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:08,318
going on

1660
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:09,519
that's the that's sort of the practice

1661
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,639
of religion that we should be looking

1662
01:00:09,519 --> 01:00:15,039
striving for as opposed to kind of um

1663
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,719
operating in the space of ideas actually

1664
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:19,838
practicing it

1665
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:23,199
um you you mentioned

1666
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:25,440
and that's the religion with no name

1667
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:27,118
the use of these tools

1668
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,000
is there a simple way to summarize

1669
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,318
religion for our previous discussion

1670
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,358
about god basically discovering the god

1671
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:35,199
inside

1672
01:00:33,358 --> 01:00:36,798
what if i give you a very complicated

1673
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:39,679
definition of religion and then we talk

1674
01:00:36,798 --> 01:00:41,838
about a more simplified

1675
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,118
let's do it so the the most complicated

1676
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:45,199
we can get on this is is the

1677
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:47,760
anthropologist clifford geertz but i

1678
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:49,439
think it's worth defining our terms um

1679
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:51,440
when we're talking about god and

1680
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:54,240
religion so religion religio from the

1681
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,760
latin means to bind back so to bind us

1682
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:57,919
back to some meaningful tradition to

1683
01:00:55,760 --> 01:01:00,720
bind us back to the source

1684
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:03,039
here's a mouthful from clifford geertz

1685
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,318
you know religion he defines as a set of

1686
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:06,239
symbols

1687
01:01:04,318 --> 01:01:08,558
which acts to establish powerful

1688
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:11,439
pervasive and long-lasting moods and

1689
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:13,200
motivations by formulating conceptions

1690
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:15,200
of a general order of existence and

1691
01:01:13,199 --> 01:01:18,558
clothing those conceptions in such an

1692
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:22,558
aura of factuality that those moods and

1693
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:25,119
motivations seem uniquely realistic

1694
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:27,280
which is complex what does that mean

1695
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,240
that religion has to make you feel

1696
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,400
something

1697
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:31,759
these moods and motivations

1698
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:34,480
but it can't just do that in the way

1699
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:37,599
that sex does that for us or or sports

1700
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:40,240
or ultimate fighting or the world cup

1701
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,880
or going to a concert so we get all that

1702
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:45,199
emotion in these experiences like that

1703
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,680
but that emotion has to be concomitant

1704
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:49,118
to a deep existential insight that

1705
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:51,199
answers this question for you in the

1706
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:53,599
morning i know why i'm here

1707
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:55,519
i know why humans are here i think i

1708
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:58,000
know what the meaning of life is that's

1709
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:00,239
what religion is and if you find that

1710
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,000
meaning in science then that's your

1711
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,000
religion and that's fine

1712
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,039
but we need to be more honest about that

1713
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,639
if if you're epistemological model is

1714
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,640
weighing facts and figures and you think

1715
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,639
that's why you're here on this planet

1716
01:02:10,639 --> 01:02:14,318
and you find deep meaning that's okay

1717
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:17,199
religion is the thing that makes you

1718
01:02:14,318 --> 01:02:20,159
feel right it has the aura of factuality

1719
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:22,159
it just makes you feel like you know the

1720
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,759
point behind existence

1721
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:25,440
in other words i think it comes down to

1722
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,200
experience like joe campbell was talking

1723
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,440
about like alice huxley mentions about

1724
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:32,159
experience and intuition i think this is

1725
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:34,480
how we connect to god

1726
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:36,558
make you feel like you understand

1727
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:39,440
the world i mean so that's that's kind

1728
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:42,720
of bigger than science that includes

1729
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:45,039
science but it's bigger do you think

1730
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:46,399
what is real

1731
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,640
like uh

1732
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,480
do you think there's an absolute reality

1733
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:53,358
that we're kind of striving towards

1734
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,199
understanding or is it all just conjured

1735
01:02:53,358 --> 01:02:59,279
up in our minds and that's the whole

1736
01:02:55,199 --> 01:03:01,598
kind of point we together create these

1737
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:03,119
realities and play with them

1738
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:05,280
and dance

1739
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:08,720
uh to to somehow derive meaning from

1740
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,839
those realities and it's ultimately not

1741
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:11,118
like

1742
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:13,599
very

1743
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:17,039
deeply integrated into what's like um

1744
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:20,160
into atoms of space time

1745
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:22,640
another easy question lex

1746
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:25,279
well i mean you have to kind of

1747
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:26,798
when you're thinking about

1748
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,559
emotion and

1749
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:30,639
making it concrete

1750
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:33,359
into something that feels real

1751
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:34,318
you have to start asking like what is

1752
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:36,960
real

1753
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:39,519
it's uh it's something that

1754
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,240
you know ben shapiro has the saying of

1755
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:44,559
facts don't care about your feelings

1756
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:46,239
i was always uncomfortable with this

1757
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,680
with us i mean he's just being spiffy

1758
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,679
whatever but

1759
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:50,960
uh i was always uncomfortable with

1760
01:03:49,679 --> 01:03:53,358
somehow

1761
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:55,199
first that the hubris of thinking that

1762
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:56,318
humans can

1763
01:03:55,199 --> 01:04:00,078
have

1764
01:03:56,318 --> 01:04:02,000
like arrive at uh absolute truth what he

1765
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:03,119
means which is what i assume he means by

1766
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,119
facts

1767
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,079
like things that are uncontrovertible

1768
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:08,880
and then

1769
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:11,280
somehow deriding feelings like feelings

1770
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,798
are not important to me like

1771
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,319
the whole thing

1772
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:15,358
is reality

1773
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:18,400
the

1774
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:20,159
facts don't even like facts is reality

1775
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:22,480
feelings are reality

1776
01:04:20,159 --> 01:04:23,759
like the entirety of human experience is

1777
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,440
reality

1778
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:27,839
all these consciousnesses somehow

1779
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:29,679
interacting together make up making up

1780
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:31,119
random crap and together agreeing

1781
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:32,239
they're all going to wear the same

1782
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:33,760
colors

1783
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:36,318
rooting for one football team or the

1784
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,799
other football team or countries all

1785
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:41,038
those things that's re that's real

1786
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:42,239
because we've agreed that it's real in

1787
01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,079
the same way

1788
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,399
and gives us meaning in that same way

1789
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,839
religion is a set of ideas that

1790
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,720
gives us meaning

1791
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:49,519
but

1792
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:51,118
you know

1793
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:53,519
real

1794
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:56,480
it it's really a difficult

1795
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:58,559
for uh for me as a scientist

1796
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,880
that finds comfort

1797
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:03,200
in the physical understanding of the

1798
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:05,680
universe of physics you know i love

1799
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:07,358
physics i love computer science

1800
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:08,960
it makes me feel

1801
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:10,318
like everything is perfectly

1802
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:12,960
understandable

1803
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:15,119
and then i look at humans

1804
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,119
they're totally not understandable it's

1805
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:19,358
like a giant mess but that's part of the

1806
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:21,599
beauty like what is love

1807
01:05:19,358 --> 01:05:25,920
like what the hell is love

1808
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:27,920
it's certainly not a like a weird uh

1809
01:05:25,920 --> 01:05:30,159
hack to convince me to procreate because

1810
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,920
it feels something bigger than that

1811
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,480
so like taking a purely evolutionary

1812
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:36,559
biologist's perspective is missing the

1813
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:39,039
uh it's not missing it's only capturing

1814
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:41,280
a part of the picture and so it just

1815
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,920
keeps making me ask like

1816
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,760
what is real because i as a human it's

1817
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,798
very human-centric it does certainly

1818
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,799
feel like uh

1819
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,590
a part a big part of what is real is all

1820
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:58,318
the fake stuff my mind makes up

1821
01:05:53,590 --> 01:06:00,400
[Laughter]

1822
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:03,679
i mean okay i guess

1823
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:05,760
is there something you could say

1824
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:08,399
from our discussions about

1825
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,559
the tools of psychedelics about our

1826
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:12,400
discussion about religion

1827
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:14,720
of what is real

1828
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:18,318
of what is reality

1829
01:06:14,719 --> 01:06:19,838
these are largely unanswerable questions

1830
01:06:18,318 --> 01:06:21,119
but we should nevertheless strive to

1831
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:23,519
answer them that's the whole point of

1832
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,440
the human experience and i think science

1833
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:27,038
is one way and religion is another and i

1834
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,798
think there's actually a sphere where

1835
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,039
they intersect you know

1836
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:33,119
there's a way for religion to be

1837
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,880
observable testable repeatable

1838
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,240
falsifiable when i look at the ancient

1839
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,920
mysteries that that's what i find i

1840
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:39,358
think i find people

1841
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:41,119
exploring

1842
01:06:39,358 --> 01:06:43,358
alternate states of consciousness and

1843
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:44,640
arriving at conclusions based on that

1844
01:06:43,358 --> 01:06:46,400
exploration

1845
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:48,159
and deriving deep meaning from that

1846
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:50,559
which yes are feelings and emotions and

1847
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:51,759
very hard to quantify but nonetheless

1848
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:53,039
these are the things that govern our

1849
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,400
lives i mean

1850
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,559
i don't know a parent who isn't

1851
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:59,440
motivated by their by the love of their

1852
01:06:56,559 --> 01:07:01,599
children um everything i do

1853
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,159
at 40 years old now is pretty much

1854
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:05,680
inspired by my love for my two daughters

1855
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:07,759
and i can't prove to you that i love

1856
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,759
them i can say it i can show you

1857
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:11,839
behavior but it's very hard for me to

1858
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:13,280
weigh and measure that so

1859
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:16,400
not everything

1860
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:20,480
um is so reducible to this quantifiable

1861
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:22,639
reality and yet i also love science and

1862
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,400
and i love the historical process of

1863
01:07:22,639 --> 01:07:28,000
weighing this data i love the chemistry

1864
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,358
i love the biology um and and for me um

1865
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,960
i think this was the message of the

1866
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:32,318
ancient greeks

1867
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,880
and i think this is the world in which

1868
01:07:32,318 --> 01:07:36,639
paleochristianity was born i think there

1869
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:39,599
is this this meeting ground between

1870
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:43,519
science and religion um uh

1871
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,720
which allow for the if not the discovery

1872
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:45,599
then at least

1873
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:48,000
the

1874
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:50,240
the near identification of the ultimate

1875
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,480
reality which is another way to describe

1876
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:54,239
god right this being a being is the

1877
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,880
transcendent mystery

1878
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:59,279
so speaking of god you mentioned to me

1879
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:02,000
offline you're wearing uh the most

1880
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:05,200
sophisticated clothing choice

1881
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,639
um of the elite intellectuals uh like

1882
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:08,399
you mentioned sam harris was wearing a

1883
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:09,920
hoodie this is the sam harris hoodie

1884
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:12,240
he's starting a trend he's starting a

1885
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,920
trend

1886
01:08:12,239 --> 01:08:16,719
um this is a new religion you could even

1887
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:18,960
say it's a ritual it's a ritual practice

1888
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:19,920
of uh intellectuals of searching for

1889
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:22,319
meaning

1890
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:25,838
uh so there's there's a quite a

1891
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:26,798
fascinating debate so he was for a time

1892
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:29,198
still

1893
01:08:26,798 --> 01:08:30,399
um known as one of the sort of new age

1894
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,158
atheists

1895
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:34,158
so he was kind of trying to explore the

1896
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:36,639
role of religion society

1897
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:38,798
and the role of science and on the other

1898
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:41,679
side another kind of powerhouse

1899
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:44,479
intellectual is jordan peterson

1900
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:47,119
who in um sometimes

1901
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:50,479
for my taste a bit too poetic of ways is

1902
01:08:47,119 --> 01:08:52,640
exploring ideas of religion

1903
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:54,639
and they had these interesting debates

1904
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:57,199
that i think will continue about the

1905
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:59,520
role of religion and society

1906
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:01,599
for uh uh for jordan there's all these

1907
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:03,600
flaws with religion

1908
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:04,640
but

1909
01:09:03,600 --> 01:09:08,640
there is

1910
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:11,359
a lot of value to be discovered amidst

1911
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,600
the the rituals the traditions the

1912
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:16,079
practice the way we conceive of each

1913
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:19,600
other because of the ideas that religion

1914
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:22,399
propagates and then for sam

1915
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:25,199
it says that everything about religion

1916
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:28,158
is uh basically gets in the way

1917
01:09:25,198 --> 01:09:31,678
of us fully realizing our human

1918
01:09:28,158 --> 01:09:34,719
potential which is deeply scientific and

1919
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:38,798
rational and um

1920
01:09:34,719 --> 01:09:41,920
sort of like we're surrounded by mystery

1921
01:09:38,798 --> 01:09:44,560
calling that mystery god is getting in

1922
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:46,399
the way of us understanding that mystery

1923
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:50,000
what do you think about this debate

1924
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:51,679
about the role of religion and society

1925
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:53,119
we should continue having this debate i

1926
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:54,719
talked to jordan a couple weeks ago as a

1927
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:56,719
matter of fact excellent and and his

1928
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:57,600
podcast is public excellent it'll be out

1929
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:58,560
soon

1930
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,159
and so

1931
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:02,400
you know he and i

1932
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:04,158
how did that go by the way um it was it

1933
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:05,839
was incredible uh carl rock the

1934
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:07,599
professor joined us as a matter of fact

1935
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:10,239
for one of his rare public appearances

1936
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:12,719
so beautiful we went we went deep um and

1937
01:10:10,238 --> 01:10:14,238
jordan is very well read obviously on

1938
01:10:12,719 --> 01:10:16,960
the psychedelic literature he had just

1939
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:19,039
had um roland griffiths from hopkins on

1940
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,880
the podcast and it's one of roland's

1941
01:10:19,039 --> 01:10:23,279
figures that jordan and i again just

1942
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:25,359
like the the language of aldous huxley

1943
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:26,479
it's hard to move past the following

1944
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:28,238
statistic

1945
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:30,399
over the past 20 years

1946
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:32,399
of the modern study of psilocybin

1947
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:35,039
roland will tell you that about three

1948
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:37,519
and four of their volunteers walk away

1949
01:10:35,039 --> 01:10:39,920
from their single dose of psilocybin

1950
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:42,560
high dose saying it was among the most

1951
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:44,880
meaningful experiences of their entire

1952
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:47,360
lives if not the most meaningful and

1953
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:51,119
jordan says like how do you

1954
01:10:47,359 --> 01:10:55,039
what do you do with that um uh how do we

1955
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:56,399
i mean how do we synthesize that um

1956
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,960
you know here we are

1957
01:10:56,399 --> 01:11:01,920
quantifying the the qualifiable the

1958
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:04,000
unqualifiable and and yet these these

1959
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:06,399
compounds have dramatic effects on

1960
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:08,479
people's lives and they walk away

1961
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:11,279
feeling like they're more

1962
01:11:08,479 --> 01:11:14,399
loving more compassionate um the science

1963
01:11:11,279 --> 01:11:16,960
of all talks about um the the welling up

1964
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:19,359
of cooperation and resource sharing and

1965
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,439
kindness and all these strange things

1966
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:24,399
from this single chemical intervention

1967
01:11:21,439 --> 01:11:27,359
which seems to reduce us to automata as

1968
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:28,799
if enlightenment can be flipped on uh

1969
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:30,399
like a switch and yet there it is

1970
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:31,840
there's the data and i don't see how you

1971
01:11:30,399 --> 01:11:35,198
walk away from that i mean i i

1972
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:36,960
completely understand sam's position

1973
01:11:35,198 --> 01:11:40,000
but i think there's there's a reading of

1974
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,760
religion particularly the mystical core

1975
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:44,079
of of the big faiths and especially

1976
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:45,679
these ancient mystery cults which do

1977
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:48,960
speak again to those moods and

1978
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:52,158
motivations um creating this aura of

1979
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:54,719
factuality that these volunteers never

1980
01:11:52,158 --> 01:11:56,799
walk away from permanently transformed

1981
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:58,800
just like the ancient mysteries and part

1982
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:03,199
of that is perhaps language that we need

1983
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:03,199
to continue to evolve language in

1984
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:09,360
in how we conceive of these processes

1985
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:10,880
maybe religion has a bunch of baggage

1986
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:14,158
associated with it

1987
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:16,560
that uh is good to let go of

1988
01:12:14,158 --> 01:12:18,559
or perhaps not i don't know it did

1989
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,000
this connected to our previous

1990
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:21,520
part of our conversation is the

1991
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,960
importance of language in this whole

1992
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:24,560
thing well that's how i start my book

1993
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,560
with one of these volunteers from the

1994
01:12:24,560 --> 01:12:29,280
nyu psilocybin experiments this this

1995
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,679
woman at dinah bazer who's an atheist

1996
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:34,000
and she still describes herself as an

1997
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,158
atheist and yet as one of these three

1998
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:38,479
and four people who walked away from

1999
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:40,559
this experiment transformed she says

2000
01:12:38,479 --> 01:12:43,198
that her experience of psilocybin was

2001
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:45,360
like being bathed in god's love from an

2002
01:12:43,198 --> 01:12:47,279
atheist yes and i asked her why she uses

2003
01:12:45,359 --> 01:12:50,880
the word god why not the love of the

2004
01:12:47,279 --> 01:12:52,719
cosmos or the universe or mother nature

2005
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:54,159
and she says well frankly you know we

2006
01:12:52,719 --> 01:12:56,719
don't know about any of this stuff and

2007
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:58,079
that god makes sense to me um she's

2008
01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:00,399
still an atheist

2009
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:01,760
um but it's the way she describes that

2010
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:03,839
as kind of like

2011
01:13:01,760 --> 01:13:05,600
the way your mother's love must have

2012
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:07,279
felt when you were a baby

2013
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,120
yeah there's a there's a kind of i like

2014
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:11,439
the way einstein uses god god doesn't

2015
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:12,960
play dice there's a poetry there's a

2016
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,599
humility that you don't know what the

2017
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,679
hell is going on there's a humor to it

2018
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,640
i'm a huge fan especially like more and

2019
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:20,399
more

2020
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:22,800
of just kind of

2021
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:23,839
having a big old laugh at the absurdity

2022
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,000
of

2023
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:28,400
this world and this life

2024
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:29,920
as uh represented nicely by memes on

2025
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:32,399
twitter kind of thing

2026
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,560
i mean there's a there's a sense in

2027
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,799
which we want to be playing with these

2028
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:38,719
words and not take them so

2029
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,000
seriously and being a little bit

2030
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:41,359
light-hearted

2031
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:42,560
and explore

2032
01:13:41,359 --> 01:13:44,559
uh let me ask you about because you

2033
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:47,920
mentioned and nyu

2034
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:49,920
um what i find fascinating is how much

2035
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:52,480
amazing researchers

2036
01:13:49,920 --> 01:13:55,440
speaking of science right uh

2037
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:56,639
studying the effects of psilocybin

2038
01:13:55,439 --> 01:13:59,678
studying the effects of various

2039
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:02,159
psychedelics mdma on the human mind

2040
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:04,960
right now for helping people but i'm i'm

2041
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:07,439
hoping there'll be studies uh soon

2042
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:09,039
at hopkins and elsewhere that allow

2043
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:11,359
people that are kind of more

2044
01:14:09,039 --> 01:14:13,119
quote-unquote creatives or

2045
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:15,439
regular people that don't have a

2046
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,640
particular demon they're trying to work

2047
01:14:15,439 --> 01:14:18,399
through the

2048
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,119
a problem they're trying to work through

2049
01:14:18,399 --> 01:14:21,920
but

2050
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:24,559
more like to see what can i

2051
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:26,319
find if i utilize psychedelics to

2052
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:28,480
explore is there something you could say

2053
01:14:26,319 --> 01:14:29,519
that is exciting to you it's promising

2054
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:32,158
about

2055
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:33,760
the future what currently is going on

2056
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:35,839
but also the future of psychedelics

2057
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:38,000
research yeah hopkins and elsewhere the

2058
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:39,279
healthy normals the healthy norms

2059
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,520
i was looking for the right words

2060
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:43,359
because normal doesn't feel healthy

2061
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:44,880
doesn't feel like a good term and normal

2062
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,719
doesn't feel like a good term because

2063
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:49,119
we're all pretty messed up and we're all

2064
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:50,880
weird so well those with ontological

2065
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:52,960
angst in that case

2066
01:14:50,880 --> 01:14:55,440
great maybe that'll be a future dsm

2067
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:58,239
qualification yeah um there's no doubt

2068
01:14:55,439 --> 01:15:00,399
that that things like psilocybe and mdma

2069
01:14:58,238 --> 01:15:02,879
are are useful for things like anxiety

2070
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:05,359
depression end-of-life distress ptsd

2071
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:07,119
alcoholism you name it um

2072
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:09,519
and it's largely because of the clinical

2073
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:12,640
research that mdma and psilocybin will

2074
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:15,280
probably be legal in some fda regulated

2075
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,199
way in the next five years um but i mean

2076
01:15:15,279 --> 01:15:19,039
again i start the first page of my book

2077
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:20,719
with this question why why do

2078
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:23,119
psychedelics work

2079
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:26,239
across all these different conditions

2080
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:29,599
and uh the best that i could find is is

2081
01:15:26,238 --> 01:15:32,000
the meaning right um tony bossus at nyu

2082
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,000
talks about psilocybin for example as

2083
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,520
meaning making medicine

2084
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:37,679
which is interesting because it puts it

2085
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:40,480
somewhere between a therapeutic and

2086
01:15:37,679 --> 01:15:41,679
again this this ontological

2087
01:15:40,479 --> 01:15:43,198
instigator

2088
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:44,319
what is it about psychedelics that

2089
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:46,799
creates

2090
01:15:44,319 --> 01:15:48,479
these mystical experiences or mystical

2091
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,640
like experiences you can call them

2092
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:52,479
emotional breakthroughs you can call

2093
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:54,000
them moments of all

2094
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:55,439
i do think we get locked up in the

2095
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:57,920
language and we're somewhere between

2096
01:15:55,439 --> 01:16:00,799
science and religion here um including

2097
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:03,119
legally so the fda is one route to this

2098
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:04,400
what excites me about psychedelics is

2099
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:06,399
the first amendment what is this going

2100
01:16:04,399 --> 01:16:08,079
to mean for religion the freedom of

2101
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:10,079
religion being the first thing that's

2102
01:16:08,079 --> 01:16:11,840
mentioned in the first amendment before

2103
01:16:10,079 --> 01:16:13,679
freedom of speech freedom of assembly oh

2104
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:16,239
interesting yeah if america is known for

2105
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:18,560
anything it's it's a refuge for uh

2106
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,919
religious pioneers and so we already

2107
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,400
have the native american church

2108
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,560
brazilian spawn churches that are using

2109
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,238
psychedelics but what would happen if

2110
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:30,080
judaism or christianity or islam were to

2111
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:33,119
begin incorporating

2112
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:36,079
the very ritual very sacred

2113
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:38,319
and discreet use of psychedelics as part

2114
01:16:36,079 --> 01:16:39,600
of their liturgy so not replacing the

2115
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:43,279
sunday eucharist in the case of

2116
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:46,239
christianity but um part of the extra uh

2117
01:16:43,279 --> 01:16:48,158
extra credit dimension of the faith

2118
01:16:46,238 --> 01:16:50,079
and then we can through practice figure

2119
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:52,238
out how essential it is it could be a

2120
01:16:50,079 --> 01:16:53,600
minor thing it could be a major thing

2121
01:16:52,238 --> 01:16:56,079
that's another thing i wanted to kind of

2122
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:57,520
ask you is um i recently despite the

2123
01:16:56,079 --> 01:16:59,279
fact that i'm eating a huge amount of

2124
01:16:57,520 --> 01:17:01,840
meat i'm getting fat

2125
01:16:59,279 --> 01:17:03,119
i'm loving it i'm you know this is

2126
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,679
actually

2127
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:08,158
uh as of two days ago i started this

2128
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:10,158
long road to training for david goggins

2129
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,479
to training back to uh to getting back

2130
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:15,039
to competing in jiu jitsu so

2131
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:17,519
the fun is over but i also partake in

2132
01:17:15,039 --> 01:17:19,119
fasting and there was a very

2133
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:21,120
strong

2134
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:23,519
there's an almost like a

2135
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:25,119
hallucinogenic aspect of fasting because

2136
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:28,080
it was especially because it was a 72

2137
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:30,640
hour fast versus a more common fast that

2138
01:17:28,079 --> 01:17:32,238
i do which is 24 hours

2139
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:34,159
you know

2140
01:17:32,238 --> 01:17:35,519
and a bunch of people talk about

2141
01:17:34,158 --> 01:17:39,439
throughout history about the value of

2142
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:39,440
fasting in having these kind of

2143
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:42,400
visual these kind of intellectual

2144
01:17:41,039 --> 01:17:44,479
experiences

2145
01:17:42,399 --> 01:17:47,679
also there's meditation sam harris with

2146
01:17:44,479 --> 01:17:49,439
the hoodie uh do do you have a sense

2147
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:50,960
that um

2148
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:54,079
those other

2149
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:56,079
rituals of fasting of meditation and

2150
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:58,559
maybe other things

2151
01:17:56,079 --> 01:18:01,039
could uh could be as essential or more

2152
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,719
essential to the religious experience as

2153
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:04,158
psychedelics

2154
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,359
yes if not

2155
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:08,158
and this is going to sound weird but

2156
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:10,719
maybe not if more so um i look at

2157
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:12,559
psychedelics as a catalyst

2158
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:14,880
for spiritual investigation

2159
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:18,000
not as the superficial means to an end

2160
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:20,480
um i i think their their value

2161
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:24,960
is in kind of um serving as a google

2162
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:24,959
maps for the kingdom of heaven um

2163
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:29,599
all right i like this

2164
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,600
well so rom das teacher said that when

2165
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:34,400
when he was was offered psychedelics

2166
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:37,760
that um it'll it'll get you in the room

2167
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:39,359
with jesus but it won't keep you there

2168
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,400
okay yeah and i think that's all well

2169
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,759
and good but what if you don't know

2170
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:43,839
where the house is in the first place

2171
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,400
what if you've never had a mystical

2172
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,800
experience what if what if religion

2173
01:18:46,399 --> 01:18:50,399
is anathema to you what if you hate god

2174
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,480
what if all these words mean nothing to

2175
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:54,639
you and they probably do for many many

2176
01:18:52,479 --> 01:18:56,158
people and it's perfectly understandable

2177
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,560
i think that we've we've lost the

2178
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:00,479
coordinates to these irrational states

2179
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,719
again that were prized throughout

2180
01:19:00,479 --> 01:19:05,119
antiquity and that continued to be

2181
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:06,560
prized by the mystical communities even

2182
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:08,960
in big organized religion it just

2183
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:11,760
doesn't filter out that much and so

2184
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:13,520
psychedelics in my mind

2185
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:16,560
help orient

2186
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:18,239
our minds bodies and souls towards the

2187
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:21,760
irrational right we talked about

2188
01:19:18,238 --> 01:19:24,079
mckenna's invisible world that seems to

2189
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:26,800
have this symbiosis with our own and

2190
01:19:24,079 --> 01:19:28,079
perhaps has this higher intent for us um

2191
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,159
you could very well

2192
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:32,479
just you know take catalog of your

2193
01:19:30,158 --> 01:19:34,960
dreams right and that would do it too

2194
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:38,399
but psychedelics seem to be particularly

2195
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,880
fast acting um particularly potent and

2196
01:19:38,399 --> 01:19:43,119
very reliable especially in the clinical

2197
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:45,199
studies and so i looked at them as as

2198
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:47,119
biochemical discoveries like like huxley

2199
01:19:45,198 --> 01:19:50,399
did maybe it's once

2200
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:52,479
in your life or infrequently right but

2201
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:55,519
maybe that's the beginning of a genuine

2202
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:57,359
introspection and a life well examined

2203
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:59,120
as the ancients always instructed us

2204
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:00,079
yeah it does seem like in the research

2205
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:02,479
that's

2206
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:05,519
the effect of psychedelics always comes

2207
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:08,238
with the integration where you

2208
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:10,719
use it just like you said as a catalyst

2209
01:20:08,238 --> 01:20:12,638
for thinking through stuff it's not it's

2210
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:15,359
not going to be

2211
01:20:12,639 --> 01:20:17,199
i don't even know if google maps

2212
01:20:15,359 --> 01:20:19,198
oh maybe maybe google maps is the right

2213
01:20:17,198 --> 01:20:20,879
analogy but it doesn't do the driving

2214
01:20:19,198 --> 01:20:23,198
for you

2215
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:25,679
you still have to do the driving uh it

2216
01:20:23,198 --> 01:20:28,158
just kind of gives you the directions

2217
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:31,359
uh so after you come come down from the

2218
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:32,719
trip or whatever you still have to drive

2219
01:20:31,359 --> 01:20:33,920
there's other tools that are kind of

2220
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:35,359
interesting we've been talking about

2221
01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:37,440
this um

2222
01:20:35,359 --> 01:20:39,599
at the psychological level but there's

2223
01:20:37,439 --> 01:20:41,599
also a neuroscience perspective if we

2224
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:44,079
kind of like go past the skull into the

2225
01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:46,400
brain with the neurons firing there's

2226
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:47,359
ideas of brain computer interfaces first

2227
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:49,119
of all there's a whole field of

2228
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:51,039
neuroscience that's kind of zooming in

2229
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:53,198
and studying the firing of the brain the

2230
01:20:51,039 --> 01:20:56,238
firing of the neurons in the brain

2231
01:20:53,198 --> 01:20:58,960
of how from those

2232
01:20:56,238 --> 01:21:00,238
neurons emerges all the things that we

2233
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,760
think that make us human that's a

2234
01:21:00,238 --> 01:21:02,879
fascinating exploration in the human

2235
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,560
mind

2236
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,400
that that's of course where the

2237
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:09,120
psychedelics have the chemical the

2238
01:21:06,399 --> 01:21:11,119
biochemical effects on on those

2239
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:12,719
neurons

2240
01:21:11,119 --> 01:21:14,639
there's ideas of brain computer

2241
01:21:12,719 --> 01:21:16,000
interfaces which

2242
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,920
you know if you look at especially what

2243
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,880
neural link is doing with this long-term

2244
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:22,239
vision

2245
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:25,039
with elon musk and your link they uh

2246
01:21:22,238 --> 01:21:29,559
they hope to expand

2247
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:29,560
well he calls it a wizard hat

2248
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:33,440
[Laughter]

2249
01:21:32,158 --> 01:21:35,198
this is back to the humor on the

2250
01:21:33,439 --> 01:21:36,479
internet thing uh

2251
01:21:35,198 --> 01:21:38,960
the the

2252
01:21:36,479 --> 01:21:40,879
the wizard hat that expands the

2253
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:43,520
capabilities the capacity of the human

2254
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:44,639
mind do you think there's something

2255
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:46,880
there

2256
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,880
or

2257
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:52,239
is is the human mind so infinitely

2258
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:55,359
complex that

2259
01:21:52,238 --> 01:21:57,439
we're quite a long way away from

2260
01:21:55,359 --> 01:21:58,639
expanding the capabilities of the human

2261
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,279
mind

2262
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:03,520
uh through technology versus something

2263
01:22:01,279 --> 01:22:04,960
like psychedelics

2264
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:07,520
i wonder how terence mckenna would

2265
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:09,600
answer that question um no he looked to

2266
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:12,480
shamans as kind of the

2267
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,880
the scientists um the high magicians of

2268
01:22:12,479 --> 01:22:16,718
the high archaic past and the far-flung

2269
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:18,079
future

2270
01:22:16,719 --> 01:22:19,760
i'm not going to discount you know more

2271
01:22:18,079 --> 01:22:20,960
about ai than i do so i'm not going to

2272
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,000
discount it

2273
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:25,920
but

2274
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:27,119
i do think that ai paired with

2275
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,480
um

2276
01:22:27,119 --> 01:22:31,840
the sacred recovery right um the

2277
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:34,479
archaeology

2278
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:36,319
of consciousness um and these and these

2279
01:22:34,479 --> 01:22:38,399
states these archaic techniques of

2280
01:22:36,319 --> 01:22:39,759
ecstasy that were practiced across time

2281
01:22:38,399 --> 01:22:42,238
i think that's

2282
01:22:39,760 --> 01:22:44,320
a winning combination um you know part

2283
01:22:42,238 --> 01:22:46,079
of what i do in the book is just

2284
01:22:44,319 --> 01:22:47,119
i try and lay out the sentence setting

2285
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:48,639
that's often talked about with

2286
01:22:47,119 --> 01:22:50,399
psychedelics i mean so

2287
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:52,239
maybe psychedelics in the right ai

2288
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:54,238
environment is going to work i think

2289
01:22:52,238 --> 01:22:56,319
it'd probably work a lot better

2290
01:22:54,238 --> 01:22:59,439
with that myth and ritual incorporated

2291
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:00,559
so the reason ellucis worked for 2 000

2292
01:22:59,439 --> 01:23:02,319
years

2293
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:04,560
and let's assume the psychedelic

2294
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:06,319
hypothesis has some merit to it

2295
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,800
but i think the reason it worked is

2296
01:23:06,319 --> 01:23:11,439
because you were born into a mythology

2297
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:12,800
you were born into a story about demeter

2298
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:15,279
and persephone and you waited your

2299
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:17,199
entire life to meet them

2300
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:18,840
in the flesh so you weren't just

2301
01:23:17,198 --> 01:23:22,719
preparing for a few months it was a

2302
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:24,639
lifetime of expectation anticipation

2303
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:26,399
ritual preparation

2304
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:28,719
in fact some of the early church fathers

2305
01:23:26,399 --> 01:23:30,960
made fun of the greeks for essentially

2306
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:32,880
just peaking people's curiosity and

2307
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:34,399
revving up the anticipation which has

2308
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,079
something to do with the outcome by the

2309
01:23:34,399 --> 01:23:37,920
way but in other words i think we need

2310
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,760
to create a new mythology

2311
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:41,920
around this i don't think you you pop

2312
01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:44,719
into a laboratory i don't think you pop

2313
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:46,480
into a retreat center um from one day to

2314
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:48,719
the next i think that in my own case i

2315
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:51,119
feel like i've been preparing 12 years

2316
01:23:48,719 --> 01:23:52,880
for psychedelics and i'm still preparing

2317
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:54,319
including in today's conversation i'm

2318
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:56,960
learning new things

2319
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:58,799
and uh i'm willing to explore it you

2320
01:23:56,960 --> 01:24:02,000
know together with the computer

2321
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:04,880
interface but i i but i do think ritual

2322
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:07,119
is a is a gigantic part of this and even

2323
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,520
mckenna would say that um i'll

2324
01:24:07,119 --> 01:24:11,198
paraphrase him by saying that if if

2325
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:14,080
you'd met someone who didn't know where

2326
01:24:11,198 --> 01:24:16,479
they were between the years 1995 and

2327
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:19,039
2005 you would describe them

2328
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:20,559
as a fairly damaged person and yet who

2329
01:24:19,039 --> 01:24:22,639
among us knows what was happening in

2330
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:26,159
western civilization between 900 and

2331
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:27,520
1300 let alone 2500 years ago so this is

2332
01:24:26,158 --> 01:24:29,198
in many ways the prophet of the

2333
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,760
psychedelic renaissance saying that

2334
01:24:29,198 --> 01:24:33,119
history has lessons

2335
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:35,600
and i don't think they're superficial

2336
01:24:33,119 --> 01:24:37,279
lessons i think it cuts to the very core

2337
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:41,199
of how and why

2338
01:24:37,279 --> 01:24:43,439
western civilization came to be born

2339
01:24:41,198 --> 01:24:47,678
yeah but that history can be loaded into

2340
01:24:43,439 --> 01:24:49,198
ai systems and i do love the idea of

2341
01:24:47,679 --> 01:24:52,239
whether it's to bring computer

2342
01:24:49,198 --> 01:24:54,799
interfaces or without

2343
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:56,238
intrusive sort of without direct reading

2344
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:59,360
of the neurons and more sort of

2345
01:24:56,238 --> 01:25:01,519
interactive experience of the robot

2346
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:04,158
that you can have an ai system that

2347
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:06,320
steers your psychedelic experience

2348
01:25:04,158 --> 01:25:08,079
that

2349
01:25:06,319 --> 01:25:09,759
helps you sort of

2350
01:25:08,079 --> 01:25:12,880
when you take a heroic dose of

2351
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,239
psilocybin for example help steer you

2352
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,079
steer your mind

2353
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:17,919
say just the right things i mean you

2354
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:20,238
could say that kind of thing with uh

2355
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:21,679
it's a totally open

2356
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:23,279
um

2357
01:25:21,679 --> 01:25:25,679
problem i would say

2358
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:28,479
you talk about set and setting this the

2359
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:30,239
interesting thing about

2360
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:31,599
johns hopkins is you know you create a

2361
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:33,119
comfortable environment a safe

2362
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,679
environment for

2363
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:37,359
allowing then if you take a heroic like

2364
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:39,679
a large dose

2365
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:41,599
of psilocybin that you could

2366
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:43,600
trust that everything would be safe and

2367
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:46,560
you can really allow the exploration in

2368
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:49,360
your mind but then you don't know from a

2369
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:51,600
psychotherapy perspective of like

2370
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:54,000
during that trip what a human should say

2371
01:25:51,600 --> 01:25:56,719
to steer that trip like that's a totally

2372
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,960
open set of problems and in some sense

2373
01:25:56,719 --> 01:26:00,960
probably throughout history those

2374
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,319
rituals you figured out what are the

2375
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:05,119
right things to say to each other

2376
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:06,880
exactly how to collaborate and maybe if

2377
01:26:05,119 --> 01:26:08,639
you can turn that into an optimization

2378
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,639
problem

2379
01:26:08,639 --> 01:26:12,639
ai could figure that out much much

2380
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:14,639
quicker i'm with you so ellucis was

2381
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:17,679
known for three things the legomena the

2382
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:20,400
dromina the numena the things said

2383
01:26:17,679 --> 01:26:22,560
the things done the things shown if you

2384
01:26:20,399 --> 01:26:24,158
can pack that all into your ai interface

2385
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,840
i'm in lex friedman

2386
01:26:24,158 --> 01:26:27,519
i'm going to write a proposal and and

2387
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:29,920
then try to get it through the irb at

2388
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,920
mit

2389
01:26:30,238 --> 01:26:36,158
i mean there there's a certain sense in

2390
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:38,480
which i definitely wanted to to explore

2391
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:40,319
uh psychedelics i mean

2392
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:42,399
in my personal life but also more

2393
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:45,039
rigorously as a scientist

2394
01:26:42,399 --> 01:26:49,439
and uh to to push that forward and

2395
01:26:45,039 --> 01:26:50,960
especially in the ai space and it is um

2396
01:26:49,439 --> 01:26:52,719
difficult kind of

2397
01:26:50,960 --> 01:26:55,760
how to do that dance

2398
01:26:52,719 --> 01:26:57,600
when there's uh gray areas of legality

2399
01:26:55,760 --> 01:26:59,280
and all those kinds of things and we're

2400
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:02,000
dancing around them and some of that is

2401
01:26:59,279 --> 01:27:05,439
language and some of that is uh

2402
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:08,158
what we socially uh conceive of as as

2403
01:27:05,439 --> 01:27:10,238
drugs or not and

2404
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:11,839
you're right that perhaps we can reframe

2405
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:13,519
it as religious experiences all those

2406
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,520
kinds of things i mean it's fascinating

2407
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:17,440
because it feels like there's a bunch of

2408
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:20,080
tools before us that were used by the

2409
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:22,799
ancients that we're not utilizing

2410
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:26,000
for exploring the human mind

2411
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:28,000
that we very well could be in a rigorous

2412
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,119
scientific way in a safe way and that's

2413
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,840
fascinating

2414
01:27:29,119 --> 01:27:33,359
there's this interesting

2415
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:35,279
period of uh

2416
01:27:33,359 --> 01:27:37,839
in the 20th century

2417
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:39,279
of lsd use

2418
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:41,600
that uh many of the people doing

2419
01:27:39,279 --> 01:27:44,079
research on psychedelics now kind of

2420
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:46,639
have their roots in that history i

2421
01:27:44,079 --> 01:27:48,559
mentioned that dr mcdovin

2422
01:27:46,639 --> 01:27:50,960
he is one of those people

2423
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:53,840
uh and there's this interesting story of

2424
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:57,198
a bunch of creatives that used lsd or

2425
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:58,639
other drugs to help them

2426
01:27:57,198 --> 01:28:00,559
what do you make of the idea of somebody

2427
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:02,480
like ken kizi who wrote one flew over

2428
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:04,320
the cuckoo's nest in part under the

2429
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:06,638
influence of lsd

2430
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:08,319
like what do you

2431
01:28:06,639 --> 01:28:13,600
make

2432
01:28:08,319 --> 01:28:15,599
of the use of psychedelics to uh

2433
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,159
maximize the creative potential of the

2434
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:20,079
human mind

2435
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:22,238
is this um

2436
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:24,000
is this a as a crutch or is this

2437
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:25,439
actually um

2438
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:28,880
an effective

2439
01:28:25,439 --> 01:28:31,119
tool that we should explore

2440
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:33,920
one person's crutch might be another's

2441
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:35,439
bungee cord um

2442
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:38,158
you know

2443
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:40,238
it depends on that mind

2444
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:41,839
yeah uh think about paul mccartney i

2445
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:43,599
mean we might not have some of the

2446
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,639
better beatles music in the absence of

2447
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:47,679
lsd

2448
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:49,520
and what did sir paul say in 1967 when

2449
01:28:47,679 --> 01:28:52,560
he was asked about his use of lsd he

2450
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:54,639
said that he recognized the dangers

2451
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,480
inherent in it but that

2452
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:58,719
he did it with a very specific very

2453
01:28:56,479 --> 01:29:00,718
deliberate purpose in mind um he wanted

2454
01:28:58,719 --> 01:29:02,239
to find the answer to what life is all

2455
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:04,719
about

2456
01:29:02,238 --> 01:29:06,079
and i'm not sure what sir paul is doing

2457
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:07,198
this week but he's probably not doing

2458
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:10,158
lsd

2459
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:12,719
speaking back to my theory about these

2460
01:29:10,158 --> 01:29:15,519
these substances being catalyzers of

2461
01:29:12,719 --> 01:29:16,960
spiritual introspection um

2462
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:18,880
you know it came along at a time in

2463
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:21,279
their life when i think they were right

2464
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,359
for it especially george harrison um i

2465
01:29:21,279 --> 01:29:24,559
highly recommend the martin scorsese

2466
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:27,439
documentary

2467
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:30,159
about uh about george harrison um you

2468
01:29:27,439 --> 01:29:32,399
know for for them i think it was exactly

2469
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:33,439
the way we ought to investigate it which

2470
01:29:32,399 --> 01:29:34,479
is

2471
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:36,319
uh well

2472
01:29:34,479 --> 01:29:38,638
mind expanders this is what psychedelics

2473
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:41,039
do right that which makes manifest the

2474
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:42,719
contents of the mind um

2475
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:44,560
in the absence of an experience like

2476
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:47,039
that and it can be in a three-day fast

2477
01:29:44,560 --> 01:29:49,840
it can be laying down in a cave

2478
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:51,679
it can be in ritual chanting it can be

2479
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:53,199
in a sundance but in the absence of that

2480
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:54,319
kind of experience at the right time in

2481
01:29:53,198 --> 01:29:56,879
your life

2482
01:29:54,319 --> 01:29:58,639
it may otherwise be very difficult

2483
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:00,719
to find entrance to that kingdom of

2484
01:29:58,639 --> 01:30:02,560
heaven which i do think is here and now

2485
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:05,039
getting right back to the very beginning

2486
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:06,960
if we are actually to participate in

2487
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:09,039
that eternal principle how

2488
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,319
and when

2489
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:12,880
what do you think nietzsche meant when

2490
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:15,279
he said that god is dead

2491
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:17,679
so there's a sense that religion is

2492
01:30:15,279 --> 01:30:21,198
fading from society

2493
01:30:17,679 --> 01:30:22,960
and uh there's a cranky german that kind

2494
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:24,319
of wrote about it

2495
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,158
what do you think he meant he was a

2496
01:30:24,319 --> 01:30:28,559
cranky german who knew a lot about

2497
01:30:26,158 --> 01:30:31,119
dionysus by the way

2498
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,719
which is why i like him uh so certainly

2499
01:30:31,119 --> 01:30:35,840
there's some truth

2500
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:38,000
to the mortality of god um

2501
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:39,360
i think gallup put out a study only a

2502
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,039
couple months ago where church

2503
01:30:39,359 --> 01:30:44,799
membership is now officially in the

2504
01:30:41,039 --> 01:30:46,800
minority in the united states at 47

2505
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:49,440
according to the most recent poll that

2506
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:51,119
number was closer to 70 percent only 20

2507
01:30:49,439 --> 01:30:52,879
years ago wow so we're living through

2508
01:30:51,119 --> 01:30:55,679
something and we're living through the

2509
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:57,840
unchurching of america and it's the rise

2510
01:30:55,679 --> 01:31:00,319
of the spiritual but not religious

2511
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:02,079
um you know the uh the inheritor of all

2512
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:04,479
traditions but the slave to none there's

2513
01:31:02,079 --> 01:31:06,399
a rise in the unaffiliated the nuns i

2514
01:31:04,479 --> 01:31:07,919
think it was like one-third of

2515
01:31:06,399 --> 01:31:09,679
millennials it's probably much higher

2516
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,079
now that don't affiliate with any

2517
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:14,319
religion so in that sense god is

2518
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:15,679
absolutely dead um

2519
01:31:14,319 --> 01:31:17,119
but maybe not the god that we were

2520
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:18,719
trying to define

2521
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:20,079
at the very beginning you know so

2522
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:22,719
nietzsche also looked forward to the

2523
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:24,559
ubermensch which would be a fully

2524
01:31:22,719 --> 01:31:27,359
realized human being

2525
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:28,840
that despite the death of god um did not

2526
01:31:27,359 --> 01:31:32,079
fall into

2527
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:35,119
nihilism and amorality existential

2528
01:31:32,079 --> 01:31:36,800
despair all that great german stuff

2529
01:31:35,119 --> 01:31:39,439
and there are some commentators who talk

2530
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:41,679
about this eternal recurrence that just

2531
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:43,759
maybe by incorporating

2532
01:31:41,679 --> 01:31:45,279
some of these techniques not necessarily

2533
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:47,119
doctrine and dogma but i would say the

2534
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:48,880
techniques of antiquity

2535
01:31:47,119 --> 01:31:51,920
and again nietzsche writes a lot about

2536
01:31:48,880 --> 01:31:54,480
the rationality of dionysus having its

2537
01:31:51,920 --> 01:31:56,880
place in society if if anything these

2538
01:31:54,479 --> 01:32:00,399
biochemical discoveries i think point us

2539
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:03,039
back they point us back to dionysus and

2540
01:32:00,399 --> 01:32:06,079
their responsible incorporation of the

2541
01:32:03,039 --> 01:32:10,158
irrational into our otherwise

2542
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:13,119
society of of rational um people and our

2543
01:32:10,158 --> 01:32:15,359
kazoo history i i have a sense that

2544
01:32:13,119 --> 01:32:16,960
there will be kind of just kind of as

2545
01:32:15,359 --> 01:32:19,039
you've implied

2546
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:20,960
that there will be um

2547
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:23,198
maybe the god of old is dying and

2548
01:32:20,960 --> 01:32:24,800
there'll be a rebirth of different kind

2549
01:32:23,198 --> 01:32:27,279
of god and it'll just keep happening

2550
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:29,119
throughout history i i do think

2551
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:31,279
there will be a time where ai will be

2552
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:32,800
the gods we look to

2553
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:35,359
uh the the other the the

2554
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:39,119
super-intelligent those kinds of things

2555
01:32:35,359 --> 01:32:40,639
there's a little bit of an inkling of um

2556
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:43,119
religious

2557
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:45,440
longing for meaning in the way people

2558
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:47,679
conceive of aliens currently

2559
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:50,960
i it i mean i talked to a bunch of

2560
01:32:47,679 --> 01:32:53,119
people about ufos eops and aliens and so

2561
01:32:50,960 --> 01:32:55,039
to me it's very interesting for perhaps

2562
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:57,679
different reasons because i'm just i

2563
01:32:55,039 --> 01:33:00,399
look up to the stars and it's incredibly

2564
01:32:57,679 --> 01:33:02,239
uh humbling to me to think that there's

2565
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:04,079
trillions of intelligent alien

2566
01:33:02,238 --> 01:33:05,919
civilizations out there which to me

2567
01:33:04,079 --> 01:33:07,039
seems likely or not perhaps not

2568
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:09,279
intelligent

2569
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:10,800
perhaps just alien life

2570
01:33:09,279 --> 01:33:12,880
and actually

2571
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,480
also that we don't even understand what

2572
01:33:12,880 --> 01:33:16,319
it means to be intelligent or do we

2573
01:33:14,479 --> 01:33:20,238
understand what it means to be alive the

2574
01:33:16,319 --> 01:33:20,238
time scale the spatial skill which

2575
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:27,360
patterns of atoms can form in a way that

2576
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:28,960
uh you can call life it's just could be

2577
01:33:27,359 --> 01:33:31,359
way weirder

2578
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:33,840
uh than we can imagine that's and

2579
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:37,119
certainly way different than human life

2580
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:39,679
anyway that to me is humbling and so i

2581
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:42,158
it's almost like with the simulation

2582
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:44,158
uh conceding in the world of simulation

2583
01:33:42,158 --> 01:33:45,759
thinking of aliens to me is a useful

2584
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:48,399
thought experiment of like what would

2585
01:33:45,760 --> 01:33:50,000
aliens look like if they visited how

2586
01:33:48,399 --> 01:33:53,519
would we know how would we communicate

2587
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:56,639
with them how do we send signals to them

2588
01:33:53,520 --> 01:33:58,800
uh if they're already here

2589
01:33:56,639 --> 01:34:00,000
and we don't see them how's that

2590
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:01,920
possible

2591
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:03,679
that seems to me actually likely it

2592
01:34:01,920 --> 01:34:05,679
would just be too self-centered and too

2593
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:10,079
dumb to see them if they're already here

2594
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:12,319
anyway uh but so that's kind of the

2595
01:34:10,079 --> 01:34:15,439
almost the the the pragmatic the

2596
01:34:12,319 --> 01:34:17,439
engineering the the physics

2597
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:18,960
sense of aliens but there's also kind of

2598
01:34:17,439 --> 01:34:21,839
a longing

2599
01:34:18,960 --> 01:34:23,119
to connect with other intelligent beings

2600
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,440
out there both the fear and the

2601
01:34:23,119 --> 01:34:27,599
excitement of that that has kind of a

2602
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:30,559
religious aspect to it sure that i find

2603
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:32,480
fascinating and in the right context

2604
01:34:30,560 --> 01:34:34,880
when you remove the skepticism

2605
01:34:32,479 --> 01:34:38,879
of government from that it's actually a

2606
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:41,118
hopeful longing uh do you have a

2607
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:43,520
do you see this kind of interesting

2608
01:34:41,118 --> 01:34:45,359
aliens as it all connected to your study

2609
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:47,119
of religion so you're the first person

2610
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:48,158
to ask me about aliens

2611
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:50,719
in eight months so it looks like i'm

2612
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:52,399
going on the record

2613
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:55,679
let's go so

2614
01:34:52,399 --> 01:34:56,479
um i'll drop some j allen heineck on you

2615
01:34:55,679 --> 01:34:57,840
um

2616
01:34:56,479 --> 01:34:59,839
so heinek

2617
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:02,719
um involved in project blue book

2618
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:05,119
famously says in 1966 when

2619
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:06,639
the long-awaited solution to the ufo

2620
01:35:05,118 --> 01:35:08,479
problem comes and we're assuming that

2621
01:35:06,639 --> 01:35:09,199
ufos have something to do with aliens

2622
01:35:08,479 --> 01:35:10,000
but

2623
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:12,638
um

2624
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:14,800
when the long-awaited solution comes i i

2625
01:35:12,639 --> 01:35:16,800
believe it will prove to be not merely

2626
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,520
the next small step in the march of

2627
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:21,119
science but a mighty and unexpected

2628
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,400
quantum leap

2629
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:25,198
in other words

2630
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:27,439
i do not think that we're dealing with

2631
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:29,759
flesh and blood beings in nuts and bolts

2632
01:35:27,439 --> 01:35:32,000
crafts i think it's way

2633
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:34,079
way more complicated than that and if

2634
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:36,560
anything it takes me back to the ancient

2635
01:35:34,079 --> 01:35:38,960
world it takes me back to this invisible

2636
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:41,360
college of beings of apparent higher

2637
01:35:38,960 --> 01:35:42,480
intent it takes me to the geniuses and

2638
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:44,559
the muses

2639
01:35:42,479 --> 01:35:46,559
so the first document in western

2640
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:49,199
civilization homer's

2641
01:35:46,560 --> 01:35:50,080
homer's epics they begin by invoking an

2642
01:35:49,198 --> 01:35:52,879
alien

2643
01:35:50,079 --> 01:35:55,519
they invoke a muse andra moya nepe musa

2644
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:58,719
polutre von jos malabola tell me o muse

2645
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:00,960
about the man so homer isn't inventing

2646
01:35:58,719 --> 01:36:03,760
poetry he's channeling

2647
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:05,198
poetry epic poetry from an alien

2648
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,280
intelligence

2649
01:36:05,198 --> 01:36:09,439
maybe that intelligence

2650
01:36:07,279 --> 01:36:12,399
has felt a little

2651
01:36:09,439 --> 01:36:13,919
unrecognized in recent years

2652
01:36:12,399 --> 01:36:16,399
trying to show up

2653
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:18,560
in human recognizable forms the muse is

2654
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:21,839
trying to give a little hint of

2655
01:36:18,560 --> 01:36:24,080
of its existence yeah i mean i i have a

2656
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:27,119
i've been saying i honestly sort of i

2657
01:36:24,079 --> 01:36:28,639
don't believe this but i

2658
01:36:27,118 --> 01:36:30,960
think about this

2659
01:36:28,639 --> 01:36:34,319
whether alien like muse is a great

2660
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:36,719
example whether aliens could be

2661
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:36,719
thoughts

2662
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:41,119
ideas we have are the aliens or

2663
01:36:39,439 --> 01:36:43,039
consciousness itself

2664
01:36:41,118 --> 01:36:44,880
is the methods by which aliens

2665
01:36:43,039 --> 01:36:46,800
communicate with us like i find this

2666
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:48,079
very kind of

2667
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:50,719
liberating

2668
01:36:48,079 --> 01:36:53,279
to expand our conception of what

2669
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:55,679
intelligent beings are

2670
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:57,599
you would like julian janes julian janes

2671
01:36:55,679 --> 01:36:59,279
writes a great book um

2672
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,039
the origins of consciousness and the

2673
01:36:59,279 --> 01:37:02,000
breakdown of the bicameral mind it's

2674
01:37:01,039 --> 01:37:04,479
this

2675
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:07,279
this theory that the ancient greek mind

2676
01:37:04,479 --> 01:37:08,959
was very different from ours and that

2677
01:37:07,279 --> 01:37:10,960
when they heard the muses they heard or

2678
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:12,399
the gods and goddesses for that matter

2679
01:37:10,960 --> 01:37:13,279
they would hear them as voices in the

2680
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:14,319
head

2681
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:15,920
and

2682
01:37:14,319 --> 01:37:18,880
hear it as

2683
01:37:15,920 --> 01:37:20,399
an internal god figure offering commands

2684
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:22,480
which they couldn't ignore so were they

2685
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:23,920
walking schizophrenics it might be one

2686
01:37:22,479 --> 01:37:26,158
way to talk about it before the

2687
01:37:23,920 --> 01:37:28,079
breakdown of the bicameral mind but it's

2688
01:37:26,158 --> 01:37:30,158
it's a provocative theory largely

2689
01:37:28,079 --> 01:37:32,639
untestable but when you're reading

2690
01:37:30,158 --> 01:37:34,238
ancient greek and latin for that matter

2691
01:37:32,639 --> 01:37:35,840
you can't read it very long without

2692
01:37:34,238 --> 01:37:37,759
bumping up against these discarnate

2693
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:40,560
entities they're everywhere

2694
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:42,239
um and they they survived they they

2695
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,360
persist across time which is even

2696
01:37:42,238 --> 01:37:44,879
stranger

2697
01:37:43,359 --> 01:37:46,559
not just in the form of all the things

2698
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,719
my daughters like like fairies and

2699
01:37:46,560 --> 01:37:50,719
gnomes and elves but

2700
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:53,039
and mckenna loves this the sylphs and

2701
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:55,439
the boulder grinders and the sprites and

2702
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:58,639
the gins and elementals every society

2703
01:37:55,439 --> 01:38:00,719
has them it seems to be fairly universal

2704
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:02,239
and they largely exist in in folklore

2705
01:38:00,719 --> 01:38:04,719
mythology this is what jacques vallee

2706
01:38:02,238 --> 01:38:07,198
writes about so wonderfully

2707
01:38:04,719 --> 01:38:09,118
we've kind of been uh sneaking around it

2708
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:10,638
but let me ask you from

2709
01:38:09,118 --> 01:38:12,399
yours

2710
01:38:10,639 --> 01:38:14,880
from everything we've been talking about

2711
01:38:12,399 --> 01:38:17,679
how do you think about consciousness

2712
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:19,840
is it uh is it a

2713
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:21,840
fun little trick that the human mind

2714
01:38:19,840 --> 01:38:23,920
does or is it somehow fundamental to

2715
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:24,639
this whole thing

2716
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:27,440
so

2717
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:29,440
uh this three pound lump of jelly

2718
01:38:27,439 --> 01:38:31,519
inside our craniums that can

2719
01:38:29,439 --> 01:38:33,759
contemplate

2720
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:36,639
the vastness of interstellar space it

2721
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:39,039
can contemplate the meaning of infinity

2722
01:38:36,639 --> 01:38:41,199
and it can contemplate itself

2723
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:43,519
contemplating on the meaning of infinity

2724
01:38:41,198 --> 01:38:46,079
that peculiar self-recursive quality

2725
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:48,159
that we call self-awareness so this is

2726
01:38:46,079 --> 01:38:50,800
the hard problem right this is this is

2727
01:38:48,158 --> 01:38:52,559
uh the unknowable the unknown at least

2728
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,960
yeah um i don't know

2729
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:56,480
i have no good answer for that aside

2730
01:38:54,960 --> 01:38:58,239
from do you think it's somehow

2731
01:38:56,479 --> 01:39:00,319
deeply fundamental to the human

2732
01:38:58,238 --> 01:39:02,718
experience or is it just a trick so you

2733
01:39:00,319 --> 01:39:02,719
have like

2734
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:07,039
i mean samurais has really been making

2735
01:39:04,479 --> 01:39:10,718
me uh think about this so you know

2736
01:39:07,039 --> 01:39:13,279
calling free will and illusion

2737
01:39:10,719 --> 01:39:15,760
the interesting thing about sam is

2738
01:39:13,279 --> 01:39:19,039
it's not just a philosophical little

2739
01:39:15,760 --> 01:39:23,280
chat with him about free will

2740
01:39:19,039 --> 01:39:24,960
he really says he experiences

2741
01:39:23,279 --> 01:39:27,439
the lack of free will

2742
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:29,600
like he's able to you know

2743
01:39:27,439 --> 01:39:31,759
large parts of the day to feel like he

2744
01:39:29,600 --> 01:39:34,079
has no free will

2745
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,480
in that same way

2746
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:38,079
now he thinks that consciousness

2747
01:39:36,479 --> 01:39:41,279
is um

2748
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:43,760
not an illusion it is you know it's a

2749
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:45,519
real thing but at the same i'm more

2750
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:47,199
almost like

2751
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,760
i'm almost more of like consciousness

2752
01:39:47,198 --> 01:39:51,519
seems to be a little bit of an illusion

2753
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:53,679
in the sense that like it feels like

2754
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,760
maybe this is a robotics ai perspective

2755
01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:58,639
but it feels like in that same way that

2756
01:39:55,760 --> 01:40:01,199
sam steps outside of

2757
01:39:58,639 --> 01:40:03,199
feeling like he has an agency

2758
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:04,960
feeling like he has a free will i feel

2759
01:40:03,198 --> 01:40:05,599
like we should be able to step outside

2760
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:09,079
of

2761
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,079
having a consciousness

2762
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:13,599
so that that from my perspective maybe

2763
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:15,359
that's a hopeful perspective for trying

2764
01:40:13,600 --> 01:40:17,679
to engineer consciousness but do you

2765
01:40:15,359 --> 01:40:20,399
think consciousness is like at the core

2766
01:40:17,679 --> 01:40:21,679
of this or is it just uh just like

2767
01:40:20,399 --> 01:40:24,479
language

2768
01:40:21,679 --> 01:40:25,760
or almost like a thing we build on top

2769
01:40:24,479 --> 01:40:28,479
of uh

2770
01:40:25,760 --> 01:40:30,239
much deeper human

2771
01:40:28,479 --> 01:40:32,319
the things that makes us human i don't

2772
01:40:30,238 --> 01:40:34,799
know i am attracted to lanza's notion of

2773
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:36,319
biocentrism i mean it's difficult to

2774
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,320
walk away from the double slit

2775
01:40:36,319 --> 01:40:41,439
experiment not wondering

2776
01:40:38,319 --> 01:40:43,679
why we seem capable of collapsing that

2777
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:46,638
quantum wave function it's very very

2778
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:48,639
weird um giving rise to even weirder

2779
01:40:46,639 --> 01:40:51,199
ideas about superposition and spooky

2780
01:40:48,639 --> 01:40:53,840
action at a distance and things that mit

2781
01:40:51,198 --> 01:40:55,839
guys know a lot better than me but um

2782
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:57,679
it seems to me fundamental maybe

2783
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:00,319
consciousness is is the fundamental

2784
01:40:57,679 --> 01:41:01,760
thing um i mean weirdly

2785
01:41:00,319 --> 01:41:03,439
some of these ancient incubatory

2786
01:41:01,760 --> 01:41:05,760
practices i talked about peter kingsley

2787
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:07,439
before so he's not a proponent of

2788
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,280
ancient psychedelic use but is a

2789
01:41:07,439 --> 01:41:10,638
proponent of these ancient rites of

2790
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:13,439
incubation

2791
01:41:10,639 --> 01:41:15,039
that were practiced by pythagoras

2792
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:16,559
parmenides and pedicles other

2793
01:41:15,039 --> 01:41:18,079
pre-socratics and so what were they

2794
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:20,239
doing they were trying to get in touch

2795
01:41:18,079 --> 01:41:22,880
with consciousness they were entering

2796
01:41:20,238 --> 01:41:24,799
into suspended states of animation

2797
01:41:22,880 --> 01:41:26,639
um in these cave-like settings

2798
01:41:24,800 --> 01:41:29,279
pythagoras had built one in his basement

2799
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:31,118
and would lie down motionless apparently

2800
01:41:29,279 --> 01:41:33,359
for long periods of time and what i

2801
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:36,000
think they were trying to do

2802
01:41:33,359 --> 01:41:37,759
was tap into and trying to answer this

2803
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,520
question in their own you could call it

2804
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,199
a scientific way actually less religion

2805
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,480
than science

2806
01:41:41,198 --> 01:41:44,479
and what they would

2807
01:41:42,479 --> 01:41:46,638
discover or try to discover was a state

2808
01:41:44,479 --> 01:41:49,439
of awareness that is somehow beyond life

2809
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:51,440
and death beyond waking and dreaming

2810
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:54,559
where you can be aware of the senses but

2811
01:41:51,439 --> 01:41:56,319
also in touch with another reality at

2812
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,480
the exact same time what kingsley calls

2813
01:41:56,319 --> 01:42:01,118
sensation

2814
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:03,519
that i think is definitely worth

2815
01:42:01,118 --> 01:42:06,000
exploring

2816
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:08,159
well and the way i hope to explore is by

2817
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:09,840
trying to build it but

2818
01:42:08,158 --> 01:42:12,238
everybody uses the tools they have well

2819
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:14,159
no i do also hope psychedelics can help

2820
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:16,238
so how do you build that i'm curious

2821
01:42:14,158 --> 01:42:17,679
that's a whole other discussion

2822
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:18,959
this is uh

2823
01:42:17,679 --> 01:42:21,279
there's a lot of things i can say here

2824
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:23,840
but let me put simply

2825
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:24,880
is i believe

2826
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,400
that

2827
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:29,840
you can go

2828
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:29,839
a long way

2829
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:32,880
building

2830
01:42:30,880 --> 01:42:34,560
towards building consciousness

2831
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:36,719
by trying to fake

2832
01:42:34,560 --> 01:42:39,039
consciousness

2833
01:42:36,719 --> 01:42:41,118
so fake it till you make it

2834
01:42:39,039 --> 01:42:43,140
as an engineering approach i think will

2835
01:42:41,118 --> 01:42:45,198
work for consciousness

2836
01:42:43,140 --> 01:42:47,520
[Laughter]

2837
01:42:45,198 --> 01:42:49,759
you seem satisfied with that i i'm

2838
01:42:47,520 --> 01:42:52,320
satisfied with that because i know how

2839
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:55,039
deeply unsatisfied others are

2840
01:42:52,319 --> 01:42:55,039
but just wait

2841
01:42:55,359 --> 01:42:59,839
so

2842
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:02,719
i mean i don't know what to so most most

2843
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:06,239
the the the topic of consciousness is

2844
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:07,520
mostly handled by philosophers currently

2845
01:43:06,238 --> 01:43:10,959
and

2846
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:12,560
that's great uh and their

2847
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:15,359
philosophers are wonderful and good at

2848
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:17,760
what they do i'm not a philosopher i'm

2849
01:43:15,359 --> 01:43:19,679
an engineer and i think the approach

2850
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:22,840
there is quite different

2851
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:22,840
i think

2852
01:43:24,319 --> 01:43:26,960
in love

2853
01:43:25,679 --> 01:43:28,960
is different

2854
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:31,439
than trying to have a podcast

2855
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:32,719
conversation about what is love

2856
01:43:31,439 --> 01:43:36,399
uh

2857
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:38,560
you know i i think the engineering

2858
01:43:36,399 --> 01:43:41,359
effort is just fundamentally different

2859
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:43,039
than the philosophical effort and i

2860
01:43:41,359 --> 01:43:44,399
have a sense that consciousness can be

2861
01:43:43,039 --> 01:43:46,238
engineered

2862
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:48,158
even before it is understood by the

2863
01:43:46,238 --> 01:43:50,479
philosophers so i think there's a bunch

2864
01:43:48,158 --> 01:43:51,759
of things like that in this world that

2865
01:43:50,479 --> 01:43:54,319
could be engineered before they're

2866
01:43:51,760 --> 01:43:57,039
understood i think the intelligence is

2867
01:43:54,319 --> 01:43:58,719
one such thing i think we'll be we'll

2868
01:43:57,039 --> 01:44:00,639
we'll be able to engineer

2869
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:03,600
super intelligent beings before we're

2870
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:04,840
able to understand the human mind

2871
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:07,360
that's

2872
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:08,800
um yeah i mean

2873
01:44:07,359 --> 01:44:12,880
there's less there's a lot of intuition

2874
01:44:08,800 --> 01:44:14,239
to unpack there of why that is but um

2875
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:16,480
as it stands

2876
01:44:14,238 --> 01:44:18,959
that's perhaps my engineering

2877
01:44:16,479 --> 01:44:21,439
um optimism and engineering ethic under

2878
01:44:18,960 --> 01:44:23,439
which i operate

2879
01:44:21,439 --> 01:44:24,799
consciousness is easy to build hard to

2880
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:25,329
understand

2881
01:44:24,800 --> 01:44:27,600
okay

2882
01:44:25,329 --> 01:44:30,880
[Laughter]

2883
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:32,880
are there books or movies in your life

2884
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,880
long ago or recently

2885
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:35,679
that had a big impact on you

2886
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,440
you've

2887
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:39,199
you've uh

2888
01:44:37,439 --> 01:44:41,118
immortality key is exceptionally well

2889
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:43,919
researched

2890
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:45,920
the amount of books you read is uh

2891
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:47,920
i cannot even imagine so is there

2892
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:48,800
something in those in that in those in

2893
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:52,399
your

2894
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:54,400
travels through the land of language

2895
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:56,158
that stuck with you that was especially

2896
01:44:54,399 --> 01:44:57,279
impactful i mentioned a couple of them

2897
01:44:56,158 --> 01:45:00,399
but

2898
01:44:57,279 --> 01:45:02,559
so i i knew nothing about psychedelics

2899
01:45:00,399 --> 01:45:04,799
before 2007.

2900
01:45:02,560 --> 01:45:06,320
and it was in in hearing about some of

2901
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,800
the first psilocybin experiments at

2902
01:45:06,319 --> 01:45:11,359
hopkins and then shortly thereafter

2903
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:13,119
i went down this rabbit hole and so the

2904
01:45:11,359 --> 01:45:15,198
first set of recommendations all kind of

2905
01:45:13,118 --> 01:45:19,359
fit in that time period in my life

2906
01:45:15,198 --> 01:45:22,000
2007 2008 it started with jeremy narby

2907
01:45:19,359 --> 01:45:22,960
the cosmic serpent dna in the origins of

2908
01:45:22,000 --> 01:45:24,399
knowledge

2909
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:26,880
it was a total

2910
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:28,479
impulse buy at the barnes noble on 6th

2911
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,639
avenue in new york

2912
01:45:28,479 --> 01:45:33,279
and wound up introducing me to

2913
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:34,319
supernatural by graham hancock

2914
01:45:33,279 --> 01:45:36,639
um

2915
01:45:34,319 --> 01:45:39,920
that that convinced me that there was a

2916
01:45:36,639 --> 01:45:42,400
long story to psychedelics that

2917
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:43,679
um he tried to prove in that book and

2918
01:45:42,399 --> 01:45:44,559
that we're still trying to prove i

2919
01:45:43,679 --> 01:45:46,560
mentioned

2920
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:49,679
the connection between ritual

2921
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:51,840
psychedelics and cave art

2922
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:53,920
this is the the neuropsychological model

2923
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:55,279
that was first proposed by david lewis

2924
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:57,039
williams at the university of

2925
01:45:55,279 --> 01:45:59,198
waterstream the the same university

2926
01:45:57,039 --> 01:46:01,840
where lee berger is by the way in south

2927
01:45:59,198 --> 01:46:03,919
africa so these ideas are old um but

2928
01:46:01,840 --> 01:46:06,000
what graham did in that book is just um

2929
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:07,920
it's it's well worth your time it's well

2930
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,118
worth a few reads actually

2931
01:46:07,920 --> 01:46:10,158
because it was after that that i

2932
01:46:09,118 --> 01:46:11,759
discovered

2933
01:46:10,158 --> 01:46:14,960
breaking open the head by daniel

2934
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:17,119
pinchback um and and a lot a lot of

2935
01:46:14,960 --> 01:46:19,118
other books that just um

2936
01:46:17,118 --> 01:46:20,399
kind of blew my mind what is uh breaking

2937
01:46:19,118 --> 01:46:23,118
open the head about

2938
01:46:20,399 --> 01:46:25,279
so it's it's it's daniel's romp through

2939
01:46:23,118 --> 01:46:28,719
contemporary shamanism

2940
01:46:25,279 --> 01:46:30,238
and it's his uh very well told

2941
01:46:28,719 --> 01:46:33,198
experiences with everything from

2942
01:46:30,238 --> 01:46:35,279
psilocybin to iboga being initiated by

2943
01:46:33,198 --> 01:46:37,439
the buitis

2944
01:46:35,279 --> 01:46:39,279
and it was the the first time i'd read

2945
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:41,359
uh any first-hand accounts aside from

2946
01:46:39,279 --> 01:46:43,198
jeremy narby any first-hand accounts but

2947
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:46,158
by a new yorker by the way

2948
01:46:43,198 --> 01:46:48,399
um about the potential for these these

2949
01:46:46,158 --> 01:46:51,359
compounds that i'd been ignoring for far

2950
01:46:48,399 --> 01:46:53,759
too long obviously um and so that's when

2951
01:46:51,359 --> 01:46:54,719
i started revisiting the road to ellucis

2952
01:46:53,760 --> 01:46:56,079
and

2953
01:46:54,719 --> 01:46:57,679
looking through the anthropological

2954
01:46:56,079 --> 01:46:59,519
literature reading everything gordon

2955
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:01,359
watson had ever written that carl ruck

2956
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:02,719
had written

2957
01:47:01,359 --> 01:47:05,279
and it sent me down a pretty weird

2958
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:07,600
rabbit hole until i found peter kingsley

2959
01:47:05,279 --> 01:47:09,840
which is my second recommendation so so

2960
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:12,719
peter again he's not a fan of the

2961
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:14,719
psychedelic hypothesis but what he does

2962
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:17,198
is i think expose

2963
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:18,480
the value of the irrational to the

2964
01:47:17,198 --> 01:47:20,879
ancient greeks especially the

2965
01:47:18,479 --> 01:47:23,519
pre-socratics here we are talking about

2966
01:47:20,880 --> 01:47:25,520
a.i and god and these

2967
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:27,440
you know entangled philosophical

2968
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:30,080
questions um

2969
01:47:27,439 --> 01:47:32,399
the best i can read kingsley is that

2970
01:47:30,079 --> 01:47:34,559
western civilization is a product of a

2971
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:36,879
gift from the goddess persephone

2972
01:47:34,560 --> 01:47:38,080
and this is not a hippie this is this is

2973
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,239
a

2974
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:42,559
a pretty gold standard classicist who

2975
01:47:40,238 --> 01:47:44,959
went on to write a couple of books uh

2976
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,800
one is in the dark places of wisdom and

2977
01:47:44,960 --> 01:47:48,960
the other is reality

2978
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:50,480
what better way to title your book

2979
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:53,439
where he talks about these ancient

2980
01:47:50,479 --> 01:47:54,799
techniques for exploring the irrational

2981
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:56,079
the same thing carl rock was talking

2982
01:47:54,800 --> 01:47:57,920
about

2983
01:47:56,079 --> 01:47:59,439
after compiling all this data in the

2984
01:47:57,920 --> 01:48:01,840
road to ellucis ruck says that the

2985
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:03,919
biggest challenge is trying to convince

2986
01:48:01,840 --> 01:48:06,079
his colleagues in the late 1970s that

2987
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:08,158
the ancient greeks and indeed some of

2988
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:11,198
the most famous and intelligent among

2989
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:13,279
them could enter you know so fully into

2990
01:48:11,198 --> 01:48:15,439
irrationality same thing nietzsche's

2991
01:48:13,279 --> 01:48:17,279
talking about in his exploration of

2992
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:18,559
dionysus and so i think kingsley just

2993
01:48:17,279 --> 01:48:21,118
stands apart

2994
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:23,360
as um you know one of those books

2995
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:26,799
reality that my life was never quite the

2996
01:48:23,359 --> 01:48:30,319
same after reading that

2997
01:48:26,800 --> 01:48:30,320
we talked about three-pound

2998
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:38,480
uh jelly that uh is able to conceive

2999
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:40,480
of the entirety of um

3000
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:42,879
the fabric of reality in the universe

3001
01:48:40,479 --> 01:48:46,759
and everything and uh oh

3002
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:46,760
also of its own mortality

3003
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:50,880
what do you think is the meaning of it

3004
01:48:49,118 --> 01:48:54,000
all

3005
01:48:50,880 --> 01:48:54,000
what's the meaning of life

3006
01:48:55,679 --> 01:48:59,679
is a three-pound jelly able to answer

3007
01:48:57,840 --> 01:49:01,679
that one

3008
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:04,319
no but i can plagiarize joseph campbell

3009
01:49:01,679 --> 01:49:06,399
which is uh which is good enough um

3010
01:49:04,319 --> 01:49:08,000
joe joe campbell says that you know i

3011
01:49:06,399 --> 01:49:09,519
don't think what we're looking for is a

3012
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,000
meaning of life

3013
01:49:09,520 --> 01:49:14,880
i think what we're looking for is an

3014
01:49:11,000 --> 01:49:16,639
experience of being alive so that the

3015
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:18,000
experiences we have on the purely

3016
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:19,840
physical plane

3017
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,399
will have resonances within that are

3018
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,840
those of our innermost being and reality

3019
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:25,359
you talked about the true reality

3020
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:28,000
absolute truth

3021
01:49:25,359 --> 01:49:30,000
um these are all constructs and i think

3022
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:33,039
they're they're constructs that that are

3023
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,039
made day by day and acquire this aura of

3024
01:49:33,039 --> 01:49:37,039
factuality remembering clifford geertz's

3025
01:49:35,039 --> 01:49:38,158
definition of religion

3026
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:40,238
we're all just

3027
01:49:38,158 --> 01:49:42,079
faking it until we make it and i think a

3028
01:49:40,238 --> 01:49:44,399
lot of that has to do with moods and

3029
01:49:42,079 --> 01:49:46,639
motivations and feelings and emotions

3030
01:49:44,399 --> 01:49:47,839
which is not to discredit facts and

3031
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:50,880
figures

3032
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:51,920
but i think that meaning meaning making

3033
01:49:50,880 --> 01:49:54,639
is a

3034
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:56,158
very subjective process that is

3035
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:58,639
not only difficult to talk about but

3036
01:49:56,158 --> 01:50:00,879
difficult to quantify an experience is a

3037
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:03,440
primary in that versus

3038
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,118
so like the actual subjective experience

3039
01:50:03,439 --> 01:50:07,759
is primary to

3040
01:50:05,118 --> 01:50:09,039
the meaning making process versus like

3041
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,039
some kind of

3042
01:50:09,039 --> 01:50:14,479
rigorous analysis of

3043
01:50:11,039 --> 01:50:17,039
like uh having an algorithm that runs

3044
01:50:14,479 --> 01:50:19,039
and computes and and then finally spits

3045
01:50:17,039 --> 01:50:20,800
out 42.

3046
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:23,519
well this this is how families are

3047
01:50:20,800 --> 01:50:25,199
created um tell me more about my wife

3048
01:50:23,520 --> 01:50:27,440
and i fell in love and made babies we

3049
01:50:25,198 --> 01:50:28,960
didn't we didn't type up an excel sheet

3050
01:50:27,439 --> 01:50:30,719
and figure out the best way to go about

3051
01:50:28,960 --> 01:50:31,840
this that's what i've been doing all

3052
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,939
these years

3053
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:36,319
that's why i'm single

3054
01:50:32,939 --> 01:50:39,198
[Laughter]

3055
01:50:36,319 --> 01:50:41,118
too many excel sheets uh what we say

3056
01:50:39,198 --> 01:50:43,279
falling in love right we say fall in

3057
01:50:41,118 --> 01:50:45,039
love what does that mean to fall in love

3058
01:50:43,279 --> 01:50:46,719
you are surrendering

3059
01:50:45,039 --> 01:50:49,599
to an intelligence

3060
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:51,118
um that that that is beyond us um you

3061
01:50:49,599 --> 01:50:52,880
could say a god-like intelligence

3062
01:50:51,118 --> 01:50:55,039
richard rohr the franciscan friar i

3063
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:56,960
mentioned in the universal christ he

3064
01:50:55,039 --> 01:51:00,319
writes a lot about how

3065
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:02,158
the divine for you is is often

3066
01:51:00,319 --> 01:51:03,840
encountered in in the other in fact how

3067
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:06,000
could it be otherwise this is this is

3068
01:51:03,840 --> 01:51:06,960
bedrock sacramental theology that you

3069
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,198
find

3070
01:51:06,960 --> 01:51:10,960
the god in the things in your life as

3071
01:51:09,198 --> 01:51:11,839
well you should that that's the proving

3072
01:51:10,960 --> 01:51:15,279
ground

3073
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:16,880
for identifying as god rather than

3074
01:51:15,279 --> 01:51:18,960
creating a relationship with god and so

3075
01:51:16,880 --> 01:51:20,560
i think that these irrational states

3076
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:22,399
play a big role in that

3077
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:24,320
ratio well i don't think there's a

3078
01:51:22,399 --> 01:51:28,000
better way to end it than on the topic

3079
01:51:24,319 --> 01:51:30,399
of love brian thank you so much for a

3080
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:32,319

3081
01:51:30,399 --> 01:51:34,479
and the poetry

3082
01:51:32,319 --> 01:51:36,479
i really appreciate you uh talking with

conversation with brian miura rescue and

3087
01:51:42,079 --> 01:51:46,399
thank you to inside tracker givewell

3088
01:51:45,439 --> 01:51:49,118
and i

3089
01:51:46,399 --> 01:51:50,559
indeed and master class check them out

3090
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:52,000
in the description to support this

3091
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:54,239
podcast

3092
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:57,760
and now let me leave you some words from

3093
01:51:54,238 --> 01:51:59,839
terence mckenna about psychedelics

3094
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:01,840
part of what psychedelics do

3095
01:51:59,840 --> 01:52:02,880
is they decondition you from cultural

3096
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,800
values

3097
01:52:02,880 --> 01:52:07,199
this is what makes it such a political

3098
01:52:04,800 --> 01:52:09,520
hot potato since all culture is a kind

3099
01:52:07,198 --> 01:52:12,079
of con game the most dangerous candy you

3100
01:52:09,520 --> 01:52:14,840
can hand out is one which causes people

3101
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:17,279
to start questioning the rules of the

3102
01:52:14,840 --> 01:52:21,239
game thank you for listening and hope to

3103
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:21,238
see you next time
