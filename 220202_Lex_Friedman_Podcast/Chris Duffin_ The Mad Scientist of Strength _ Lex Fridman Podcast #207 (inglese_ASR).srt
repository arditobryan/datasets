00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,838
chris duffin

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,878
the mad scientist of strength he's one

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,599
of the strongest

5
00:00:06,878 --> 00:00:10,960
people in the world but is also an

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,880
engineer of some of the most

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,799
innovative strength equipment i've ever

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,600
seen check out his company

9
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:18,399
kabuki strength he is the only person

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,118
who squatted

11
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,919
and deadlifted 1 000 pounds for multiple

12
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:24,000
reps

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,118
and achieved many other amazing feats of

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,439
strength he has lived one hell of a life

15
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,480
of hardship and triumph as he writes

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,679
about in his book

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,280
called the ego and the dragon quick

18
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:38,399
mention of our sponsors

19
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,480

20
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,280

21
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:45,359
description to support this podcast

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,960
as a side note let me say that i was

23
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:48,960
always a fan of strength

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,239
both power lifting and olympic

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,280
weightlifting

26
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,038
both as a fan and practitioner

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,359
mostly i'm a fan of people who are

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,120
willing to put in years of hard work

29
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,119
towards finding out what the limits of

30
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,599
their body is and then

31
00:01:01,119 --> 00:01:04,558
smashing past those limits people like

32
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,200
chris duffin

33
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,079
or on the olympic weightlifting side

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,359
people like

35
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:13,519
dmitry klokov that guy's great

36
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:15,759
this is why i love watching the olympics

37
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,000
both the heartbreaks and the triumphs

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,359
they all reveal the incredible heights

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,400
that the human mind

40
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:23,920
and the human body can reach this is the

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,640
lex friedman podcast

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,159
and here is my conversation with chris

43
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,799
duffin

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,040
you've been a part of several incredible

45
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:35,439
feats of strength

46
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,280
which was the hardest or maybe one

47
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:39,438
you're most proud of

48
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,118
definitely the one i'm most proud of is

49
00:01:39,438 --> 00:01:43,199
that journey

50
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,200
for the the grand goals it was like a

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,359
five-year scope that i chased this

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,200
and so when you think about training it

53
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:50,640
took more than five years obviously

54
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,880
by that point i've been training for

55
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,040
over 25 years

56
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:56,959
but it makes me proud i mean there was

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,560
three distinct things that i wanted to

58
00:01:56,959 --> 00:01:59,839
accomplish out of this so it was really

59
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,799
thought out

60
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,680
um and this was kind of my exit from

61
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,040
being a

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,800
a competitive lifter and basically

63
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,479
saying hey i'm gonna be

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,560
you know an instagram lift or an uh

65
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,920
exhibition lift or a whatever

66
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,120
i've done this for 16 years i was number

67
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:18,719
one in the world for like eight years

68
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,080
straight all-time world records and i'm

69
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,598
like i'm not going to do that anymore

70
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,239
what i want to do

71
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,359
is just something deep down to me that

72
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,280
is really important

73
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,800
and there's three things that were

74
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,598
driving this and this is a five year

75
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,000
journey that i

76
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:34,318
that i went through to do this i really

77
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,959
wanted to showcase

78
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,799
that you could do something that is well

79
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,719
beyond the scope of what people think is

80
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,800
humanly possible so

81
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:47,039
just this inspiration thing this

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,120
grand over the top like if you set your

83
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,199
mind to a single-minded goal you can go

84
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
so much further and i didn't even say

85
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:54,639
what the goal was up front

86
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,400
because it was so far out there i would

87
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,238
have been laughed at and that's

88
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,319
i i think big goals should be kept

89
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,840
pretty damn close uh to start with for

90
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,919
that reason too

91
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,000
um but and then the second piece was to

92
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:07,759
to to walk the walk to show

93
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
like the principles of what i believed

94
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:12,239
in around human movement

95
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,920
um the ability to manage and control the

96
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,039
spinal mechanics and the output that can

97
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:16,639
have on the body

98
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:18,079
and so i wanted to take the two most

99
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:20,079
basic movements that

100
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,760
every able-bodied person should be able

101
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
to do so fundamental

102
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,158
movement patterns the squat which is

103
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:27,839
like in the developmental approach is

104
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,759
around nine months as a baby from a

105
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,799
developmental kinesiology

106
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,120
standpoint and a really basic pattern

107
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,480
that

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,840
every able-bodied person should be able

109
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,560
to master the other one being the hip

110
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,080
hinge

111
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,400
being able to pick something up off the

112
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,280
ground a deadlift

113
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,840
and i wanted to do those two not just

114
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,080
one

115
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,239
because i wanted to show the principles

116
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,920
that i wasn't

117
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,120
uh built for one i wasn't a specialist

118
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,399
because of

119
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,519
my lever links torso links all that any

120
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,799
outliers

121
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,239
because nobody had ever done a thousand

122
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,680
pound squat so this is it

123
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,560
is and a thousand pound deadlift

124
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,080
it was outside of the scope of what

125
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,438
anybody's there's like half a dozen

126
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,080
people that have done one

127
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:15,840
or the other but nobody's ever done both

128
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,280
and i wanted to do something unique i

129
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,840
wanted to do them

130
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,559
not only do it but do them for reps to

131
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,719
leave literally

132
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,720
no question out there and there's no

133
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,759
competition for that

134
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,240
so it was this is what i'm gonna go do

135
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,560
and

136
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,319
to pull it off i had some past issues

137
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,160
with my elbows and stuff that i couldn't

138
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,759
work around so i had to wear

139
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,360
straps which was another reason i

140
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,879
couldn't do it in the competition

141
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,800
setting

142
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,079
so the first year i worked up and i did

143
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,079
a thousand and two

144
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:45,359
pound deadlift we plates were weight

145
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:45,918
afterwards it was a couple a little bit

146
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,199
over

147
00:04:45,918 --> 00:04:50,719
and i did it for almost three reps

148
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,360
and that still stands as a guinness

149
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:56,000
world record the just the one rep does

150
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,720
is the most weight ever sumo deadlifted

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,079
and

152
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,520
one other person has deadlifted a

153
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,399
thousand for reps at this point and that

154
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:02,478
was uh thor

155
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:05,038
bjornsson uh from game of thrones he's

156
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,879
done a thousand for a double as well so

157
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,240
then the next four years and i did a

158
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,879
bunch of feats of strength on the way

159
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,000
but it was

160
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,839
all about building that axial loading

161
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,439
capacity the strength of because now i'm

162
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:16,399
moving the weight from my hands up to my

163
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,279
shoulders

164
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:20,319
and so to do it for reps is like so much

165
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,159
harder than a single

166
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:26,079
like 5 to 10 seconds versus 30

167
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,520
plus seconds to be able to buffer and

168
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:30,879
manage all that

169
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:32,799
with that kind of load is just crazy so

170
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,800
it's literally about the duration that

171
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,879
your body is carrying the load

172
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,079
yeah that's a big part of it yeah

173
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,600
because you have to

174
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,519
you're using the resource of the

175
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,439
diaphragm for stabilization

176
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:45,198
and so it it's also responsible for

177
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,560
respiration and all this other stuff so

178
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,160
even when you're not squatting you've

179
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,399
got to be handling those loads

180
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,840
just holding that weight is fascinating

181
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:53,279
it's like it's fascinating that the

182
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,079
human body

183
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:56,959
can do that can can maintain that

184
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,959
structure

185
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,079
just everything working together that

186
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,159
the biology

187
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,079
the skeletal structure the the

188
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,680
musculature on top of that can

189
00:06:04,079 --> 00:06:08,240
hold the weight it's fascinating to

190
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,038
watch everything is very intentful about

191
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,439
positioning

192
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:12,959
and how you're creating pressure and all

193
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,839
this sort of stuff especially for me so

194
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,519
when i mentioned that

195
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,198
half a dozen people have squatted it and

196
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,478
half a dozen people have deadlifted it

197
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,800
you understand those people all weigh

198
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:24,000
380 to 440 pounds

199
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,840
i weighed 265 to 285 depending on the

200
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,399
where i was between the two

201
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,679
so there's that as well right so big big

202
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,318
difference

203
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
and uh over the course of that i did a

204
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,039
lot of

205
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,840
other feats of strength that fit in that

206
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:40,240
capacity and we can skip over those but

207
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,359
that was hugely invested as far as you

208
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,280
know

209
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,038
what i put into being able to accomplish

210
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:45,599
that because it's it's over the top

211
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,759
which means

212
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,280
the other stuff had to shift and i had

213
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,720
to learn something

214
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:53,198
there's so many things that came into

215
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,759
place to pull that off and so yeah last

216
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,400
march

217
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,680
two days before the world shutdown i did

218
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,679
it it was supposed to be

219
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,840
at the largest equipment exhibition in

220
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,840
the world down in san diego

221
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,000
as an event and that got shut down a

222
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:08,159
week beforehand obviously so we moved to

223
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,759
let's do it in my gym and invite people

224
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,199
and that was on a saturday and thursday

225
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,840
or friday they limited it to

226
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,720
25 people for gatherings i did it on

227
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,519
saturday

228
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,919
and then monday everything shut down so

229
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:20,399
wow

230
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,478
it was kind of surreal for timing-wise

231
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,959
right and so if i hadn't done it it

232
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,800
would have never got done like because i

233
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,638
i'd pushed to the limit i couldn't come

234
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
back and do it it was at the total

235
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,319
limitation of my capabilities so

236
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,840
i'm pretty i'm pretty proud of it and

237
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,280
the last piece was uh

238
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,799
every one of these feats along the way i

239
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,559
collaborated with a charity that i

240
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,598
believed in and there was a lot of those

241
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,720
tied to my life

242
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:47,839
story uh which we probably will get into

243
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,039
um so it was threefold so that

244
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:51,519
inspiration piece

245
00:07:49,038 --> 00:07:52,639
inspiration motivation walking the walk

246
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:56,240
and showing

247
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,879
like just the these methodologies that a

248
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
guy that

249
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,319
had to learn to walk again can do

250
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,639
something like this with no back pain if

251
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,080
you

252
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:06,000
if you there is a way and the third one

253
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,680
is is to provide awareness and

254
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,720
recognition around a lot of

255
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,560
um key charities so so

256
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,720
your heart was in this journey but also

257
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,720
your mind is just you're like a scholar

258
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,160
of strength a scientist of strength an

259
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,120
engineer of strength

260
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,960
for reps do a thousand pounds squat and

261
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,439
deadlift

262
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:27,279
let's first talk through the actual day

263
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,360
you did it

264
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:36,879
what does it take to lift that much

265
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:40,320
for reps the day of is really easy

266
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,838
the really the lift itself other than a

267
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,839
few seconds

268
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,959
is really easy and not challenging

269
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,959
people always ask me

270
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:48,559
what was it like how beat up were you

271
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,119
after that and the deadlift and the

272
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:55,439
simple fact is it was easy

273
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:58,639
the work to get there was horrendous

274
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,160
so so even the psychology of the day

275
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,159
you weren't there was not a fear there

276
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,799
was not a nervousness there was not a

277
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,240
doubt

278
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:05,838
in your mind uh there were certainly

279
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,399
doubts on that day um

280
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,760
from some training history so there was

281
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:11,839
some major

282
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:13,120
breaks to my confidence in the couple

283
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:16,399
months leading up

284
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:18,560
where i had issues with passing out

285
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,839
under the bar so completely losing

286
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,359
consciousness and this was

287
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,680
on weight less than a thousand pounds

288
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,919
even so

289
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,199
that was like all this build up in me

290
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,159
going

291
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,440
what if what if it i think i have this

292
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,278
resolved

293
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,640
but what if i get up there and i can't

294
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:36,480
even do a rep

295
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,240
how embarrassing will this be that i've

296
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,720
been talking about this and planning for

297
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,680
this for so long

298
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,600
but outside of that i knew i could do it

299
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,159
in fact i wanted to do even more even up

300
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
to the

301
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,399
the second rep training is about you

302
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:54,399
know working

303
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:57,919
into a fatigue state so you're building

304
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,600
uh an amount of fatigue in your system

305
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:01,039
and then when you let off of it that's

306
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,480
when you get a compensation and that's

307
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,480
how you stair-step training this is

308
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,039
periodization but leading into a big

309
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
event

310
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,039
you're accumulating this massive amount

311
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,879
of fatigue and so

312
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:12,639
i was performing at a level that i could

313
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,000
do it and so i knew

314
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:15,759
i was going to be able to on meet

315
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,039
because then you then you give yourself

316
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,639
that window

317
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:20,799
to be able to recover and super

318
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,639
compensate and be able to do a little

319
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,359
bit more so like that first rep when i

320
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:26,000
did it

321
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,639
strength wise i went i could do this for

322
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,759
five reps

323
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,078
like it went through my head i'm like

324
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:32,639
dealing i mean it was easy and it was

325
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,399
fast and it felt like amazing and i'm

326
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:37,439
like i'm gonna crush this

327
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,320
and then set rep two uh the realization

328
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,160
kicked in is like

329
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,440
oh this is for reps with a thousand

330
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,000
pounds on your back

331
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,760
and you're fatiguing just like and then

332
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,159
the third one was

333
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:48,958
every last thing i could muster to just

334
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:51,278
finish that i mean

335
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:52,319
i just barely got it done because it's

336
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,879
the strength is

337
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,920
like there but like that capacity to be

338
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,000
able to manage

339
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:59,759
all those resources for that amount of

340
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
time because not just leg strength when

341
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:05,120
we're talking about this stuff so

342
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,600
what does it take to go from the

343
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,039
from i don't know what like from 500 to

344
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,680
a thousand

345
00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:12,639
that feels like a journey that's like

346
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:16,239
exponential

347
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:17,919
it's it is exponentially harder it does

348
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,440
in the early 2000s like i said i started

349
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:22,000
lift in 1988

350
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,640
um but my first meet in the early 2000s

351
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,078
my

352
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:28,399
my max deadlift was 523 and my first

353
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:31,439
squat was 550.

354
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,320
so uh friends that's a heck of a journey

355
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,040
it is a journey for people that like to

356
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,480
lift

357
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,399
what should they understand about the

358
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
difference between doing 500 and a

359
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,919
thousand

360
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,278
in terms of the actual lift that you

361
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:44,719
were experiencing that day

362
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:46,559
in terms of the mechanics in terms of

363
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,959
all the things you have to be like the

364
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,799
neurological adaptation you mentioned

365
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,359
the breathing

366
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,719
the core strength what like techniques

367
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,639
like little tricks

368
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,639
psychological tricks anything that kind

369
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:01,360
of stands out to you

370
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,680
the level of intent and the opportunity

371
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,759
for

372
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:08,479
error are at a different level so

373
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,200
just the minutes changes of position by

374
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,560
quarter inch

375
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
half inch can be make or break at that

376
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,599
level so

377
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,240
these things everything gets amplified

378
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,320
so the ability to start with having

379
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:22,839
the pelvis just in the right orientation

380
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:25,278
to the diaphragm before we start

381
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,040
initiating what we call the the

382
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:27,838
eccentric loading of the abdominal

383
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,838
cavity

384
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,279
to create this intra-abdominal pressure

385
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,040
of working against

386
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:34,958
this outward expansion working against

387
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,199
the outer sheath of

388
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:38,559
abdominal thoracic lumbar musculature

389
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,800
obliques

390
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,599
causing the co-contraction at the pelvic

391
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:43,359
floor

392
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,480
all this stuff and how you cue that

393
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,680
because you can't think about all this

394
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,600
stuff you need to break it down and

395
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,879
distill and practice to like it's

396
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:54,800
one simple cue that we now lock down

397
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,480
and control this torso stability because

398
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,319
this is what these fundamental movements

399
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,039
are about is being able to control

400
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,920
our spinal mechanics and then now be

401
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,159
able to

402
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:06,000
maintain that while articulating the

403
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,838
joints around that through a range of

404
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,240
motion uh and then using

405
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,519
the main power drivers so in this

406
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,159
instance both instances

407
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:17,039
it's the you know the hip complex to

408
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,958
generate

409
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,360
that power and transfer it from how

410
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:23,359
we're rooted and connected to the floor

411
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,759
through to the distal end you know which

412
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,839
would be the barbell on the shoulder

413
00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:29,439
you know there's a couple key concepts

414
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,160
so one is that what we just talked

415
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,079
through is

416
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,199
how to actually maintain that stability

417
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:36,000
so if you have

418
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,839
either the diaphragm so which is

419
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,480
connected at the rib cage so out of

420
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,040
alignment

421
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,759
in any position it needs to be in

422
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,399
alignment

423
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,000
with the pelvic of the pelvis so those

424
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,519
two in opposition so this is simple

425
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,679
engineering here

426
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,879
because what we're going to do is

427
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:52,479
eccentrically load this we're going to

428
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,078
use the diaphragm just like you would in

429
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,159
a diaphragm pump

430
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:57,759
where it's going to press down on all

431
00:13:56,159 --> 00:13:58,719
the tissue in there so we're not using

432
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,159
breath

433
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,759
so our breath was actually a lot of

434
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,198
times a default pattern when people do

435
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:04,000
that because they'll bring it into their

436
00:14:03,198 --> 00:14:07,919
chest

437
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,759
and raise their rib cage so

438
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,599
what we want to do is just initiate the

439
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,399
diaphragm air can be used as well over

440
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,320
the top

441
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,519
at the final to create just a little bit

442
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,399
more downward pressure

443
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,959
but if we have out of alignment there we

444
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,078
have

445
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:23,838
a pressure get leak where it's going to

446
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,239
be push out the front or the rear if

447
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,560
you're either in flexion or extension

448
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,560
all right and then that causes this

449
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:33,679
co-contraction and all this pressure of

450
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,278
of uh the organs essentially against

451
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:37,039
outward against all those tissue for the

452
00:14:35,278 --> 00:14:39,120
co-contraction as well as surrounding

453
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,958
the spine to be able to stabilize that

454
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,320
and then it puts all the muscles on both

455
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:45,439
sides of the body

456
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,839
in what we call the the best length

457
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,920
tension relationship so if you think

458
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,720
about a curl and we reach our arm out

459
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:53,439
at the extended length our bicep is not

460
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,879
as strong

461
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,240
and then all the way in the curl

462
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,439
position it's not in strong there's

463
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,079
somewhere in here that

464
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,360
this control of both and so when you're

465
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,078
sitting there

466
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,560
arched or bent over we have muscles that

467
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:06,638
are

468
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,000
past either one of those ranges so

469
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,680
they've got a lot of tension which then

470
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,720
will create relaxation on the other side

471
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:12,958
right so we want to have

472
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,399
and all of that needs to be working and

473
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:18,638
now the next important thing is the foot

474
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,679
so it's actually this connection to the

475
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,600
ground

476
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,278
and how we're actually using the foot

477
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,240
and ankle complex

478
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,720
to grab and grip this connection to the

479
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,919
ground

480
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,399
and elicit uh an effect and because of

481
00:15:29,919 --> 00:15:32,639
this

482
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,958
and then the everything between will

483
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,919
naturally kind of do what it needs to do

484
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:40,159
so people like to focus on knee knee

485
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:43,278
position or how far out their hips are

486
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,159
or all this other stuff which is outputs

487
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,480
of this

488
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:48,078
so if we control the torso and the knee

489
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,278
the only thing that can happen from that

490
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:52,638
point

491
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:55,120
is for the squat to happen

492
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,278
all right um so this allows us to use

493
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,519
this massive

494
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,919
you know the hip complex for all the

495
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,839
muscles around that that are

496
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,039
built to drive through hip extension to

497
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,720
complete the squat

498
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,159
i did actually miss one thing in there

499
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,240
so this torso people

500
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,439
often miss the lat is a spinal

501
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,519
stabilizer as well

502
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,759
so that's key in controlling function at

503
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,078
the the tl junction

504
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,039
which is um just above the the lumbar

505
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,559
spine so

506
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,000
kind of right opposite where your

507
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:23,439
sternum is and you'll see people kind of

508
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,720
roll over sometimes like an olympic

509
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,560
squad or something like that where they

510
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,839
lose position

511
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:29,198
and that's often because they're close

512
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,399
grip because you can't engage the lats

513
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:31,359
very well that way and they're pushing

514
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,278
up in the bar

515
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,120
but you want to be able to drive and

516
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:36,879
pull the bar to your center and that's

517
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,440
going to create and use the lats now to

518
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,720
drive

519
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,320
and connect the shoulder into this

520
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,079
we're kind of compressing and tightening

521
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,639
all this stuff towards that center to

522
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:46,479
create

523
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,639
that entire torso stability that's why i

524
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,360
was using torso stability not just

525
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:53,278
core stability uh in my conversation

526
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,759
earlier

527
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:57,198
okay so there's all these like modules

528
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,519
yeah with the body

529
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:02,078
then connected to the grounding with

530
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,880
like your feet on the ground

531
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:06,318
everything you're speaking to how do you

532
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,880
work each of those modules

533
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,798
is this over time you kind of develop

534
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,880
the feel that ultimately boils down to

535
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,838
this one simple cue that you mentioned

536
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,919
or do you can you like literally study

537
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:19,279
each particular module and yourself and

538
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:21,600
see how it affects the

539
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:22,879
lift so the best way and i believe it's

540
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,958
because i hate just like

541
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,640
people getting out and just doing just

542
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,839
movement stuff and not actually adding

543
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,240
load because

544
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,200
we only adapt when there's load maybe we

545
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,798
can get some

546
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,480
you know some proprioception or

547
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:37,359
awareness of position and other stuff

548
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,400
doing some some corrective patterns and

549
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,678
other stuff

550
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,400
but this is basic physiology

551
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,320
is that there must be an imposed demand

552
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,240
for us to have adaptation and this is

553
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:51,439
mental this is emotional this is

554
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,319
all these areas um but

555
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,600
and people miss that so i prefer to be

556
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,279
able to

557
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,038
look at a person and this is our

558
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:01,839
methodology and do the assessment

559
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,519
in any basic loaded movement so with

560
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,798
developing an eye for that you can

561
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:06,240
actually see and go

562
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:08,639
okay we've got a fault pattern right

563
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,160
here in the foot and use a queue or a

564
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,360
set of cues doesn't really matter until

565
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,960
we find the one that works

566
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,639
and bring that and now we know we want

567
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,919
to simplify this stuff i just walk

568
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,480
through that sounds really complicated

569
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,840
and it

570
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,599
it is if we try to break down and

571
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,199
distill it all but like let's just

572
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,199
find the basic stuff that gets us in the

573
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,960
range start working and then find the

574
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,120
next as we add load

575
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,880
now we find where's our next area that

576
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:30,239
we're starting to fault at and then go

577
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,760
there again next so

578
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:33,279
this is what we do what we teach in our

579
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,279
educational platform so we

580
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,839
are the only i believe everybody wants

581
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:40,160
to do a lot of these like

582
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:41,038
assessments you know on a bench on the

583
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,400
table body

584
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,919
and and it's like no let's let's go

585
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,919
squat let's go deadlift if you do

586
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,960
strongmen in a ceo carry let's go carry

587
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,960
because these are basic human

588
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,200
fundamentals it's not powerlifting

589
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,640
like this is how we function this is why

590
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,120
we we work with

591
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,000
29 of the 30 major league baseball teams

592
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:58,639
and

593
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,839
90 of all professional sports out there

594
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,200
in north america sorry

595
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:03,119
although we do some work with tour de

596
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,798
france and other stuff as well um

597
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:06,558
and uh north america i do mean hockey

598
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:09,359
too

599
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,000
but uh these principles like you know if

600
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:12,319
if the dodgers

601
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,038
won't bring us in they're not learning

602
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,359
how to

603
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:16,319
power lift you know we're gonna

604
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:18,719
obviously we'll probably

605
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:21,119
do we do a little bit more uh shoulder

606
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,720
focus than hip focus with their athletes

607
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:24,239
or their coaches we're usually working

608
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,960
with coaches not the athletes and so you

609
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,880
help them

610
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,319
and then the same thing on yourself and

611
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,000
to understand the role that these

612
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,798
different muscle groups have

613
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,279
yes on the holistic yeah so it's all

614
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:34,879
about

615
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,519
getting the joints in the appropriate

616
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,120
position so that we can

617
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,639
that we can manage loads so that we're

618
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:42,000
not putting undue stress in the joint

619
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,600
we're getting the proper length tension

620
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,200
we're getting these basic fundamental

621
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,678
things with the body and so

622
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,798
the the largest global impact that you

623
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,280
will have

624
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:52,720
is through spinal mechanics i can't look

625
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,399
at a shoulder

626
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,839
if i'm not managing this because it's

627
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,559
your spine so for those that are just

628
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,839
listening like

629
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:01,359
i'm arching and then and then flexing um

630
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:02,720
that's going to affect shoulder

631
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:03,759
extension flexion all these sorts of

632
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,519
things so

633
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,119
it could even affect things down what's

634
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,079
looking at dorsiflexion issues on the

635
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:09,599
foot like

636
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,279
and then that's why i go to the foot

637
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,719
next because it has the second largest

638
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:14,000
global impact

639
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,440
and then from there now i'm going to

640
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,400
look at the big energy drivers which is

641
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,960
the hip complex

642
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,640
shoulder complex and then we can start

643
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,079
looking at kind of the peripheral

644
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,679
things but usually that's some sort of

645
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:25,599
output of the other but

646
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,960
the knees the elbows the things like

647
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,719
that so it's all about

648
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,400
getting the stack which affects

649
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,519
neurology

650
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,159
so let's talk engineering terms you get

651
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:35,679
in a car

652
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,280
modern car today and a lot of them will

653
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,880
have this traction control button in

654
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,678
there and there's a big misconception

655
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,600
that

656
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,919
you know i'm i'm out and it's it's

657
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,038
snowier here in austin only rainy well

658
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,480
probably doesn't rain much but

659
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:47,599
you're going around a corner starts

660
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,720
slipping it's like oh it's going to send

661
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,599
the powers from the wheels that are

662
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
slipping through the ones that are

663
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,399
gripping

664
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,319
and keep me from crashing and dying a

665
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:56,159
fiery death

666
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:58,079
well that's not how it works it's the

667
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,400
exact same we've got we've got the

668
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,319
we've got the tires which are our foot

669
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,360
you know the connection to the ground

670
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:07,200
right we've got the power driver

671
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,719
which is you know the the engine the

672
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,720
transmission delivering

673
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,960
you know the power through it and we've

674
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,240
got the stability our suspension

675
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,079
and then we have the neurology

676
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,679
and what the neurology is doing it's

677
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,639
sensing

678
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:24,400
that we don't have good stability or

679
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,400
loss of connection somewhere

680
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,759
and so i need to save you from crashing

681
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,919
and hurting yourself

682
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,359
and so it goes to the engine and says

683
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,880
let's [ __ ] the timing

684
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,439
let's reduce the shift patterns and

685
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,120
we're just reducing the power output

686
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,519
and that's straight how the human body

687
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:41,839
works so when i do this stuff

688
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:43,279
it's actually affecting that i mean i

689
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:44,558
can take somebody and do some minute

690
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,759
changes with the neck

691
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:50,798
position at the thoracic outlet okay and

692
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,158
immediately see an enhancement in power

693
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:52,879
output and i can measure it we measure

694
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,760
this stuff

695
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,880
with uh velocity uh devices and see like

696
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,599
a 10

697
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,039
boom jump and so if you think about that

698
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:02,000
what about all your training through the

699
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,519
years

700
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,599
where you actually had additional

701
00:22:03,519 --> 00:22:07,839
capacity

702
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:09,678
but you weren't using it because your

703
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:10,959
traction control was on

704
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,360
now you figure this out stuff and now

705
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,400
you start stacking it now you can see

706
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,599
so much greater so it's not just injury

707
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,159
prevention

708
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,038
this is performance and additive

709
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,919
performance

710
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:26,079
over time this is huge and people don't

711
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,480
really think about this stuff

712
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:30,480
but we can turn that stuff off which is

713
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,079
actually going to also again make us

714
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,839
make us safer but what we want to do is

715
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:36,158
the performance tuned race car do they

716
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:38,798
have a traction control button

717
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
no they got some amazing tires to grip

718
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,440
the ground

719
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,798
a performance tuned suspension and that

720
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,480
driver is going to put what

721
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:47,038
his foot to the metal he's going to put

722
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,960
it to the floor

723
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,079
okay that's a performance vehicle that's

724
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,240
what we want to be

725
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,678
i want to continue on that line but

726
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,599
first i have to ask

727
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,720
like how did it feel to accomplish the

728
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,759
grand goal oh my god

729
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,640
okay when you just stand back oh

730
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,000
my thousand pounds for reps what it feel

731
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,038
like

732
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,319
anybody can go watch the video online

733
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:13,599
um 12 film by the way got me all

734
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,200
like excited oh well the the movies so

735
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:17,519
we actually have the final footage of

736
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,360
that the good footage not posted yet so

737
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:21,279
it's literally just an instagram video

738
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,719
or a phone video right now the only one

739
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:24,079
online yeah

740
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,240
it's on your youtube channel but it's

741
00:23:24,079 --> 00:23:28,079
dramatic yes it is yeah it came out just

742
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,079
time to the music perfectly too

743
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,599
which is i listened to some odd music uh

744
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:36,079
which there's some reason behind that

745
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:38,959
okay um but um

746
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,359
fooling footage there's a documentary

747
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,720
that's

748
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:43,278
it's got a little slowed because of

749
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,759
kovit because it's also a backstory of

750
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:46,720
the eagle and the dragon my book about

751
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,400
why i do

752
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,240
kind of the things that i've done in my

753
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:51,600
life or that's what i'm assuming the

754
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,159
director is working on i don't really

755
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:55,599
have

756
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,600
the control of the movie right

757
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:59,839
but okay but the videos okay incredible

758
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,200
how did it feel how'd it feel

759
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:07,119
i started crying it was overwhelming

760
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,200
to have worked so intensely and so long

761
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,000
and hard at something that

762
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,278
pushed every ounce of me to the limit

763
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,919
that

764
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:18,000
and and i did it i'm getting a little

765
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,679
emotional i did exactly what i said i

766
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,038
was going to [ __ ] do

767
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,720
like and it was it was

768
00:24:23,038 --> 00:24:27,440
overpowering i mean i was just crying

769
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:32,079
uncontrollably

770
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:34,000
um just with a mixture of i i don't

771
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:35,599
know what th the mixture of emotions is

772
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,038
hard to explain

773
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:40,879
um because it was

774
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,319
the completion of something it was a new

775
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,200
phase of my

776
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,960
i i mean there's so many things here so

777
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,640
one you set an impossible goal and you

778
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,278
accomplished it one

779
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,240
two is like on the broader humanity

780
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,079
aspect

781
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,720
like how many humans in this world

782
00:24:54,079 --> 00:25:00,240
accomplish

783
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,839
perfection in a particular direction

784
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,679
required to do this so like you're

785
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:06,798
basically representing

786
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,759
like uh one little like like little

787
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,639
glimmer

788
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,158
of excellence of the human spirit

789
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,759
there's always more

790
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,640
so understand this this is a basic

791
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:18,640
fundamental

792
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,320
you can always do better there is no

793
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,440
such thing as perfection you could

794
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,000
always

795
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,558
there is always more so any time you

796
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,720
reach something

797
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:27,599
any amazing workout or accomplishment in

798
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,038
life

799
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,278
could you have put more into it could

800
00:25:29,038 --> 00:25:36,558
even yes but

801
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:36,558
here's the thing i left on my terms

802
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,200
i said this is it i'm going to work

803
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:43,759
towards i've been training for 30

804
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,720
years i'm gonna do this thing that is un

805
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:48,158
like i couldn't even

806
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:51,360
say that i was gonna do it years before

807
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,200
i'm gonna do it and then i'm done

808
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,759
and i didn't leave from an injury i

809
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,798
wasn't forced to i wasn't

810
00:25:55,759 --> 00:26:01,759
i left on i did exactly what i said i i

811
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:01,759
went to a level that i

812
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:06,959
i left on my terms and that's unique

813
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:09,360
because that's usually not the case

814
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,079
usually you kind of either taper out or

815
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,839
it doesn't matter

816
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:13,278
i'm talking like anything in life in

817
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:16,319
general right like

818
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,359
um you taper out you fail you hurt like

819
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:20,000
you look you lose it

820
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,000
like something you know you roll into

821
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,919
retirement like

822
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,679
you accomplished something truly great

823
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:29,120
and you walked away in your own terms

824
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,080
is there a sadness completing something

825
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,199
like that

826
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,519
because it's it's in one

827
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,960
perspective the greatest thing you'll

828
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:39,200
ever do

829
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,558
and like when you accomplish such a

830
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,319
great height

831
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:44,319
in some sense you have to face your

832
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:47,278
mortality at that point

833
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:49,278
so good question but it is certainly not

834
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,400
the greatest thing that i'll ever do

835
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:52,720
it's the greatest physical there's

836
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,080
always dude the greatest

837
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,200
yes but

838
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,759
that was an expression of some of my

839
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,080
values

840
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:03,519
and the way that i want to live it was a

841
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:06,720
way of expressing it so

842
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:10,798
understanding that is hugely fundamental

843
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,960
because we do see so many athletes

844
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:14,639
get to the end of a career and then they

845
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,120
fall into

846
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,679
a depressive state and struggle with

847
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:20,959
drugs

848
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,278
alcohol depression so on because they

849
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,720
lost how they identified themself and

850
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:25,599
trying to figure out where to turn what

851
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,919
to do but a

852
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:29,278
big central component of their identity

853
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:32,720
is lost

854
00:27:29,278 --> 00:27:35,038
so i

855
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,960
knew that this was one way to express

856
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:39,679
that and my grand goals

857
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,679
have shifted they're shifted to other

858
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,880
outlets that allow me to express that

859
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,440
like my companies

860
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,039
kabuki strength i'm going to change the

861
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,519
face of fitness

862
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,359
as well as all the way through with its

863
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:52,240
integration with clinical medicine and

864
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:54,079
telemedicine

865
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,519
and you know i got another five years

866
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,720
before even people see what i'm working

867
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,359
on five years in right now because i had

868
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,798
to invent

869
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,719
equipment i have to develop

870
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,639
methodologies that were talking i had to

871
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,120
do this stuff that ground layer wasn't

872
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,399
done

873
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:08,158
to create a cohesive ecosystem of

874
00:28:06,398 --> 00:28:09,359
training methodology tied to the tools

875
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,799
that we're using today to the

876
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:13,119
environment tied to the clinical

877
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:15,440
practice assessment tied to the

878
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:17,119
the interaction between all those and

879
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,278
how that actually needs to be reframed

880
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:24,558
because so much of this is broken okay

881
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:27,599
so but there is sadness

882
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,480
i won't deny that and the sadness comes

883
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:32,240
in

884
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:35,278
the singularity of focus

885
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:37,759
that i had at that time the being

886
00:28:35,278 --> 00:28:38,880
in the process not necessarily doing but

887
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,839
like

888
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,520
having being in this place that the rest

889
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,439
of the world kind of fell away for me in

890
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:48,079
those final faces to have something

891
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,960
so intense to have a team around me so

892
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,480
focused on supporting and like

893
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,720
it took me a couple months after that

894
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,839
squad i finally one day i woke up and i

895
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,000
was like

896
00:28:56,839 --> 00:29:01,278
oh welcome back to the world like i was

897
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,960
in such a mental

898
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:05,359
fog like i was it took me a while to

899
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,919
climb

900
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:10,319
out of that but that that space that

901
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:14,000
level of intensity and driving

902
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:16,798
and living and being in that space

903
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,960
i i do miss that but i also i can't

904
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:20,798
continue that i couldn't contin like

905
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,399
there's a point of like you push it so

906
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:24,319
hard

907
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:25,678
the level to try to go from there is not

908
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:26,960
acceptable for what you

909
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,080
the impacts that will have on your life

910
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,120
for how you want to live and it was

911
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:31,839
taking away

912
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:33,839
those final like i had to do extreme

913
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:36,079
things and live in an extreme way to

914
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,158
to get there you're just a genius in

915
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:38,879
this whole space of strength and health

916
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,159
and by

917
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:43,840
almost like biology that uh

918
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,278
this strength feat is just one

919
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:47,278
representation of that

920
00:29:45,278 --> 00:29:49,038
but this particular strength required

921
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:52,319
that kind of singular focus

922
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:54,000
which i think i don't know there's

923
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,038
something beautiful about that singular

924
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,599
focus there is often only

925
00:29:57,038 --> 00:30:01,759
truly perfected athletics i see it with

926
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:03,439
the greatest olympic athletes as well

927
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,960
the kind of singular focus required

928
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,399
there is incredible it's

929
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:10,880
somehow some of the most beautiful

930
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,678
things that humans can do and achieve

931
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,799
just that thing

932
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,720
so that's the thing it's like oh that

933
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:15,519
must be it when we say singularity focus

934
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,319
it's not like

935
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,240
here's it because it it covers a vast

936
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:23,359
array of stuff like

937
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,839
i was working with people you know

938
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,199
all well yeah all around north america i

939
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:29,038
wouldn't say anybody around the globe

940
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,558
but professionals coming in working on

941
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:34,079
different aspects of rehab

942
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:35,759
and and recovery and like i mean i'm

943
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,599
tapping all sorts of stuff

944
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:42,640
in so many platforms from nutrition

945
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:45,278
to drugs to uh again

946
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,159
like you know various uh chinese

947
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:47,919
medicine

948
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,000
you know as far as you know but also

949
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,640
humans in your life just love and

950
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,919
and uh positivity and just inspiration

951
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,919
all those kinds of aspects

952
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,120
i mean you probably would have done much

953
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,880
more if you

954
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,278
uh went outside north america and talked

955
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,559
to some russians just between you and i

956
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,359
some russians possibly they give you

957
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:06,960
some uh

958
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,719
i don't know those there's some

959
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,519
incredible strength athletes in eastern

960
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,159
europe uh

961
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,640
absolutely um i've got the best one uh

962
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,760
coming

963
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,880
in september uh to get fixed so what do

964
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,079
you mean by fixed

965
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,240
so i'm not sure what his particular

966
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:21,918
issues are but uh he

967
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,440
has held the all-time world record

968
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,960
repeatedly for a long time

969
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,798
and uh he hasn't competed for some time

970
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,558
and he just reached out saying

971
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:30,480
he would like to come and have me take a

972
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:31,678
look and see if i can get him fixed

973
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,839
because the return

974
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,200
yes okay so it's more injury centric

975
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:37,599
versus like form

976
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,558
and uh fundamental essential combination

977
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,918
of everything

978
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:41,440
everybody always wants to focus on the

979
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,720
output how do you how do you give me the

980
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:44,880
fix for that but

981
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,240
it ties right back into all those other

982
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,720
things right

983
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,278
so uh but yeah the eastern the eastern

984
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,600
bloc

985
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:52,558
continued to be a dominant force uh in

986
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:54,480
regards to

987
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,839
uh athletics and strength athletes

988
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,679
without a doubt

989
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:59,678
some of my big rivals in my competitive

990
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,480
days were

991
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,278
who it was rivalry brings out the best

992
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,319
in us

993
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,480
can you tell me the story of your

994
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:07,599
childhood it's definitely outside the

995
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,000
scope of the norm

996
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,879
well today maybe not 150 or 200 years

997
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,079
ago

998
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,919
but uh my parents

999
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:18,798
highly intelligent you know people

1000
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,200
coming out of the bay area

1001
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,278
my mom was you know going to school to

1002
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,440
be a chemical engineer she was a top

1003
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:28,000
top student athlete graduated of her

1004
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,399
school my father was a member of mensah

1005
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,319
my stepfather was just a genius but not

1006
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:34,079
able to really function in society

1007
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,398
but my mom was you know she had some

1008
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,480
demons and some other stuff and just

1009
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:40,639
she just said one day she's like i just

1010
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,679
don't want to be part of society

1011
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,320
she still isn't uh lives out in the

1012
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:49,278
desert but uh has her minds but

1013
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,000
she wanted to figure out a way to make a

1014
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:52,798
life

1015
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,440
outside of that and so that's where we

1016
00:32:52,798 --> 00:32:55,359
ended up

1017
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,759
is up in the mountains in northern

1018
00:32:55,359 --> 00:33:00,240
california and

1019
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,440
a lot of that was you know them trying

1020
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,399
to

1021
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,880
get into successfully growing marijuana

1022
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:06,398
which

1023
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,919
back in that you know wasn't legal back

1024
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:09,839
then highly illegal

1025
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,120
and in fact those areas where some of

1026
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,759
the areas where lived were quite

1027
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:16,079
dangerous so there's a documentary

1028
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:16,879
murder mountain that came out recently

1029
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,079
if you watch that

1030
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,519
you'll tie into my book uh just the

1031
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,960
understanding of

1032
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,599
the stuff that i was talking about

1033
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,720
dealing with serial killers

1034
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:32,000
human trafficking police corruption

1035
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,839
uh murderers like just

1036
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,119
how real that stuff is if it doesn't

1037
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,798
capture you from the book

1038
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:39,759
okay the book by the way is the eagle

1039
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,119
and the dragon yeah thank you

1040
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:44,158
yeah it's a great i'm a terrible sales

1041
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:46,079
person like i told you so

1042
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,760
but a good uh it's a good title i don't

1043
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,918
know if you came up with it but uh

1044
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,558
i did yeah so yeah we'll talk about that

1045
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,640
anyway we're living by a stream

1046
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,720
you know alpha meadow there's no roads

1047
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,320
into where you have to hike in

1048
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,000
and we've got beams lashed into the

1049
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,960
trees up above us because that's where

1050
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,079
our bedding is because there's

1051
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:06,399
rattlesnake dens

1052
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:07,119
all around and six years old i'm being

1053
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:09,440
taught

1054
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:10,480
how to capture and handle live

1055
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,320
rattlesnakes

1056
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,960
because that's what i need to do to be

1057
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,399
safe and you can imagine six years old

1058
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,679
sitting there with a live rattlesnake in

1059
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:19,679
your hand grabbing it you know by the

1060
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,838
side of the head controlling so it can't

1061
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,599
can't bite you and it's just wrapping

1062
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,398
itself around your arm and

1063
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,200
you're staring like it's only intent is

1064
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:31,358
right then is

1065
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:33,039
to kill you like that's it right um

1066
00:34:31,358 --> 00:34:34,559
you want to take a bath it's filling up

1067
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,159
the jug in the stream and setting it out

1068
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,679
on the rockster and uh

1069
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,519
during the sun so you dump it over your

1070
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,480
head and you know not all the living was

1071
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:42,800
that way

1072
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,079
you know good part was similar to that

1073
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,159
tent living

1074
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,200
living in a 16 foot trailer with a

1075
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,519
family of six

1076
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,678
which is not much bigger than the space

1077
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,759
that we're sitting here

1078
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,398
so we're talking hard winters with feet

1079
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,160
of snow on the ground nowhere to go

1080
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:59,519
i'm living in the back of the pickup

1081
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,199
truck in a

1082
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,880
just a standard sleeping bag that we get

1083
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:06,000
from the salvation army not the

1084
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,039
not the blow zero so i'm uh i'm i'm not

1085
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,838
sleeping well

1086
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,239
there's living in homes that were maybe

1087
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,480
uh

1088
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,959
condemned there's no no doors even on

1089
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,240
them no electricity or running water or

1090
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,760
one or the other or both

1091
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,078
and sometimes a little bit better by the

1092
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,960
time we got to high school

1093
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,240
we had a mobile home so my stepfather

1094
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,079
had won a disability payment because he

1095
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:28,879
had a broken arm that whole time

1096
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,760
from an accident a long time ago and

1097
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,680
finally got

1098
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,280
an award and got a down payment on this

1099
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,118
mobile home that

1100
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,160
didn't have again doors on the inside it

1101
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,240
did have running water did have

1102
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:40,159
electricity didn't have a kitchen

1103
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:41,759
you know the windows would crank close

1104
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:42,799
and open but they wouldn't close all the

1105
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,960
way so the

1106
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,440
trim them in with uh plastic to be able

1107
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,519
to try to protect from the elements

1108
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,599
that was my environment like learning

1109
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,199
how to forage for mushrooms i mean

1110
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,039
there's summers i would send

1111
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:57,199
and my parents would be out they were in

1112
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,159
the drug trade earlier we got taken by

1113
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,838
the

1114
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:04,960
by the police and put into

1115
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,960
foster care for for a while which

1116
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,159
ties into some of the stories with human

1117
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,920
trafficking and honestly

1118
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:11,358
it's in my book but it's really hard for

1119
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,800
me to

1120
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:16,559
talk about that stuff um

1121
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,240
and obviously not all that's in the book

1122
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,039
so but

1123
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,399
they got us back we moved to oregon and

1124
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:23,199
they stayed out of the drug trade from

1125
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,559
that time

1126
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,159
to ensure that they didn't lose us again

1127
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,239
but quickly we kind of fell back into

1128
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,078
the same thing so at that point it was

1129
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:33,519
learning about geology and starting to

1130
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:37,200
do mining

1131
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:39,039
and firewood cutting but mostly

1132
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:40,480
mining because pat's broken arm chainsaw

1133
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,320
made a little tough

1134
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,920
if you remember just the sequence of

1135
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,559
moments do you

1136
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,079
um are you haunted by the the darker

1137
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:52,159
moments of your childhood

1138
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:55,920
do you remember moments of simple joy

1139
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:57,598
and happiness outside of the

1140
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,000
living around dangerous people and the

1141
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,800
interactions that came from that

1142
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,880
we were a family like we were a cohesive

1143
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,079
unit battling against the world together

1144
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,358
we spent all our time together

1145
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,720
work play i was there i was helping

1146
00:37:11,358 --> 00:37:15,598
raise my my siblings

1147
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,879
where i was working with them and you

1148
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,480
know it was a constant

1149
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,400
like i said we were very physically

1150
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,000
active so you know i had that in my

1151
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,920
upbringing

1152
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,280
plugged for my shoe company barefoot

1153
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,639
b-e-a-r

1154
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,440
i ran around the wilderness and bare

1155
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:32,319
feet all the time you know but it was

1156
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,480
i had a lot of great moments and i'm

1157
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,160
thankful for a lot of that childhood

1158
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,079
once we take out the trauma

1159
00:37:36,159 --> 00:37:39,519
and the other stuff associated with it

1160
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,320
right

1161
00:37:39,519 --> 00:37:43,519
and so the connection that i have with

1162
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,960
my sisters

1163
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:48,960
um is is is huge um that goes a bit

1164
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,800
further to because i am kind of like a

1165
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,639
little bit of a father figure because

1166
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,240
i was home raising them and then later i

1167
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:55,679
took custody of them

1168
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,759
while i was going to school because the

1169
00:37:55,679 --> 00:38:01,039
environment at home deteriorated further

1170
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,760
their stepfather like i said was

1171
00:38:01,039 --> 00:38:05,599
he wasn't capable of managing life and

1172
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,560
my mom had a mental breakdown and took

1173
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,320
off to montana

1174
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:13,199
and he descended into madness even worse

1175
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,480
actually took my 13 year old sister and

1176
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,000
kicked her out in the middle of winter

1177
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,838
a couple feet of snow on the ground

1178
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,559
because he thought she stole his

1179
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:23,838
favorite cereal bowl

1180
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:25,519
um type so that's when i took in and

1181
00:38:23,838 --> 00:38:27,039
i was going to college putting myself

1182
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,400
through college and i started taking

1183
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:28,960
custody of my sisters and raising them

1184
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,720
so

1185
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:35,679
anyway but we're still like very

1186
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,199
very tight family um it took there was a

1187
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,759
few years later

1188
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:40,480
in life like that the connection with my

1189
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,960
mother was

1190
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,000
kind of broken um i didn't speak to her

1191
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,800
for years because

1192
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,480
of her basically abandoning my sisters

1193
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,240
and me having to come in but

1194
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:51,599
that we've worked through that as best

1195
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:54,959
we can so you

1196
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,119
anger on your part it wasn't

1197
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,320
there might have been some anger um did

1198
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,720
you always love her

1199
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,079
yes and i still do and i'm so she's

1200
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,239
taught me

1201
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:07,680
basically everything i know about

1202
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:10,399
strength and perseverance and

1203
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,719
living life on your terms and being able

1204
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,920
to

1205
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:15,039
to create that and so much of what i am

1206
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,358
is from that

1207
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,358
right we've all had to learn to

1208
00:39:19,519 --> 00:39:23,199
be okay with the way she is because she

1209
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:27,119
is just

1210
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:29,118
blunt but you know she's the one that

1211
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,240
figured out that the human trafficking

1212
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,519
situation and

1213
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:35,759
got uh got the da involved and got all

1214
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:35,759
the

1215
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,639
she's the one that

1216
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:44,159
i've learned a lot from her and uh did

1217
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,039
you inherit some of the demons

1218
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,799
almost certainly and i it's something

1219
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,079
i've continued like

1220
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,519
and my father's side of has been really

1221
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,160
tough on that because some of it is

1222
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,119
just based genetic as well so my my

1223
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,118
stepfather made

1224
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,760
i think six or seven attempts on his

1225
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,559
life during his lifetime

1226
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,200
one of those in front of me uh his

1227
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,838
mother

1228
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:10,639
blew her head off with a shotgun uh her

1229
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:13,119
brother jumped out a window in l.a

1230
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,639
their father did something similar and i

1231
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,800
don't know how far back it goes

1232
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:18,318
because there is no family except for me

1233
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,880
and my my children

1234
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:21,519
you spoke about going to depression

1235
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,200
yourself

1236
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:28,639
yeah can you um talk about some of the

1237
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:30,480
darker moments of that have you ever

1238
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:33,440
like many in your family have you ever

1239
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:36,960
considered suicide yes i have

1240
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:39,440
yes i have you've achieved a lot of

1241
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,679
exceptional things in your life

1242
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,559
can you talk about those early days of

1243
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:46,480
depression

1244
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:49,679
and how you overcame it yeah

1245
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,000
so the things that i did that people

1246
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:53,358
give me accolades for are the things

1247
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,480
that i did selfishly

1248
00:40:53,358 --> 00:40:59,759
to save myself the things like

1249
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,358
taking custody of my sisters being the

1250
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,400
person

1251
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:06,480
that everybody around you know the the

1252
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:07,838
important people relied on the fact that

1253
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,719
i had to

1254
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:12,880
step to the plate and be present and be

1255
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:16,399
that person

1256
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,400
because if i failed

1257
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,000
they failed they would be like the

1258
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,680
people that i grew up with

1259
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,679
that are dead or in prison

1260
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,280
or on drugs and they're either way to to

1261
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:32,000
one of those

1262
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,760
right that's where everybody ended and i

1263
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,119
wasn't gonna let that happen

1264
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:39,119
what about saving yourself and so that's

1265
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,720
how in those early days that's how i did

1266
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,440
it not saying it's the best approach but

1267
00:41:40,719 --> 00:41:45,759
it was survivor mentality it was

1268
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:48,480
i can't selfishly do that because i have

1269
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,200
them to take care of

1270
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,639
right and then that continued where i

1271
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,000
would keep putting myself in these

1272
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:55,118
leadership roles or other things and

1273
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,480
this always being

1274
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:02,400
this person that was

1275
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:05,760
at the center at the hub that

1276
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,720
forced me to be there and so it's only

1277
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:10,640
in the more recent you know last decade

1278
00:42:08,719 --> 00:42:13,679
or so that i have had to really

1279
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:16,559
learn how to come and start confronting

1280
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:19,440
some of those demons and you think man

1281
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:20,400
why is the guy so successful like i mean

1282
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,639
and we haven't talked about all the

1283
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,838
stuff that i've done but like

1284
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:29,279
i've seen a lot of success in both

1285
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:32,880
business leadership athletics

1286
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,160
academics uh entrepreneurship all these

1287
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,960
sorts of things right

1288
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,838
but if it wasn't for you know having

1289
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,519
kids

1290
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:41,679
and the same being in the position i

1291
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:44,800
wouldn't be here

1292
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,279
if it and that's just that's the reality

1293
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,960
of it

1294
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,440
and i'm learning to to come

1295
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,159
and manage those as best i can learning

1296
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,400
to

1297
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,480
meditate into those things and really

1298
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,280
feel what the driver is so i can get to

1299
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,760
those

1300
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,680
those root understanding um and and

1301
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,359
having some guidance doing so like

1302
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,879
if you've got mental health issues this

1303
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:05,679
isn't something that you need to tackle

1304
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,599
on your own

1305
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:10,078
like having a professional that can help

1306
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,280
guide you on that introspective journey

1307
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,960
is is something like

1308
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,440
it's not like hey i'm big tough guy i

1309
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,480
can handle everything

1310
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:24,318
you know that's fascinating that um

1311
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:27,358
you saved yourself that's quite

1312
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:29,759
powerful to save yourself by uh having

1313
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:32,559
others depend on you and so you can't

1314
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:34,240
fail you can't [ __ ] it up and that's a

1315
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,358
reason to keep

1316
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:39,039
moving forward but on the flip side

1317
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:42,078
that's not

1318
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:44,639
addressing the darkness it's not and

1319
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,920
it's probably not a sustainable strategy

1320
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,318
either right so i i

1321
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,920
recognize these things i don't know and

1322
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,759
uh

1323
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,400
perhaps it is sustainable perhaps that's

1324
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,839
i mean there's something beautiful about

1325
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,880
giving yourself basically in service of

1326
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:02,639
others

1327
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,000
and thereby creating purpose

1328
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,000
and then like it's almost like fake it

1329
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,880
till you make it and then you make it

1330
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,679
eventually

1331
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,200
that is purpose though that is purpose i

1332
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:14,960
mean you have to

1333
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:16,879
to me life is about

1334
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:19,119
taking your cup and how you choose to

1335
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:21,200
pour it out how you choose to give

1336
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,880
what is your purpose what is that

1337
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:24,559
connection with everybody around you

1338
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,720
this is

1339
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:28,559
that's that's the intent that's the life

1340
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:30,719
that's that's what life is about

1341
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,920
how are you going to help those around

1342
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:32,318
you how are you going to help the world

1343
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,480
you know

1344
00:44:32,318 --> 00:44:35,358
your purposes is right here figuring out

1345
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,000
what this is

1346
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:38,880
and then how to do that but at the same

1347
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,960
time

1348
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:42,400
you can't let that run dry so you have

1349
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:43,440
to make sure

1350
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,240
right that you're filling that's the

1351
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:48,800
other side that's the other side right

1352
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,639
that's the other side yeah we'll return

1353
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,160
to your engineering degree which

1354
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:55,199
you're obviously scientifically

1355
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:56,879
engineering-minded which is fascinating

1356
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:58,318
your book is titled the eagle and the

1357
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,480
dragon

1358
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,079
uh what do the eagle and the dragon

1359
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,920
symbolize

1360
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,920
they're pretty big symbols for me in

1361
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:08,639
fact that covers my entire body

1362
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,519
as a tattoo so the first one i had done

1363
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:12,480
is around

1364
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:13,759
19 years old and so this is or started

1365
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,800
at 19.

1366
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,359
uh it's an uh an eagle that covers my

1367
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,480
entire

1368
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:22,000
front you know my stomach rib cage and

1369
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:24,400
and one that was on my back that covered

1370
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:28,639
most of my back and there's

1371
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,318
chained at the well at the claw i guess

1372
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:32,400
and the chain wraps down around and

1373
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:33,440
attaches to to my ankle and there's a

1374
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,440
shackle there

1375
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:37,119
and so this was something that i had

1376
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:41,519
done at that age because it was

1377
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:43,760
to me it was a representation of

1378
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,519
your potential your strengths your

1379
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,440
abilities that you can fly

1380
00:45:45,519 --> 00:45:48,559
to whatever height that you want in this

1381
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,240
world

1382
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,960
the only thing holding you back at the

1383
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:55,759
end of the day is yourself

1384
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,358
and this was that's i hadn't necessarily

1385
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,920
accomplished a whole lot that time i

1386
00:45:57,358 --> 00:46:00,400
mean i was

1387
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,838
valedictorian for high school small high

1388
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,119
school

1389
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:06,559
does that even count uh as a state level

1390
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,838
wrestler

1391
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:11,199
this was my belief and you sensed that

1392
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,279
there was a potential in you

1393
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,719
and the only thing that could stop you

1394
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,280
from realizing that potential

1395
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:18,318
was yourself that's right that's a heck

1396
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,920
of a tattoo

1397
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:21,920
to get by the way at 19 but

1398
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,159
40 hours went into that thing it shows

1399
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,400
you got some guts

1400
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:34,358
and then the next tattoo so i only have

1401
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:36,960
two uh i had done in

1402
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:40,078
2015 2016

1403
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,599
uh when i so at this point in my life

1404
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,000
so i had done that i had flown to

1405
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,440
whatever heights right so i had

1406
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:50,000
i had proven to myself and and maybe

1407
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,200
done what i thought i needed to do to

1408
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,318
show the world that

1409
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,838
this poor kid from the sticks this

1410
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:58,318
this kid growing up in the mountains

1411
00:46:55,838 --> 00:46:59,199
with nothing could achieve the american

1412
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,318
dream

1413
00:46:59,199 --> 00:47:05,358
i was a corporate executive sought after

1414
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:07,119
that i'd come in i'd fix companies i'd

1415
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:09,279
turn around and prep them for sale

1416
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,039
i'd take a company and grow it from a

1417
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,560
regional to a national to a global

1418
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:14,719
presence i did this in the

1419
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:18,000
automotive manufacturing aerospace

1420
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:20,480
manufacturing high tech heavy industry

1421
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,358
and i had a house with a white picket

1422
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,480
fence

1423
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:26,239
i was a successful athlete with all-time

1424
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,000
world records i owned a gym on the side

1425
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:32,479
where i coached people

1426
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,639
and uh had a comfortable marriage

1427
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,039
that everything was hunky-dory with no

1428
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:40,719
arguments at home

1429
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:43,199
and uh i walked away from all of it

1430
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:45,118
i left everything behind except for my

1431
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:49,039
kids

1432
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:52,960
i wanted

1433
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:56,239
to chase what i was meant to do

1434
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:59,199
and chase what i was capable of doing

1435
00:47:56,239 --> 00:48:00,000
i wanted to become a better version of

1436
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:03,279
myself but

1437
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,280
very intentfully

1438
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:11,760
and that's what i did i

1439
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,760
sold i had multiple homes sold my homes

1440
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:17,200
i cashed in all my retirement that i'd

1441
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:20,558
earned for 20 nearly 20 years

1442
00:48:17,199 --> 00:48:22,879
and i lost all that i leveraged myself

1443
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,680
millions of dollars of personal debt so

1444
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:26,400
that if i

1445
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:28,719
failed there was no way out even going

1446
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,559
back to that old career that i did well

1447
00:48:28,719 --> 00:48:33,199
i'd be living in an apartment the rest

1448
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:34,559
of my life paying it off

1449
00:48:33,199 --> 00:48:36,318
people questioned people questioned me

1450
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,319
at the time because i had a comfortable

1451
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:42,639
easy marriage

1452
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:45,039
and i chose to ask for a divorce

1453
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,400
and i ended up living in an apartment

1454
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,519
for a couple years with

1455
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:51,200
no income selling off every last thing

1456
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:52,639
that i had except for my two vehicles

1457
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:56,000
that i built

1458
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:59,279
and with my with my kids

1459
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,599
and i've started my businesses

1460
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:02,400
to help people live a better quality of

1461
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,400
life

1462
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,440
to get them out of pain to help them

1463
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:09,440
live better

1464
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:11,519
through strength to realize that

1465
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,720
stress demand those things that they

1466
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,440
don't have to be the thing

1467
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,078
that if you look back made you had the

1468
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,679
bad back

1469
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,119
made you have the bad ds but they do the

1470
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,199
opposite they get you out of pain and

1471
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:23,039
then i started work on my book to

1472
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:24,558
to to hit on those other things the

1473
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:26,960
mental the emotional

1474
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:28,240
maybe even spiritual i don't touch on

1475
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,000
that one too much in there but

1476
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:34,479
it's all the same that

1477
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:36,079
things that happen around you to you

1478
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,400
like maybe they're bad

1479
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,079
i can't take away that but why can't you

1480
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,240
use what you have of it

1481
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,318
to become a stronger and better person

1482
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:46,078
to become more resilient to be able to

1483
00:49:44,318 --> 00:49:47,519
take the things that you don't know that

1484
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:49,760
are coming in the future

1485
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:51,039
and so this is very intentful and that's

1486
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,319
what the second

1487
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,239
i'm long-winded to answer in your

1488
00:49:52,318 --> 00:49:56,960
question here the dragon the dragon

1489
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:59,759
the dragon is an aura boris and so yeah

1490
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:01,599
it is it circles my entire upper body my

1491
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,839
shoulders my back my chest everything

1492
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,240
it's

1493
00:50:01,838 --> 00:50:06,000
right here there's this big dragon head

1494
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,838
and its tail is right there in its mouth

1495
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,400
that's eating itself

1496
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,519
and that may sound a bit graphic or

1497
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,480
whatever but it is

1498
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:16,000
it's the eating of the old becoming the

1499
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,159
new it is

1500
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:20,000
the purposeful reinvention of oneself it

1501
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,318
is the deciding

1502
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,880
not realizing just your potential but

1503
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:26,800
deciding specifically who you want to be

1504
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,160
in this [ __ ] world

1505
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:34,480
and becoming that person can you comment

1506
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:38,558
on the the value and the power of

1507
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:40,880
putting a flame to you know

1508
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:43,200
your old life your old self just

1509
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,920
destroying all of it

1510
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:47,759
as you walk into the new life you know

1511
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:50,000
did you have to do that

1512
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,480
i don't recommend this by the way

1513
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:52,800
because when you put yourself in no way

1514
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:57,280
out

1515
00:50:52,800 --> 00:51:00,800
there is no way out yeah okay like

1516
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,480
you gotta really no

1517
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,720
but i i can be an overconfident

1518
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,079
individual at times and uh

1519
00:51:04,719 --> 00:51:08,639
i live i live through extremes i think

1520
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:11,839
it's a

1521
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:14,400
great way of actually finding your real

1522
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:17,920
values and how you want to live honestly

1523
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,680
to chase the having absolutely perfect

1524
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,200
squat technique but chase putting

1525
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,039
every freaking thing that you've got in

1526
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:24,159
it which most people would say those are

1527
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:27,039
those are opposite those are

1528
00:51:24,159 --> 00:51:30,558
diametrically opposed

1529
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:32,159
i wanted a better home life

1530
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,400
i wanted to do more in the world through

1531
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:37,838
my work

1532
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:39,440
and the burning the bridges mentality is

1533
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,318
not necessarily

1534
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,960
you know the the best there was some

1535
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:46,000
temperament

1536
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,838
in that though because i i was not i was

1537
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,159
slow to make the shift for a long time

1538
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,519
because i'd been thinking about doing it

1539
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:52,960
but i was thinking about doing it in a

1540
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:54,559
healthcare perspective i'm gonna go back

1541
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,400
to school to be a surgeon or a physical

1542
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,079
therapist or cairo because that's where

1543
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,680
like all my research and stuff was in

1544
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,800
this this human movement

1545
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:04,480
and rehab and recovery this is the

1546
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,640
mentors that i've been developing were

1547
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,318
the best in the world in these things

1548
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,078
in these disciplines those were my

1549
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:13,838
friends and

1550
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:15,920
and uh but i wasn't able to compromise

1551
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:17,279
my family's certain quality of life i

1552
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,880
wanted to to keep this it was

1553
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:22,079
it was slow and hard for me to make that

1554
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,240
transition but i didn't do it until

1555
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:25,280
i had a platform built enough that those

1556
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:27,118
first few years

1557
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,559
i did have an income i was able to make

1558
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,838
enough from the business until it grew

1559
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:31,519
so fast

1560
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:33,279
that i needed so much more needed to

1561
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:34,400
come in living in the apartment piece

1562
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:35,200
and doing all that that was actually a

1563
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:38,318
couple years

1564
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:39,598
into uh into that process maybe like two

1565
00:52:38,318 --> 00:52:41,679
years

1566
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:44,160
uh i'm with you on that so i'm actually

1567
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:47,039
going through that very process now

1568
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,719
i put everything i quit everything gave

1569
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,920
away everything and starting

1570
00:52:48,719 --> 00:52:52,879
new and uh unfortunately or fortunately

1571
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:56,720
this podcast

1572
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:58,559
somehow became quite um popular

1573
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:01,199
so it's getting in in the way of my

1574
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:04,079
burning everything to the ground

1575
00:53:01,199 --> 00:53:05,279
but in that it's a source of joy but the

1576
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:07,760
main thing i'm after

1577
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,680
is the similar project as you as

1578
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:12,800
building a business

1579
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:14,318
sense of joy so this this is the point i

1580
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,800
want to drive home right now

1581
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,239
right now because when i say burn i

1582
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,000
learned the burning the bridges works

1583
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:22,799
because

1584
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,599
that's how i had to succeed when i was

1585
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,119
earlier

1586
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:27,599
the bridges weren't burnt they didn't

1587
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,838
exist there was no couch to go home to

1588
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,440
there was no there was no fallback plan

1589
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:32,960
and it forced me and gave me the

1590
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,480
confidence to know that i can pull it

1591
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,280
off

1592
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:39,199
but i don't encourage people because

1593
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,640
there's so much out there of this hustle

1594
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,480
porn and other stuff going

1595
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:43,920
just grind just go after it get in and

1596
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,159
start your like

1597
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,400
you'll get there and it's all about the

1598
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:48,960
output to make money to be somebody to

1599
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:50,960
do this

1600
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,039
and i'll tell you what that is some

1601
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:55,039
short-term motivation right there i feel

1602
00:53:53,039 --> 00:53:58,480
like dropping a few swear words but

1603
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:00,079
um you're always welcome

1604
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,199
we've already done a few so we'll uh all

1605
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,200
right balance it out

1606
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,720
that is short term that is not going to

1607
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:08,400
keep you going

1608
00:54:06,719 --> 00:54:10,159
this neat if you're going to go that

1609
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,880
approach it needs to be because

1610
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:13,199
this is your north star there's going to

1611
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:14,960
be

1612
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:16,639
so much hard work there's going to be

1613
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:18,400
years of just

1614
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,400
pushing through where your quest not

1615
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,760
only is everybody around you questioning

1616
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,760
you and your family is questioning you

1617
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,520
you're questioning yourself going man i

1618
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,800
don't know if i can pull this off

1619
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:28,800
you're going to be stressed you're going

1620
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,240
to be pulled to the max if somebody

1621
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:33,680
comes up to me and says should i start a

1622
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:33,679
business i'm going to say no

1623
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,798
and they'll be like oh you're supposed

1624
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,480
to motivate me if you need me to

1625
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:39,358
motivate you this is the wrong damn

1626
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:41,679
approach for you

1627
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,279
this is gonna be hard this is gonna be

1628
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,118
harder than you expect even with me

1629
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,559
telling you this

1630
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:50,960
and so it better damn well

1631
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,319
be worth it this better be your north

1632
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,358
[ __ ] star this

1633
00:54:52,318 --> 00:54:58,719
better live and be a way for you

1634
00:54:55,358 --> 00:55:01,759
to be able to articulate or realize

1635
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:04,318
those values that you want to live

1636
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:06,799
this isn't something to make money this

1637
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:09,119
is a way for you to live the life

1638
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:11,358
and be able to share the values that you

1639
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:13,119
have with the world

1640
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:16,798
and that's what it is and if you don't

1641
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:20,240
have that which is going to give you joy

1642
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:22,159
then we can walk away yeah

1643
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:23,439
this is not some way to make some money

1644
00:55:22,159 --> 00:55:25,199
and be known

1645
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:26,798
i mean this this includes both like

1646
00:55:25,199 --> 00:55:29,679
simple day-to-day joy

1647
00:55:26,798 --> 00:55:30,239
and also deep meaning exactly the whole

1648
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:32,639
thing

1649
00:55:30,239 --> 00:55:34,078
and that allows you to overcome all the

1650
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:35,920
all the pain along the way

1651
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:39,839
but i gotta say i mean it's a difficult

1652
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:41,760
thing because you run a business

1653
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,358
i'm this podcast and a lot of things i

1654
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:46,839
do research-wise

1655
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:48,159
is full of joy but it's simple running a

1656
00:55:46,838 --> 00:55:52,000
business

1657
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:54,399
is hard so

1658
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,519
it's something that i'm very hesitant

1659
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,760
about

1660
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,559
in that so to almost push back a little

1661
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:02,640
bit

1662
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:05,200
i think if i do get the guts

1663
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:05,759
to start the business it will not be

1664
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:08,078
because

1665
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:11,200
i'm not choosing a more joyful life

1666
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:12,960
because i'm already truly happy

1667
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,318
the reason i'll choose is because i just

1668
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,519
can't help it

1669
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:19,679
there's this i've always had this dream

1670
00:56:17,519 --> 00:56:22,000
and i know it's gonna lead to suffering

1671
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:24,318
and i know it's gonna

1672
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:26,639
be a life that has less happiness in it

1673
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:29,199
as sad as this to say

1674
00:56:26,639 --> 00:56:31,279
but it won't be it won't be less

1675
00:56:29,199 --> 00:56:33,039
happiness

1676
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,640
because we talk about this cup and where

1677
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:36,239
you choose to pour it

1678
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:37,920
and what you choose to do with it and

1679
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:39,519
when you look back on things

1680
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:42,159
the things that are going to give you

1681
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:43,599
the most joy the most proud the things

1682
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:44,000
that are going to stand out in your life

1683
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:46,960
that you

1684
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,838
really remember are going to be those

1685
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,559
days

1686
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:51,679
and your those years you struggle you're

1687
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:55,280
going to look back on

1688
00:56:51,679 --> 00:56:57,838
10 years later and go [ __ ]

1689
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,880
those were the glory days those were the

1690
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:00,960
glory days

1691
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,559
yeah and it won't feel like it at the

1692
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,599
time yeah

1693
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:07,040
so that's what life's made of and so

1694
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:09,119
this is your this is your opportunity

1695
00:57:07,039 --> 00:57:10,239
you feel that so right now you got this

1696
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,160
when you think about it

1697
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:13,279
you got this little thing twisting up in

1698
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:16,318
your gut right it's like

1699
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,880
it's a mixture of anxiety and fear as

1700
00:57:16,318 --> 00:57:19,838
well as

1701
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:22,000
excitement and that is that's your

1702
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:23,440
signal that this is your opportunity for

1703
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,920
that personal growth to challenge

1704
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,159
yourself

1705
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,838
this is your going for a run or working

1706
00:57:26,159 --> 00:57:30,558
out in the heat it's

1707
00:57:27,838 --> 00:57:31,759
it's those things it is your opportunity

1708
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,160
to go

1709
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:35,440
that maybe it even fails maybe it even

1710
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,399
fails

1711
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,400
but by turning into that you're gonna

1712
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,400
learn so much and it's going to make you

1713
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,240
so much better and it's the path that

1714
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:47,440
you should take when you have

1715
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:48,318
this stuff rolling around in there and i

1716
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,639
don't

1717
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:51,599
it could just be a hard conversation

1718
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:54,879
with your partner

1719
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:58,559
or your boss it could be taking on

1720
00:57:54,880 --> 00:58:00,400
a project that you know you know that

1721
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,599
your boss is thrown out to the team and

1722
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,960
you're like i'm gonna hide in the back i

1723
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,760
don't want that one

1724
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:08,400
and i was like maybe maybe you do maybe

1725
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:09,839
it's going back to school yeah maybe

1726
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,440
it's making that career move that you

1727
00:58:09,838 --> 00:58:17,199
always wanted but you're just

1728
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:20,240
you're just afraid of all these things

1729
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,279
are your opportunity for you to turn

1730
00:58:20,239 --> 00:58:24,078
into that

1731
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:25,519
it is your workout it is your practice

1732
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:27,519
because if you don't

1733
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:29,119
you'll get soft and who knows what's

1734
00:58:27,519 --> 00:58:29,920
coming and you're not going to be ready

1735
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:31,519
for it

1736
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:34,318
and it's going to run right over the top

1737
00:58:31,519 --> 00:58:37,119
of you because you're going to be

1738
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:38,960
weak you're going to be soft there's

1739
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:39,440
some aspect in which choosing that hard

1740
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,720
path

1741
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:44,318
is actually the the way to arrive at the

1742
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:47,759
richest kind of happiness

1743
00:58:44,318 --> 00:58:49,440
like the the greatest fulfillment

1744
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,799
that's the funny thing about just the

1745
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,559
human just make sure you're filling the

1746
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,880
cup as you're going through it

1747
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:55,920
all out so yeah that's the part to

1748
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,358
figure out right sure

1749
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:01,200
well life is short anyway um

1750
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:02,798
eventually eventually the cup will be

1751
00:59:01,199 --> 00:59:05,118
empty

1752
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:06,639
uh this will maybe time the refilling of

1753
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,240
the cup correctly

1754
00:59:06,639 --> 00:59:11,759
so you maximize the little time you got

1755
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,159
let me talk to you about strength a

1756
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,839
little bit first

1757
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:17,440
high level what are the differences in

1758
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:19,599
the different disciplines of strength so

1759
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,519
powerlifting we talked about

1760
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,318
maybe just to clarify for people power

1761
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:28,239
lifting olympic lifting

1762
00:59:24,318 --> 00:59:29,599
just regular gym fitness bodybuilding

1763
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:31,598
doing curls in front of the mirror for

1764
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,519
hours like i do what's what's the

1765
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:34,880
difference between all these oh and also

1766
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:36,159
strong man

1767
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:39,599
every one of those as far as the

1768
00:59:36,159 --> 00:59:42,480
athletic uh disciplines

1769
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,760
are different qualities so we want to

1770
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,559
think about things as

1771
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,119
terms of quality so there's strength

1772
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,880
there's

1773
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:54,079
power there's endurance there's

1774
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,280
the ability to um be coordinated and

1775
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,880
athletic there's

1776
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:58,559
all these things and they're different

1777
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:01,039
they're different qualities so

1778
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:02,880
your training as it relates to that is

1779
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:06,079
how you cycle in the development

1780
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,798
of those qualities what we want to think

1781
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,000
about is

1782
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,559
there's a lot of different frames of

1783
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,719
thought some very uh

1784
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:13,519
classical maybe not classical russian

1785
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,959
approach because there's a lot of

1786
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:17,280
different approach from the eastern

1787
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,639
bloc but one of the ones is developing

1788
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,599
all the qualities at once you know

1789
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:22,159
focusing on

1790
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:23,680
building those more of a periodization

1791
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:27,118
effect would be

1792
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:30,078
focusing on one quality at a time

1793
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,880
or one quality wall maintaining other

1794
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,240
qualities

1795
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,000
and then shifting that around so it's

1796
01:00:32,239 --> 01:00:35,279
just going to be a little different

1797
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,960
based on

1798
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,480
what the output is and what the desired

1799
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,079
so like

1800
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:41,679
powerlifting is actually power is the

1801
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,318
wrong word there's actually no power in

1802
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:46,000
it it's

1803
01:00:42,318 --> 01:00:48,239
just brute it's it's strength um

1804
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,920
application of force uh so olympic

1805
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:52,798
lifting would actually be a better

1806
01:00:49,920 --> 01:00:56,079
for powerlifting because that is more

1807
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:58,719
explosive uh development there's

1808
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,960
strongman is again now we're getting a

1809
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:02,639
little bit more athletic it's equipment

1810
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:04,960
based on the implements and stuff that

1811
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:07,519
are used how fast you can move your feet

1812
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:08,480
and run mixed with more endurance but

1813
01:01:07,519 --> 01:01:10,318
still very

1814
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,599
strength focused and there's some things

1815
01:01:10,318 --> 01:01:13,119
with strong man that is straight like

1816
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:16,318
each one of these is very

1817
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,720
also focused on different

1818
01:01:16,318 --> 01:01:20,480
genetic dispositions so actually if you

1819
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,439
look at the history of sports you'll

1820
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,760
find that they're

1821
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,200
a lot of times based on different

1822
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,720
populations that sounds like it's very

1823
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:29,598
on pc but like

1824
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:31,358
highland games they've got deep deeper

1825
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:32,880
hip sockets that are shallow so you're

1826
01:01:31,358 --> 01:01:34,078
going to see a lot of short hip hinge

1827
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:36,400
movements like the

1828
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:37,519
the caber toss and things like that muay

1829
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,119
thai wrestling

1830
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:41,519
they've got a completely different hip

1831
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:43,039
joint and so strongman itself is

1832
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:44,719
going to be for very large framed

1833
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,358
individuals if you're not well over six

1834
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:46,879
foot

1835
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:48,798
and a large person you're probably not

1836
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:50,480
going to perform well very few people

1837
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:52,239
sub six foot have ever done well at

1838
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:55,920
strongman just because it's it's

1839
01:01:52,239 --> 01:01:59,038
leverage based right um olympic lifting

1840
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:02,480
we see consistently in in europe

1841
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:06,400
uh the the history tells us a high

1842
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:08,159
level of hip uh and back issues

1843
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:09,920
because of the depth that that hip

1844
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,519
socket has to go in to be able to

1845
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:13,280
complete that lift

1846
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:15,119
and so you're going to see issues with

1847
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:16,480
populations that don't have the ability

1848
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:18,240
to do that so

1849
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,519
so we've talked a little bit about

1850
01:02:18,239 --> 01:02:22,399
training as well as

1851
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:23,920
disposition yeah so and also crossfit

1852
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,960
instance of that that's more like strong

1853
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:27,680
man but for

1854
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:29,039
a wider variety of bodies i suppose yep

1855
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:30,558
and definitely more metabolic

1856
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:34,559
conditioning focus than the

1857
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:36,160
than the strength aspect of it um and

1858
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,079
and conditioning is an interesting thing

1859
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:40,399
too so that quality

1860
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,119
in my opinion can be developed a lot

1861
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:44,160
faster

1862
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:46,880
but kind of peaks much faster as well so

1863
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:48,078
you where strength we can continue to

1864
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:51,119
add and add an add over

1865
01:02:48,079 --> 01:02:52,880
time so it's

1866
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:54,318
for me like for conditioning with any

1867
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:55,358
strength athlete i don't like to spend

1868
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,400
as much time

1869
01:02:55,358 --> 01:03:00,400
on that so i'll cycle the conditioning

1870
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,480
work for our strength athletes

1871
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,838
and then taper that off leading into

1872
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,358
meat so the more

1873
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:07,199
metabolic work that means the more

1874
01:03:05,358 --> 01:03:08,318
capacity in strength training that you

1875
01:03:07,199 --> 01:03:12,078
can accomplish

1876
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:14,318
which is the goal and recover from

1877
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:16,240
but then as we lead to a competition we

1878
01:03:14,318 --> 01:03:17,679
want to spend more time on recovering

1879
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:19,439
from that so we have to pull things out

1880
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:22,078
so we'd pull out less so like

1881
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:24,240
a typical approach would be like taking

1882
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,798
a six-week cycle for conditioning

1883
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:28,558
and ramping ramping up over three weeks

1884
01:03:26,798 --> 01:03:29,440
periods time then dropping back down

1885
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,519
again

1886
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:33,440
and ramping up and being slightly offset

1887
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:34,159
by like a week or two from your strength

1888
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,679
peaks

1889
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:37,440
so that you've actually tapered the week

1890
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:38,159
prior in your conditioning work to your

1891
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:39,838
strength work

1892
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:41,279
right and but that way we're not hitting

1893
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:42,239
conditioning hard all the time which is

1894
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:44,559
a common

1895
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:45,838
common uh misstep that people make is

1896
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,319
going well i need conditioning

1897
01:03:45,838 --> 01:03:49,279
so they just hammer that at a base level

1898
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:52,798
over the top

1899
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:55,440
instead of cycling that if we talk about

1900
01:03:52,798 --> 01:03:58,960
power lifting

1901
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,280
in terms of regimen

1902
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,079
in terms of exercise yeah in terms of

1903
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,640
the process

1904
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,000
the wood consistent with what is there

1905
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,000
something to be said about

1906
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,239
general qualities of the consistency of

1907
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:13,679
the regimen required to get strong

1908
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:17,838
yes so let's talk about some training

1909
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:19,598
principles as a whole and this will

1910
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,199
i think this will break the down what

1911
01:04:19,599 --> 01:04:23,440
you're what you're one

1912
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:24,960
the more work that we can fit into a

1913
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,760
given time

1914
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:29,679
the more progress we're going to make

1915
01:04:27,760 --> 01:04:31,359
but that doesn't mean doing the max

1916
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:34,399
amount of work

1917
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:37,358
possible at any given time

1918
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,880
so we know that we're always to to

1919
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:39,519
accomplish more we're always going to

1920
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,798
have more

1921
01:04:39,519 --> 01:04:41,920
and there's a certain ceiling that

1922
01:04:40,798 --> 01:04:43,599
you're going to hit that you're not

1923
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,280
going to be able to add more so

1924
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:46,960
you want to start and get the most

1925
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,440
amount of results that you can with the

1926
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,240
least

1927
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:51,200
amount of work because you're going to

1928
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:54,479
have to do it

1929
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:57,838
again like this stair step over and over

1930
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:59,599
year decades so on so when people is a

1931
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:02,000
big miss people got they look at

1932
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:03,039
uh a chico program from russia or so on

1933
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,599
and they go

1934
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:07,039
i'm gonna follow this and it's like that

1935
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,519
was specifically written for somebody

1936
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:11,280
with 20 years of experience

1937
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,719
that's already built the capacities to

1938
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:14,079
be at that level so it's all about

1939
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:15,519
building that work capacity

1940
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:17,440
so how much work can you give in a given

1941
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,318
time so now we want to look at some

1942
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:20,960
research

1943
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:22,639
as it relates to injuries because

1944
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,679
injuries are going to be a big driver

1945
01:05:22,639 --> 01:05:26,798
over time

1946
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:30,558
of what holds you back so when we talk

1947
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:31,280
consistency training hard for three

1948
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:33,760
years

1949
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,119
five years it's gonna be really good but

1950
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:37,039
what we find is a lot of people train

1951
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:38,960
really hard for nine months

1952
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:40,960
have to slow back for a month get back

1953
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,079
into it and miss another week because

1954
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:44,240
and so on they're always like this

1955
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:47,519
little nagging that little nagging

1956
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,959
and so it's pretty clear in the research

1957
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:51,119
we wanna we're looking at when we're

1958
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:54,400
stair stepping this stuff we're looking

1959
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:57,440
at acute and chronic loading so

1960
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:59,039
some fancy words for average and like

1961
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,760
what's happening right now

1962
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:03,440
so this given week would be our acute

1963
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:05,039
chronic would be what is our average

1964
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,920
loading let's say over the last six

1965
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,280
months

1966
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,880
okay so the more that we can move the

1967
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,680
chronic loading up the more work we're

1968
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,599
getting done on

1969
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:15,519
as a whole over time we're going to get

1970
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:16,960
stronger the way that we build the

1971
01:06:15,519 --> 01:06:20,639
capacity to do that

1972
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:24,159
is having spikes in acute loading okay

1973
01:06:20,639 --> 01:06:27,440
now as we do this the

1974
01:06:24,159 --> 01:06:28,399
the acute loading if it spikes more than

1975
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:31,838
10

1976
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:32,318
maybe 15 percent from what the chronic

1977
01:06:31,838 --> 01:06:35,920
loading

1978
01:06:32,318 --> 01:06:39,199
has been that accounts for

1979
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:41,280
eighty percent of injuries out there

1980
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:44,000
so it's not actually the movement

1981
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:46,240
quality or this misstep or the other

1982
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:47,920
it usually happens about four five six

1983
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:49,199
weeks later it's like oh this nagging

1984
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,760
and then it gets worse and then now you

1985
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:51,199
gotta

1986
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:53,200
you gotta do some rehab your training

1987
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:54,480
sessions aren't as good and so on

1988
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:56,719
so now we're starting to look at this

1989
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,400
okay it's like i wanna do the

1990
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,719
i wanna do the least amount of work

1991
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:03,280
where i can still progress

1992
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:05,439
i want to be able to have spikes in my

1993
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:09,039
weekly demand

1994
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,880
that don't go above 10 to 15 percent of

1995
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,720
what i've been averaging for the last

1996
01:07:10,880 --> 01:07:14,160
month but every time i do a spike my

1997
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:17,439
average goes up right

1998
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:19,199
boom boom boom and then that becomes

1999
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:21,679
very particular also when you take

2000
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,318
when you do take plantain time off so a

2001
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:24,719
lot of people

2002
01:07:22,318 --> 01:07:26,079
uh training session maybe they're doing

2003
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:29,118
a five-week block with a

2004
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,599
a deload week or you go on vacation for

2005
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,599
a week

2006
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,200
or any of those things that were a

2007
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,240
downward what does that do to your

2008
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:35,759
average in chronic loading

2009
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:37,598
it brings it down and then what does the

2010
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,760
person want to do when they come back

2011
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,640
make up for it now they have a huge

2012
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,799
spike above

2013
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:44,639
five weeks later we're dealing with ah

2014
01:07:42,798 --> 01:07:46,000
this elbow this wrist whatever's kind of

2015
01:07:44,639 --> 01:07:48,480
bothering me and now you're not

2016
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:50,559
performing as much so these are some

2017
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:53,440
really fundamental pieces of

2018
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:54,880
of of training and then now we can start

2019
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:56,559
overlaying the qualities that we're

2020
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,318
trying to develop that we were talked

2021
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:00,960
about earlier so now it's

2022
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:02,159
let's talk about my deadlift my thousand

2023
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,838
pound deadlift we'll talk about the

2024
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:07,038
training cycles for both the thousand

2025
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:09,599
uh deadlift and squat so backing up

2026
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:11,119
a year out from the deadlift knowing i

2027
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:14,160
was training at the time

2028
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:14,798
heavy deadlifts once a week and usually

2029
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:16,158
it was

2030
01:08:14,798 --> 01:08:17,759
two of those sessions a month were

2031
01:08:16,158 --> 01:08:18,158
really heavy and the others weren't it's

2032
01:08:17,759 --> 01:08:20,158
like

2033
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:23,119
okay how can we get this up to where i'm

2034
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:25,838
deadlifting twice a week

2035
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:27,198
because that's where i want to be uh to

2036
01:08:25,838 --> 01:08:28,479
be able to accomplish this i need to be

2037
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:30,158
loading about

2038
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,519
that much with frequency with a certain

2039
01:08:30,158 --> 01:08:31,838
volume to be able to accomplish this

2040
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:32,719
goal

2041
01:08:31,838 --> 01:08:34,318
we're not going to go through all the

2042
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:35,439
math and stuff like that and how that's

2043
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:38,080
arrived but there is

2044
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:38,719
there is math behind this and so instead

2045
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:40,399
of just

2046
01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:41,838
like oh let's start dead lifting twice a

2047
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:44,798
week no

2048
01:08:41,838 --> 01:08:46,158
so we start and we take the one session

2049
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:48,798
that we've got

2050
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:50,238
and we split it part of it take part of

2051
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:51,759
it away and put it in the second half of

2052
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:53,119
the week so the total volume is still

2053
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:56,880
the same

2054
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:58,000
and then we start adding some volume but

2055
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,880
i'm doing it at a

2056
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:02,158
off of block so that the actual load is

2057
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:03,440
the cumulative load is less because i

2058
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,759
have less range of motion

2059
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:07,119
okay and then we start building that

2060
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:08,158
closer to the ground closer to the

2061
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:09,759
ground and so on

2062
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,679
and now we start getting to where i'm

2063
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,640
almost doing two sessions full sessions

2064
01:09:11,679 --> 01:09:15,600
a week

2065
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,159
and then we start adding a little bit of

2066
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,079
load

2067
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:20,079
and so at my level this isn't talking

2068
01:09:18,079 --> 01:09:23,039
about adding another set

2069
01:09:20,079 --> 01:09:23,838
or another day a week we're talking like

2070
01:09:23,039 --> 01:09:27,838
in my squat

2071
01:09:23,838 --> 01:09:31,039
it might be one rep instead of doing

2072
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:31,759
three sets of three at one week i do two

2073
01:09:31,039 --> 01:09:34,000
doubles

2074
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:35,198
or two triples then two doubles to give

2075
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:38,319
me one

2076
01:09:35,198 --> 01:09:39,678
more rep that's it and so we're doing

2077
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:41,359
that from one week

2078
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:42,719
to the next and that's a cycle training

2079
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:43,279
cycle it might be five six weeks and

2080
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:45,359
then so on

2081
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,400
the next one and slowly bringing that

2082
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,000
average load

2083
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:50,879
up so the last phases of the squat for

2084
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,560
example

2085
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,079
we took the average loading every week

2086
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,080
so my of my heavy sets

2087
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:58,800
so once we developed all this stuff over

2088
01:09:56,079 --> 01:10:02,800
the last year to get to this point

2089
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:04,239
now it is taking and going okay my

2090
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:07,760
average load this week

2091
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:08,639
is eight reps at 955 pounds and then the

2092
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,400
next week

2093
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:13,840
let's get it to nine nine fifty seven

2094
01:10:12,399 --> 01:10:15,599
nine sixty three and this was pretty

2095
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:17,039
aggressive working up to where my

2096
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:20,000
average loading the final

2097
01:10:17,039 --> 01:10:21,920
that fit the final was 985 pounds

2098
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,960
average load for eight to nine reps

2099
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,560
and that's what i said this is the

2100
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,920
intense part that was why it was the day

2101
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:29,920
of was much easier

2102
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:32,079
that week over week is pretty brutal

2103
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,520
may not sound oh you're just squatting

2104
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:34,079
and now let's back up let's look at the

2105
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,360
quality

2106
01:10:34,079 --> 01:10:38,399
development so a year out from the squat

2107
01:10:37,359 --> 01:10:40,639
obviously i've been working on

2108
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:43,119
developing axial load capacity my

2109
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,119
capacity to withstand load from top to

2110
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:46,479
bottom so i like thinking about things

2111
01:10:45,119 --> 01:10:48,960
in movement vectors

2112
01:10:46,479 --> 01:10:50,799
so this vector is an axial loaded vector

2113
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:54,000
is the hardest to recover from

2114
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:56,480
uh so what's actual so like is deadlift

2115
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,920
are they both they're both yep so a

2116
01:10:56,479 --> 01:11:00,158
horizontal

2117
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,960
a front to back would be like a row or a

2118
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:03,839
press

2119
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:05,279
why is the axial uh hard to recover from

2120
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:06,880
because this entire body the entire

2121
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:10,238
entire body just anything that is

2122
01:11:06,880 --> 01:11:10,880
that that uh taxes the the the spinal

2123
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:13,919
mechanics

2124
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:17,119
i i don't i could tell you my beliefs

2125
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:18,560
it's studied it is okay um

2126
01:11:17,119 --> 01:11:20,719
we can just keep the discussion on that

2127
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,120
but short like that so

2128
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:24,800
um so we start looking at those

2129
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:26,238
different vectors that we're training in

2130
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:27,679
so this is why

2131
01:11:26,238 --> 01:11:29,359
this is important to understand so i'm

2132
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:32,158
not just getting into nuance here

2133
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:34,559
so hey squatting is going to make me

2134
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:37,279
make me jump further because it's legs

2135
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:37,840
well squatting is an axial load vector

2136
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:40,960
and

2137
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,400
jumping is a vector this way so actually

2138
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,719
hip thrust

2139
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:45,839
would help with urine your and this is

2140
01:11:44,719 --> 01:11:48,239
proven in science

2141
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:49,920
with your forward jumping ability uh

2142
01:11:48,238 --> 01:11:51,198
they're both working similar muscles the

2143
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:53,039
glute extension

2144
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:54,559
but they're working it in those

2145
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:56,319
different platforms so it's really

2146
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,840
important to understand because

2147
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:59,359
people don't understand i'm building my

2148
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:02,079
work capacity by doing

2149
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:04,238
sled pushes you're not developing your

2150
01:12:02,079 --> 01:12:07,519
work capacity for squatting

2151
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:10,559
most movements even ones as

2152
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,000
holistic as a as a squat require

2153
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:13,760
specialization

2154
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,600
yeah you can't get strong at the squat

2155
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,400
by doing you're going to have some

2156
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:19,679
carryover

2157
01:12:16,399 --> 01:12:21,039
right obviously but because taking an

2158
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,960
untrained person that hasn't done it

2159
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:24,960
it's not still not going to do as good

2160
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:26,239
as somebody that's done non-specific

2161
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:28,399
work but done work

2162
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:29,359
so but yes for the most part to get

2163
01:12:28,399 --> 01:12:32,158
truly strong

2164
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:32,799
you need to specialize so but not all

2165
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:35,279
the time

2166
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,199
so now we talk about quality so and if

2167
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:39,519
we specialize in the same thing too long

2168
01:12:37,198 --> 01:12:40,879
we stagnate because the body adapts to a

2169
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,760
certain point and just can't make

2170
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:43,840
progress

2171
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:45,840
so we wanted to save the actual

2172
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,719
squatting in the pattern with the bar

2173
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:50,800
that i was doing

2174
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:53,679
for the very end so starting a year out

2175
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:54,400
i started doing work front squatting

2176
01:12:53,679 --> 01:12:56,158
like a squat

2177
01:12:54,399 --> 01:12:58,079
axial loaded pattern and worked on

2178
01:12:56,158 --> 01:13:01,839
maximizing that up

2179
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:03,760
then i started shifting to doing

2180
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,960
transformer bar squat it's this bar i

2181
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:06,719
developed that actually changed and

2182
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:08,560
manipulates spinal mechanics so i

2183
01:13:06,719 --> 01:13:09,520
started loading in these more forward

2184
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,360
positions

2185
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,360
and being able again so now i'm getting

2186
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:14,319
closer than a front squat but not quite

2187
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:16,559
squatting and then

2188
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:18,399
i would start adjusting that bar every

2189
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:20,560
training cycle to closer to a squat

2190
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:21,679
toaster to a squat till it finally was

2191
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,560
right so what's the difference between a

2192
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:25,600
front squat

2193
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:27,120
and a regular like a back squat like in

2194
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,679
terms of the

2195
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:30,880
the stress on the body the mechanics was

2196
01:13:29,679 --> 01:13:31,600
there something interesting to be said

2197
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,039
about

2198
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:35,039
like how fundamentally different are

2199
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,800
they so what's interesting

2200
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:38,479
people think about the weight in

2201
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,159
imposition to them like oh the bar's in

2202
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:43,279
front of me the bar's behind me

2203
01:13:40,158 --> 01:13:46,000
which is not the case the bar

2204
01:13:43,279 --> 01:13:48,158
is above your midfoot the load is above

2205
01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:50,560
your midfoot

2206
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:52,158
so we're actually manipulating the spine

2207
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,239
behind the bar

2208
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:55,679
so we're causing spinal uprighting

2209
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:56,238
behind the bar getting in a more erect

2210
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,920
position

2211
01:13:56,238 --> 01:13:59,519
which is going to change the

2212
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:01,359
relationship of the hip angle

2213
01:13:59,520 --> 01:14:03,199
it's going to change our ability to

2214
01:14:01,359 --> 01:14:03,679
maintain the spine it's going to change

2215
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:06,559
the

2216
01:14:03,679 --> 01:14:07,760
uh how much the the core comes in how

2217
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,440
hard it is to

2218
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:11,199
maintain that sternum to diaphragm

2219
01:14:09,439 --> 01:14:13,119
relationship that we talked about

2220
01:14:11,198 --> 01:14:14,879
all this stuff starts changing so the

2221
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:16,800
bar stays in the same place the bar's

2222
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,640
still behind you but the load

2223
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:21,440
moves around so but we're actually

2224
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:23,760
manipulating the spine around the load

2225
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:24,559
yeah it's incredible we can tailor it to

2226
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,840
an athlete

2227
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,600
which is great when you've got a seven

2228
01:14:25,840 --> 01:14:28,560
foot plus tall baseball player or

2229
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,000
basketball player

2230
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,520
that's why we work with all these teams

2231
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:32,960
anyway so it's like you're taking

2232
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:33,360
something and getting closer and closer

2233
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:34,719
to it

2234
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:37,119
at the same time we're looking at the

2235
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:38,800
quality so like i needed to be able to

2236
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:39,840
really hold this torso position with the

2237
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,440
weight moving up here

2238
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,360
now unlike the deadlift the ability to

2239
01:14:41,439 --> 01:14:45,678
manage this tl position

2240
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:47,198
becomes much more challenging so that

2241
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,239
was also why i was choosing the

2242
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:50,000
transformer bar

2243
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:51,678
because it actually challenges that more

2244
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,520
in those big forward positions

2245
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,719
i was also working on my back strength

2246
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:56,719
tremendously

2247
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:58,079
to be able to hold a maintained position

2248
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,960
so there was a lot of like

2249
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:02,880
i chose a bent over rows so bent over

2250
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:03,439
row is a mixed vector so it's a forward

2251
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,960
to back

2252
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:07,359
so it wouldn't have as much carrier but

2253
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:09,359
it's also um

2254
01:15:07,359 --> 01:15:10,479
got some axial loading components in it

2255
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:12,880
as well

2256
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:14,238
so we're working on that and then as it

2257
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:15,520
as we get closer and closer to

2258
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:16,718
competition i'm developing those

2259
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:19,120
strengths but now i need to start

2260
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:21,520
tapering those out so all of my recovery

2261
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:24,640
needs can now go into the more specific

2262
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,960
that i'm actually ramping the load up so

2263
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:28,880
as i'm ramping the load on the weight

2264
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:30,640
i'm able to ramp it a lot faster

2265
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:33,359
because i'm tapering out the other stuff

2266
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:37,119
so i can still keep my total load

2267
01:15:33,359 --> 01:15:38,559
high but now get it very very specific

2268
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:41,039
wow so everything i've done has always

2269
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:42,640
been kind of an annual training cycle

2270
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:44,238
and then again this was like a this was

2271
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,679
a five-year training cycle but we just

2272
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:48,238
kind of walked through the last year of

2273
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:51,520
each and you can see how these concepts

2274
01:15:48,238 --> 01:15:54,399
play out in reality so in the cycling

2275
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:56,480
so this is both for you but also for

2276
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:59,599
more recreational

2277
01:15:56,479 --> 01:16:01,359
strength athletes let's say

2278
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:03,199
there's variety injected into the system

2279
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:06,719
you need variety yeah

2280
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:08,319
yeah because you will basically stagnate

2281
01:16:06,719 --> 01:16:10,000
at some level right so you should

2282
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,000
should always be kind of shifting a

2283
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,600
little bit so um

2284
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:15,600
three to four month blocks in general

2285
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:18,800
for an average you know just a

2286
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:20,480
gen pop fitness is pretty good um

2287
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:22,239
where you're going to spend more time

2288
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:23,519
maybe in a higher rep range or lower rep

2289
01:16:22,238 --> 01:16:26,079
range a little bit more

2290
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,360
uh work on uh endurance capacity or

2291
01:16:26,079 --> 01:16:28,238
maybe some more time hey i'm playing

2292
01:16:27,359 --> 01:16:29,839
around with

2293
01:16:28,238 --> 01:16:31,198
boxing or jiu jitsu or something like

2294
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:32,560
that bring that a little bit more to the

2295
01:16:31,198 --> 01:16:34,639
front forefront for a while and bring

2296
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:36,640
the other out but like

2297
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,320
mixing mixing those variables up but

2298
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,840
trying to keep the total load the same

2299
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:41,840
and always kind of like

2300
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,880
no do we add a little more again it

2301
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,159
doesn't have to be major and it

2302
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,440
shouldn't be major you don't want these

2303
01:16:44,158 --> 01:16:48,799
big jumps you don't go

2304
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:50,719
oh my god let's move uh let's jump into

2305
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:52,719
squatting every day

2306
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:54,079
um you've got to build the capacity to

2307
01:16:52,719 --> 01:16:57,760
do that

2308
01:16:54,079 --> 01:17:00,319
it's simple what role would you say

2309
01:16:57,760 --> 01:17:01,520
strength has in sports that combine

2310
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:03,519
skill and strength

2311
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:06,480
so for me personally maybe i'll just ask

2312
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:10,159
it selfishly which is uh

2313
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:13,678
grappling wrestling mma yeah

2314
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:16,799
how about i start with baseball please

2315
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:17,279
uh no i wouldn't okay i know the sport

2316
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:19,360
okay

2317
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:20,399
like baseball and golf for the two of my

2318
01:17:19,359 --> 01:17:23,759
favorite sports

2319
01:17:20,399 --> 01:17:25,439
uh no i don't you don't have to be in

2320
01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:26,159
shape at all to excel at those sports

2321
01:17:25,439 --> 01:17:28,158
well

2322
01:17:26,158 --> 01:17:29,679
here's the thing there so you're gonna

2323
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:31,759
get this argument

2324
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,600
well i've got a perfect example because

2325
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:34,800
this is this is why i sell so many

2326
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,719
transformer bars into the

2327
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,920
the major league baseball so they get

2328
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,560
these people

2329
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,119
uh that come in these athletes that have

2330
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:43,520
been

2331
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:44,559
baseball their whole life it is part of

2332
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:46,480
the culture

2333
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,840
and so they're great athletes they've

2334
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:50,319
got all this skill

2335
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:53,039
the only thing they have to do is

2336
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,960
develop a little bit more resilience

2337
01:17:53,039 --> 01:17:56,399
so that they don't have the injury they

2338
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,800
can push their training a little bit

2339
01:17:56,399 --> 01:17:59,119
more

2340
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,159
that we can add a little bit more force

2341
01:17:59,119 --> 01:18:02,399
output and

2342
01:18:00,158 --> 01:18:03,759
be able to recover from it so the only

2343
01:18:02,399 --> 01:18:05,279
thing they've got to do

2344
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:06,800
is add some training but there's no

2345
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:08,319
training culture there so they don't

2346
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:10,159
have any experience which is why

2347
01:18:08,319 --> 01:18:11,279
they love the transformer bar because

2348
01:18:10,158 --> 01:18:12,479
they don't have to worry about teaching

2349
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:13,920
the technique we can actually set the

2350
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,479
bar on a setting that makes their squats

2351
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:16,000
perfect

2352
01:18:14,479 --> 01:18:17,519
by queuing all the stuff with actually

2353
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:19,359
not having to coach it because when

2354
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:21,120
you're coaching a room full of athletes

2355
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:22,399
it's really hard to teach the nuance of

2356
01:18:21,119 --> 01:18:24,479
all this and not sure

2357
01:18:22,399 --> 01:18:26,000
that all that but that's all that they

2358
01:18:24,479 --> 01:18:28,000
have to do with these players with

2359
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,760
a huge level of skill so once you reach

2360
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:33,119
a certain level of skill

2361
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:34,800
adding strength is the the only real

2362
01:18:33,119 --> 01:18:38,079
forward path

2363
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,039
so so that's the the basic simple answer

2364
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,800
to that

2365
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:42,319
um so one of the benefits there being

2366
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:45,760
like injury prevention actually

2367
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:47,679
injury resilience because especially uh

2368
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,600
fighting sports you're going to be

2369
01:18:47,679 --> 01:18:50,480
challenged and thrown and other things

2370
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:52,159
happen to you

2371
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:54,479
and the more resilient you can make your

2372
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:55,920
structures the better you're gonna be

2373
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:57,759
even a cyclist

2374
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:58,880
mountain biking why would they need it

2375
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,280
why would they need to do upper body

2376
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:02,239
training

2377
01:18:59,279 --> 01:19:02,639
take a crash your shoulder's gone you're

2378
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:04,479
done

2379
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:06,400
your career is over unless you've done a

2380
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:08,639
little training

2381
01:19:06,399 --> 01:19:10,960
right so so there's value in all this

2382
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,960
stuff but uh the resilience is like

2383
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:14,158
that's that's huge and then we can

2384
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:16,640
overlay strength

2385
01:19:14,158 --> 01:19:18,639
the people where we miss is this focus

2386
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:21,039
on strength when we haven't developed

2387
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,560
quality motor patterns first so this is

2388
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:24,399
a huge thing with uh

2389
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,800
children because people want to know

2390
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:28,399
what's the appropriate training age

2391
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:30,880
i'd had my daughter training before my

2392
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:32,559
son because she developed

2393
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:34,239
movement patterns at a better quality

2394
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:35,199
earlier there's no age because it's

2395
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:37,439
going to be very

2396
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:39,039
dependent on the individual there's no

2397
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,759
point in having adaptation if we don't

2398
01:19:39,039 --> 01:19:41,760
have the right

2399
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:43,360
thing to adapt to yet and that applies

2400
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,039
to general movement but also

2401
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,719
the sport you see you're saying the

2402
01:19:45,039 --> 01:19:49,198
skills should be developed first and the

2403
01:19:46,719 --> 01:19:52,239
strength applied on top of that yep

2404
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:55,599
maybe you can educate me but

2405
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:59,678
i actually quit lifting and powerlifting

2406
01:19:55,600 --> 01:20:02,880
for a long time after i started um

2407
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:05,199
judo jiu jitsu grappling all this sort

2408
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:07,920
of combat sports

2409
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:10,079
because i found that it was preventing

2410
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:14,399
me from

2411
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:18,000
relaxing my body enough to uh

2412
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:21,119
load in the skill so this isn't

2413
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:22,079
a problem with the uh training this is a

2414
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:25,119
problem with you

2415
01:20:22,079 --> 01:20:25,679
yeah so this is actually really really

2416
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:28,960
important

2417
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:33,039
the first product i ever released was

2418
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:35,600
a loadable mace a swinging mace

2419
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:37,600
and because every power lifter and body

2420
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,280
well not every but most

2421
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,120
serious power lifters and bodybuilders

2422
01:20:39,279 --> 01:20:44,238
like shoulders

2423
01:20:41,119 --> 01:20:45,760
mobility is pretty limited

2424
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:47,279
and most of them really really struggle

2425
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:49,119
with this

2426
01:20:47,279 --> 01:20:52,399
the problem is they've been taught to

2427
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:54,479
have tension all the time

2428
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:56,000
and that's not good so when we talk

2429
01:20:54,479 --> 01:20:57,279
about like the joint positions that we

2430
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:58,319
were talking about earlier and having

2431
01:20:57,279 --> 01:21:01,039
those and the muscles in the right

2432
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:06,719
length and tension relationship

2433
01:21:01,039 --> 01:21:09,119
athleticism is the speed to relaxation

2434
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:10,800
because the counter is speed to to speed

2435
01:21:09,119 --> 01:21:13,679
to contraction

2436
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:14,400
float like a butterfly sting like a bee

2437
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:16,639
right

2438
01:21:14,399 --> 01:21:17,599
and so what a mace can do is use that

2439
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:19,279
because this is a

2440
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:20,800
ties back into a developmental

2441
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:22,800
kinesiology because

2442
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:24,719
a lot of like reset patterns are getting

2443
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,840
back into these basic movements but it's

2444
01:21:24,719 --> 01:21:28,000
as much about relaxation as it is

2445
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:30,960
contraction

2446
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,319
okay so a mace we have this weight on a

2447
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:34,158
big long lever

2448
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:36,238
so i if i grab a kettlebell and be like

2449
01:21:34,158 --> 01:21:38,399
let's say movement is a kettlebell halo

2450
01:21:36,238 --> 01:21:39,839
it is the same movement but here in the

2451
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:43,039
halo i'm on

2452
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,920
the whole time with the mace at the

2453
01:21:43,039 --> 01:21:46,319
proper length

2454
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:47,440
with the right distribution you cannot

2455
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:49,679
do the movement

2456
01:21:47,439 --> 01:21:51,359
you could not move force your way

2457
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:52,399
through it the only way that you can

2458
01:21:51,359 --> 01:21:55,599
accomplish that

2459
01:21:52,399 --> 01:21:57,599
is by relaxing and then

2460
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:59,360
now we now we can contract all the

2461
01:21:57,600 --> 01:22:02,000
muscles related around

2462
01:21:59,359 --> 01:22:02,559
that shoulder girdle all at once we're

2463
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:06,000
working

2464
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:08,080
on off on off on off with moving

2465
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:09,679
and contracting and now so what happens

2466
01:22:08,079 --> 01:22:11,600
a lot of times as we

2467
01:22:09,679 --> 01:22:13,600
you know this stiffness and tightness

2468
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:14,480
happens if we're in poor positions we

2469
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:17,600
start using

2470
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:19,198
stabilizer muscles to do the movement

2471
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:20,960
and then that's where this stiffness

2472
01:22:19,198 --> 01:22:23,039
come from so it means that

2473
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:24,719
in some of whatever training that you're

2474
01:22:23,039 --> 01:22:28,238
doing there's a deficit

2475
01:22:24,719 --> 01:22:29,359
in the movement quality okay or

2476
01:22:28,238 --> 01:22:30,799
there's a deficit in the training

2477
01:22:29,359 --> 01:22:31,439
program and you're not recovering from

2478
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,880
and 80

2479
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:34,879
of the time that's the right answer

2480
01:22:32,880 --> 01:22:36,880
right but yeah that's where the

2481
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:38,239
where the gap is and learning how to

2482
01:22:36,880 --> 01:22:40,719
relax

2483
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:41,359
and the way a lot of the exercises are

2484
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:42,719
taught

2485
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:44,639
and have been taught for a long time

2486
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,520
which is why there's a big gap and this

2487
01:22:44,639 --> 01:22:47,359
is why

2488
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,199
both clinical rehab and all these other

2489
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:50,559
components are mixed in my philosophy

2490
01:22:49,198 --> 01:22:51,519
and what i'm trying to do with kabuki

2491
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:53,760
strength

2492
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:55,760
because i'm looking at holistic movement

2493
01:22:53,760 --> 01:22:57,440
i'm not looking at powerlifting

2494
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:00,400
bass movements are what i want to load

2495
01:22:57,439 --> 01:23:03,519
and be able to assess on

2496
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:05,599
but this affects all sports

2497
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:07,120
all activities and strength doesn't have

2498
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,039
to be that

2499
01:23:07,119 --> 01:23:10,559
i mean i i'm i'm freaking a thousand

2500
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:12,319
pound squatter and dead lifter

2501
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:14,239
if you watch any of my videos where i do

2502
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:15,920
like complete quad fallbacks

2503
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:18,238
i don't stretch at all i can usually get

2504
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:21,119
close to a full split like if i want to

2505
01:23:18,238 --> 01:23:21,599
um what no i did not see those videos

2506
01:23:21,119 --> 01:23:25,039
okay

2507
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,239
that's uh it's hard to believe wow okay

2508
01:23:25,039 --> 01:23:28,319
well actually i do i just did one

2509
01:23:26,238 --> 01:23:29,678
recently a quad fallback with my with my

2510
01:23:28,319 --> 01:23:31,439
mace loaded way out to the end

2511
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,520
tortioning on both ends of the other and

2512
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,479
like i do a lot of i do a lot of weird

2513
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:37,600
stuff

2514
01:23:34,479 --> 01:23:40,479
um that's awesome okay squatting doesn't

2515
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,960
make your hips tight squatting like [ __ ]

2516
01:23:40,479 --> 01:23:44,479
makes

2517
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:46,480
your hips tight and so

2518
01:23:44,479 --> 01:23:48,158
but there is no perfect world we're

2519
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:50,238
always our training program isn't quite

2520
01:23:48,158 --> 01:23:51,679
perfect our movement isn't necessarily

2521
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:52,638
perfect like so you're going to have the

2522
01:23:51,679 --> 01:23:55,600
needs for this stuff

2523
01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:57,359
but if you're always have to do some

2524
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,840
soft tissue work to loosen up the same

2525
01:23:57,359 --> 01:23:59,439
one

2526
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,880
for that exercise to be able to get a

2527
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:02,559
joint in position

2528
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,840
there is a problem and i'm not saying

2529
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:04,960
don't do it do it because i don't want

2530
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:06,480
you to have a joint

2531
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:09,359
like if i can't get my shoulders in a

2532
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:10,799
position i can't do overhead presses

2533
01:24:09,359 --> 01:24:11,839
because i'm going to compromise my spine

2534
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:13,039
position then i'm going to end up with

2535
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,480
some other problems right

2536
01:24:13,039 --> 01:24:16,238
so go ahead and clean that up so you can

2537
01:24:14,479 --> 01:24:20,238
get in position

2538
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:22,238
but go figure out why it is and fix it

2539
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:23,198
and then maybe next you know three four

2540
01:24:22,238 --> 01:24:25,279
months from now they're gonna get a

2541
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:27,439
little something else going on

2542
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:29,039
fix it but understand the deeper root

2543
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:32,158
reason of why

2544
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:34,238
so i'm i believe i am the only company

2545
01:24:32,158 --> 01:24:36,079
manufacturing and selling you know

2546
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:36,399
fascial soft tissue tools and i'll tell

2547
01:24:36,079 --> 01:24:39,679
you

2548
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:41,279
i don't want you to use them

2549
01:24:39,679 --> 01:24:43,600
because it's not helping you get to the

2550
01:24:41,279 --> 01:24:44,479
why why it was caused in the first place

2551
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:46,800
yeah

2552
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:48,559
the goal the goal the perfect state is

2553
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:50,000
not having to use them

2554
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:51,600
reality is you're going to have to use

2555
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,960
them from time to time because the

2556
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:56,320
world's not perfect

2557
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:59,198
yeah so your discovery is 100 on point

2558
01:24:56,319 --> 01:24:59,840
well there's another side to combat

2559
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:02,479
sports

2560
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:04,480
when you're beginning a particular

2561
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:07,519
combat sport

2562
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:09,919
strength can be a negative because

2563
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,600
human psychology because you can get

2564
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:12,880
away with a lot when you're strong

2565
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:15,520
uh-huh yes you can

2566
01:25:12,880 --> 01:25:16,719
so if your mind is strong enough to

2567
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,840
where you can just

2568
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,639
turn off that advantage and be a

2569
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,560
beginner

2570
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,000
truly in a particular art that's

2571
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:26,080
probably the best way to do it but you

2572
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,920
can get away and then you don't learn

2573
01:25:26,079 --> 01:25:31,359
yeah yeah it's hard uh

2574
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:32,960
it's hard not to use the little

2575
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:33,920
advantages you have because like jiu

2576
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:37,840
jitsu

2577
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:40,480
is a big hit on on the ego for

2578
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:41,360
you know especially guys you know when

2579
01:25:40,479 --> 01:25:45,039
like a smaller

2580
01:25:41,359 --> 01:25:47,039
person just destroys you dominates you

2581
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:49,679
when you can i don't know deadlift

2582
01:25:47,039 --> 01:25:51,920
whatever number of pounds

2583
01:25:49,679 --> 01:25:53,600
and uh it's hard not to use that

2584
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:57,119
strength to then resist

2585
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,880
the slow the ultimate destruction by

2586
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:00,479
like 120 pound

2587
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:02,319
but that and that's why i recommend

2588
01:26:00,479 --> 01:26:03,759
developing the skill quality first

2589
01:26:02,319 --> 01:26:06,238
but it doesn't it doesn't mean that you

2590
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:07,600
can't i can't you can still do it so

2591
01:26:06,238 --> 01:26:10,638
that don't take it as like

2592
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:12,159
oh i can't go that direction that's fine

2593
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:13,760
but understand those things and then

2594
01:26:12,158 --> 01:26:15,119
also understand the jiu jitsu is

2595
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,199
additional load on the body

2596
01:26:15,119 --> 01:26:18,479
yeah so you have to you can't just add

2597
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:20,559
it on top yeah

2598
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:22,479
you've got to taper back the other

2599
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:23,520
you're going to have to make a i'm sorry

2600
01:26:22,479 --> 01:26:26,319
you may not want to hear

2601
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,040
it but you're not going to be able to do

2602
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:30,639
as much

2603
01:26:27,039 --> 01:26:33,920
and add that here yeah it's a compromise

2604
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:35,199
because your total volume still has to

2605
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,199
be there and there's not unfortunately

2606
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:39,198
not really a way to measure

2607
01:26:37,198 --> 01:26:40,719
what the jiu-jitsu volume is with this

2608
01:26:39,198 --> 01:26:42,158
so you've got to

2609
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:43,679
take a look at that and that's where

2610
01:26:42,158 --> 01:26:45,439
like measuring like heart rate

2611
01:26:43,679 --> 01:26:47,760
variability or other stuff

2612
01:26:45,439 --> 01:26:50,000
can be useful so you can see what is

2613
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,679
happening from me from a sympathetic

2614
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:53,119
versus parasympathetic nerve nervous

2615
01:26:51,679 --> 01:26:54,639
system standpoint yeah making sure your

2616
01:26:53,119 --> 01:26:56,880
body recovers sufficiently

2617
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:58,560
and trying to put numbers to it you

2618
01:26:56,880 --> 01:27:01,119
mentioned kabuki strength

2619
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:02,719
you run the kabuki strength lab

2620
01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:04,479
previously called the elite performance

2621
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:07,840
center in oregon

2622
01:27:04,479 --> 01:27:08,718
you called it the perfect gym what makes

2623
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:11,039
uh for

2624
01:27:08,719 --> 01:27:12,480
the perfect strength training gym where

2625
01:27:11,039 --> 01:27:15,119
i called it the program in the video

2626
01:27:12,479 --> 01:27:17,839
somewhere i watched oh man

2627
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:19,439
i mean that's where my testing grounds

2628
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,319
for developing all this stuff was

2629
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:22,879
through the years

2630
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:25,119
and and so this is like i said i started

2631
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:27,520
developing relationships with

2632
01:27:25,119 --> 01:27:28,399
the best developmental kinesiologist in

2633
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:30,239
the in the us

2634
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:31,599
the best arguably the best or most

2635
01:27:30,238 --> 01:27:33,279
well-known physical therapist in the

2636
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,199
world the best

2637
01:27:33,279 --> 01:27:36,960
spine biomechanist in the world i

2638
01:27:35,198 --> 01:27:38,638
started doing continuing education with

2639
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,359
these clinical courses and learning this

2640
01:27:38,639 --> 01:27:41,520
stuff and going

2641
01:27:39,359 --> 01:27:42,960
but how does it work in my world right

2642
01:27:41,520 --> 01:27:44,400
and then i started lecturing with them

2643
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:46,719
and all this other stuff but

2644
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:47,599
the lab was like where do we test this

2645
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,439
stuff right

2646
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:52,320
and so let me get to a point there's

2647
01:27:49,439 --> 01:27:56,638
three things there's always three things

2648
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:58,238
so um to be a success

2649
01:27:56,639 --> 01:28:00,000
to achieve success i believe there's

2650
01:27:58,238 --> 01:28:01,198
three things that really really come

2651
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:05,600
into place

2652
01:28:01,198 --> 01:28:08,559
and it's the right methodology

2653
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:09,840
the right tools and the right

2654
01:28:08,560 --> 01:28:13,199
environment

2655
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:16,159
and so it was all about building that

2656
01:28:13,198 --> 01:28:16,719
and so the methodologies came from a lot

2657
01:28:16,158 --> 01:28:19,759
of that

2658
01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:22,239
different that gray area interaction of

2659
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:24,400
clinical with sports science right

2660
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:26,559
and then the tools i had to start

2661
01:28:24,399 --> 01:28:29,679
creating and designing and then

2662
01:28:26,560 --> 01:28:31,360
the environment is having this you know

2663
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:32,800
focused environment of people that want

2664
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:33,519
to do better and push each other and

2665
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,159
having

2666
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,639
community and culture right i end up

2667
01:28:36,158 --> 01:28:38,158
building

2668
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:39,600
these connections this network

2669
01:28:38,158 --> 01:28:41,119
everything that i'm doing with my

2670
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:43,920
businesses

2671
01:28:41,119 --> 01:28:45,279
is trying to create that into a scalable

2672
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,319
fashion and so i'm building the

2673
01:28:45,279 --> 01:28:48,559
groundwork because

2674
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:50,079
to have a system that like yeah i had

2675
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:52,159
clinicals on site that knew

2676
01:28:50,079 --> 01:28:54,000
exactly what we were doing and when it's

2677
01:28:52,158 --> 01:28:54,960
me and a few people in a small team and

2678
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,359
all this stuff

2679
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,880
we're all just like easy to manage and

2680
01:28:57,359 --> 01:28:59,759
you can see these there's other models

2681
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,520
around this so

2682
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:02,960
i've been other areas since maybe

2683
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,760
whenever it was i filmed that video

2684
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:07,039
that said that that they have that same

2685
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:08,480
same model and it's taken

2686
01:29:07,039 --> 01:29:10,319
probably about a decade usually to

2687
01:29:08,479 --> 01:29:11,759
develop that you know and

2688
01:29:10,319 --> 01:29:13,519
having the right people in this

2689
01:29:11,760 --> 01:29:15,199
community they can create this

2690
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,800
this network and the tool and all this

2691
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:18,479
stuff right except they still don't have

2692
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,279
the best tools because kabuki strength

2693
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:22,718
didn't exist

2694
01:29:19,279 --> 01:29:25,279
um but uh but

2695
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,719
and so out of that was is essentially

2696
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:28,559
started building

2697
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:30,239
this business and people like when did

2698
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,679
you know how all this stuff was

2699
01:29:30,238 --> 01:29:33,359
connected and i'm like

2700
01:29:31,679 --> 01:29:35,119
i don't know i didn't i just started

2701
01:29:33,359 --> 01:29:36,799
creating on the outset

2702
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:39,119
the things that worked until finally i'm

2703
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:41,920
like oh i'm recreating

2704
01:29:39,119 --> 01:29:43,359
a scalable version of this stuff here's

2705
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:45,359
the methodologies and a coaching

2706
01:29:43,359 --> 01:29:47,039
platform that we can manage clients

2707
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:48,399
around the globe and see what's working

2708
01:29:47,039 --> 01:29:50,000
and not based on the scientific

2709
01:29:48,399 --> 01:29:51,679
principles of training right

2710
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:53,119
how do we create that into a database

2711
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:55,359
that now we can train

2712
01:29:53,119 --> 01:29:57,279
new coaches and they can use those same

2713
01:29:55,359 --> 01:29:58,479
metrics and tools to create programs

2714
01:29:57,279 --> 01:30:00,880
that are tailored to fit

2715
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:02,559
a person's individual needs right now

2716
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,800
how do we integrate that with

2717
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,679
um assessment and clinical care

2718
01:30:04,800 --> 01:30:08,079
assessment and

2719
01:30:05,679 --> 01:30:09,279
and all these other pieces so there's a

2720
01:30:08,079 --> 01:30:11,198
lot of work in that

2721
01:30:09,279 --> 01:30:12,479
and so that's where kabuki strength is

2722
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:16,399
the genesis but we have

2723
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:19,039
we call our gym the kabuki strength lab

2724
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:20,238
literally people find about our gym in

2725
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:21,039
the neighborhood like how long have you

2726
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:22,718
been here why

2727
01:30:21,039 --> 01:30:24,800
why do i not know about this we don't

2728
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:28,560
advertise our gym at all

2729
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:30,800
i feel like that makes no sense well

2730
01:30:28,560 --> 01:30:32,239
it's because the only reason is to have

2731
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:34,079
a testing environment

2732
01:30:32,238 --> 01:30:35,279
for the tools and methodology and having

2733
01:30:34,079 --> 01:30:37,679
enough people to have

2734
01:30:35,279 --> 01:30:39,679
the culture and fit and to be able to be

2735
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:41,520
part of the experiment

2736
01:30:39,679 --> 01:30:44,000
what about the environment of the the

2737
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:46,719
feel of it the actual gym

2738
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,679
there's a i don't know a grunginess to

2739
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:49,359
it

2740
01:30:47,679 --> 01:30:51,760
i recently became a member of planet

2741
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:51,759
fitness

2742
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:56,480
for for reasons that have to do more

2743
01:30:54,639 --> 01:30:58,639
with the heat in austin that sometimes i

2744
01:30:56,479 --> 01:31:00,479
need to put in time on the treadmill

2745
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:02,000
uh i don't like i don't have any

2746
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:05,919
judgment honestly i don't the best

2747
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:07,920
gyms i've been in are kind of dirty

2748
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,520
you walk in and you know that work is to

2749
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,399
be done yes there's not another reason

2750
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:13,280
to do there

2751
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:14,879
it is the the environment is tight

2752
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:18,158
there's a big piece of that

2753
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:20,000
um i know it's studied sociologically i

2754
01:31:18,158 --> 01:31:22,158
believe i just i just pictured that word

2755
01:31:20,000 --> 01:31:22,158
too

2756
01:31:22,399 --> 01:31:25,920
but the intensity when you start growing

2757
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,960
a space

2758
01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:30,880
the intensity drops and so

2759
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:33,039
i i had that experience when we grew we

2760
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:34,639
went from a 4 000 foot to a 9 000 square

2761
01:31:33,039 --> 01:31:37,679
foot gym at one time

2762
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,400
and everybody's like it doesn't feel the

2763
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:39,760
same like

2764
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,279
people are complaining for years we've

2765
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,199
shrunk it back down when we're down to 3

2766
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:45,279
500 square feet and it creates

2767
01:31:43,198 --> 01:31:47,039
that intensity it creates the closest

2768
01:31:45,279 --> 01:31:47,439
the connection with the people around

2769
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:49,279
you

2770
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:51,678
and then like i said the the grunginess

2771
01:31:49,279 --> 01:31:53,359
like you go in you know the intention

2772
01:31:51,679 --> 01:31:54,719
when you walk in that environment

2773
01:31:53,359 --> 01:31:55,839
creates that tension but when i speak

2774
01:31:54,719 --> 01:31:58,319
environment it's not just the

2775
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:59,360
it's not the physical it's the people

2776
01:31:58,319 --> 01:32:02,158
but you know when the

2777
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:03,439
gym is a little bit beat up yes it also

2778
01:32:02,158 --> 01:32:06,719
tells a story

2779
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:08,000
like there's a history to it you could

2780
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:10,399
tell that not only

2781
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,439
is there work to be done that work has

2782
01:32:10,399 --> 01:32:13,439
been done here

2783
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:15,039
yes like battles have been fought

2784
01:32:13,439 --> 01:32:18,238
there's something to that where

2785
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:21,920
you're just in a long line of people

2786
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:23,198
you know that uh fought and won

2787
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:24,399
and we could get into a whole other

2788
01:32:23,198 --> 01:32:26,158
space so this would be a whole other

2789
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:28,479
topic but

2790
01:32:26,158 --> 01:32:30,399
that existing energy of a space i mean

2791
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:32,319
uh we mentioned offline joe rogan he

2792
01:32:30,399 --> 01:32:34,079
talks about the same with comedy clubs

2793
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:35,840
there's certain there's certain clubs

2794
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:38,479
that just have a history

2795
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,960
there's an energy there you can get all

2796
01:32:38,479 --> 01:32:41,119
woo

2797
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,158
but you know there is it's there it's a

2798
01:32:41,119 --> 01:32:43,920
real thing i think

2799
01:32:42,158 --> 01:32:45,679
you walk in and you can feel it and you

2800
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:49,679
feel you feel it

2801
01:32:45,679 --> 01:32:51,920
yeah that makes me feel that somehow

2802
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,199
all of us humans are connected in ways

2803
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:56,719
that's hard to describe

2804
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:59,759
even the ones who are no longer here

2805
01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:00,719
just the greatness that once was is

2806
01:32:59,760 --> 01:33:04,239
still

2807
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:06,560
in the walls in the space present there

2808
01:33:04,238 --> 01:33:07,519
yeah and we somehow can plug into that

2809
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:10,639
energy yeah

2810
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:11,920
it's we can go down and

2811
01:33:10,639 --> 01:33:14,079
go down a path there there's something

2812
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:14,800
really powerful there you've also

2813
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:17,279
mentioned

2814
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:18,320
a bunch of cool equipment that you've

2815
01:33:17,279 --> 01:33:21,279
developed as part of

2816
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:22,399
kabuki strength probably a little bit of

2817
01:33:21,279 --> 01:33:24,800
that has to do with your

2818
01:33:22,399 --> 01:33:26,799
engineering education but also just

2819
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,119
generally with the spirit

2820
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,719
of the uh innovator that you are what

2821
01:33:29,119 --> 01:33:33,119
are some cool

2822
01:33:30,719 --> 01:33:35,039
maybe uh revolutionary pieces of

2823
01:33:33,119 --> 01:33:37,119
equipment that you're particularly proud

2824
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,880
of or just uh

2825
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:41,439
you've been obsessed with recently yeah

2826
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:43,520
developing love to talk about that so

2827
01:33:41,439 --> 01:33:46,238
we've got some wild crazy stuff that

2828
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:49,199
just came out and is coming out too

2829
01:33:46,238 --> 01:33:51,119
so everything that we create and release

2830
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:54,158
a kabuki strength

2831
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:56,238
the industry hasn't seen before

2832
01:33:54,158 --> 01:33:57,759
there's stuff that's basic foundational

2833
01:33:56,238 --> 01:34:00,079
that's been around forever because it

2834
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:03,440
works

2835
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:04,158
but there's always more it could be

2836
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:05,919
better

2837
01:34:04,158 --> 01:34:07,599
and why are we not looking at these

2838
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:08,800
things these foundational things so

2839
01:34:07,600 --> 01:34:10,480
when people are coming up with novel

2840
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,760
things they end up being way different

2841
01:34:10,479 --> 01:34:12,238
outside the perspective and i'm coming

2842
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:14,480
up with

2843
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:15,599
things that are way different that are

2844
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:17,599
plays

2845
01:34:15,600 --> 01:34:19,120
on what we already know works so we

2846
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,560
talked about the transform bar the only

2847
01:34:19,119 --> 01:34:22,000
bar in the world we can manipulate

2848
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:25,039
spinal mechanics

2849
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:27,039
we can so everything everything for me

2850
01:34:25,039 --> 01:34:30,000
from a design concept that we develop

2851
01:34:27,039 --> 01:34:31,600
is all about creating products that can

2852
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:36,079
rapidly accommodate

2853
01:34:31,600 --> 01:34:39,199
to the variability of an individual's

2854
01:34:36,079 --> 01:34:41,359
leverages mobility

2855
01:34:39,198 --> 01:34:42,638
and training needs okay and that's going

2856
01:34:41,359 --> 01:34:44,639
to also create and

2857
01:34:42,639 --> 01:34:45,679
distill down the size and scope of space

2858
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:47,679
that we need which is

2859
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:49,679
going to be continue to be an ongoing

2860
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:51,279
thing check out my instagram after this

2861
01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:52,239
and you'll see i put an entire gym on

2862
01:34:51,279 --> 01:34:55,039
the bed of my truck

2863
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:56,718
and went on vacation uh last week we

2864
01:34:55,039 --> 01:34:59,519
drove to the desert oh no

2865
01:34:56,719 --> 01:35:01,279
and by entire gym i mean uh squat rack

2866
01:34:59,520 --> 01:35:03,520
full complement of our specialty bars a

2867
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:06,079
horizontal and vertical pulley system

2868
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:06,719
handheld weights shoulder like a

2869
01:35:06,079 --> 01:35:09,198
complete

2870
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:11,198
an entire gym in product that took up

2871
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:14,158
the space the size of this bed

2872
01:35:11,198 --> 01:35:15,919
right here that's incredible because of

2873
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:17,759
the design scope of what we have

2874
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:19,118
so the cool things that there's two

2875
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,119
other bars that

2876
01:35:19,118 --> 01:35:22,399
fit our biomechanically sound barbell

2877
01:35:21,118 --> 01:35:23,279
lines we talked about the transformer

2878
01:35:22,399 --> 01:35:25,679
bar

2879
01:35:23,279 --> 01:35:27,679
the other two are built on this thing i

2880
01:35:25,679 --> 01:35:31,118
call playground physics

2881
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:34,158
so we have these bars with handles

2882
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:36,319
that are off um off parallel

2883
01:35:34,158 --> 01:35:38,238
with the axis so they've been around the

2884
01:35:36,319 --> 01:35:42,000
market for a long time one is a

2885
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:44,959
hex bar or a trap bar another one is a

2886
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,158
it's a pressing bar with uh the handles

2887
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:49,039
turned as well

2888
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:51,118
and both of them suck they're horrible

2889
01:35:49,039 --> 01:35:51,439
any time any lifter knows if you pick it

2890
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:52,880
up

2891
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:55,359
it's going to break your wrist and crush

2892
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:58,560
into your face and it just

2893
01:35:55,359 --> 01:36:00,319
it just doesn't feel good pressing but

2894
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:01,679
it alleviates the strain on the wrist so

2895
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:04,719
people use it for that reason

2896
01:36:01,679 --> 01:36:06,719
and the the the trap bar same thing it's

2897
01:36:04,719 --> 01:36:08,480
always diving forward in your hand so

2898
01:36:06,719 --> 01:36:10,079
it's kind of limited it's also limited

2899
01:36:08,479 --> 01:36:11,599
in use

2900
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:13,279
because you can't you could do a lot

2901
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,800
more with it so these bars are really

2902
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:19,679
cool playground physics

2903
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:22,800
so as soon as the center of rotation

2904
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:26,158
is on the same axis as the

2905
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:28,239
center of mass and the handle

2906
01:36:26,158 --> 01:36:30,638
is off center you have you have a

2907
01:36:28,238 --> 01:36:32,559
teeter-totter

2908
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:34,719
so and a teeter-totter has a balance

2909
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:36,159
point but it's infinitely perfect so

2910
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:37,118
technically you can never find it it's

2911
01:36:36,158 --> 01:36:38,638
always going to be sitting on one side

2912
01:36:37,118 --> 01:36:40,238
or the other in a playground

2913
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:42,239
and that's what these bars are designed

2914
01:36:40,238 --> 01:36:43,439
so you got in instability right here you

2915
01:36:42,238 --> 01:36:44,718
can't find the center the bar is always

2916
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:45,118
trying to tip in your hands on the trap

2917
01:36:44,719 --> 01:36:46,480
bar

2918
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:47,679
so you can't do carries with it because

2919
01:36:46,479 --> 01:36:48,158
you're doing forward momentum and it

2920
01:36:47,679 --> 01:36:50,800
wants to

2921
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:52,638
it wants to dip on you right um the

2922
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:55,279
swiss bar wants to crush your face well

2923
01:36:52,639 --> 01:36:58,319
what do we do we just make a swing put

2924
01:36:55,279 --> 01:37:01,359
center of mass below center of rotation

2925
01:36:58,319 --> 01:37:02,559
and what does it do oh it always finds

2926
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:04,880
center

2927
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,840
so so the handles on the our pressing

2928
01:37:04,880 --> 01:37:07,679
bar

2929
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,039
it's arced so the handles are above

2930
01:37:07,679 --> 01:37:11,840
center of rotation

2931
01:37:09,039 --> 01:37:14,079
and then and then every angle instead of

2932
01:37:11,840 --> 01:37:16,239
just being a certain fixed angles

2933
01:37:14,079 --> 01:37:18,000
each angle is based on the width the

2934
01:37:16,238 --> 01:37:20,479
average width of an individual so the

2935
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,198
internal and external rotational bias is

2936
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:23,039
based

2937
01:37:21,198 --> 01:37:24,479
of the shoulder is based on the width

2938
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:25,519
leaving just a little bit left because

2939
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:26,879
we talked about the lat being a

2940
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:28,560
stabilizer you still need to have a

2941
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,359
little bit of q of external rotation to

2942
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,600
engage

2943
01:37:29,359 --> 01:37:32,880
that as a stabilizer boom now all of a

2944
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,880
sudden you have a bar and i kid you not

2945
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:36,560
this is a great story

2946
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:38,159
major league baseball when i presented

2947
01:37:36,560 --> 01:37:40,400
it every head strength coach for a major

2948
01:37:38,158 --> 01:37:42,158
league baseball team maybe not every but

2949
01:37:40,399 --> 01:37:44,079
damn near most of them have bad

2950
01:37:42,158 --> 01:37:46,000
shoulders they can't press they've got

2951
01:37:44,079 --> 01:37:47,359
shoulder surgeries so on and so we're

2952
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:48,800
showing they love all our stuff and i'm

2953
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:49,920
like hey i've got this cool prototype i

2954
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:52,079
want to show you it's a pressing bar and

2955
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:53,039
they're like oh you know

2956
01:37:52,079 --> 01:37:55,439
major league baseball's a little

2957
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:56,399
hesitant on pressing because the dangers

2958
01:37:55,439 --> 01:37:58,799
for the shoulder

2959
01:37:56,399 --> 01:38:00,638
and i i can't i haven't been able to

2960
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:02,719
take a bar to my chest i mean i'd really

2961
01:38:00,639 --> 01:38:05,520
love to it's been five years since i've

2962
01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:06,639
i've been able to uh to xx train and i'm

2963
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,400
like

2964
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:09,760
just try it like i can't even get a bar

2965
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:11,198
to my chest without pain like just try

2966
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,960
it

2967
01:38:11,198 --> 01:38:15,198
that feels good now the arc makes it

2968
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:16,639
actually three inches deeper

2969
01:38:15,198 --> 01:38:17,839
so people are automatically scared i

2970
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:19,440
can't do that because that's an extra

2971
01:38:17,840 --> 01:38:20,880
range of motion right

2972
01:38:19,439 --> 01:38:22,719
like oh put a plate on there they're

2973
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:23,840
doing it by the time the staff's like

2974
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:25,520
they're all standing around

2975
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,760
you see like what's going on put two

2976
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:30,480
plates on you see the

2977
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,840
just like it gets up how do you feel

2978
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:35,039
like

2979
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:35,600
i feel fine no pain at all yeah i did

2980
01:38:35,039 --> 01:38:38,479
this

2981
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:38,960
with five teams with five of the it

2982
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:42,399
happening

2983
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:43,760
repeatedly five times and that

2984
01:38:42,399 --> 01:38:46,399
they and every one of them worked up the

2985
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:48,639
two plates and did the reps varied

2986
01:38:46,399 --> 01:38:49,759
with zero pain to a three inch range of

2987
01:38:48,639 --> 01:38:50,159
greater range of mass because what did

2988
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,360
we do

2989
01:38:50,158 --> 01:38:52,719
we stacked all the joints and we

2990
01:38:51,359 --> 01:38:53,679
provided stability at the end we

2991
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:54,239
balanced the internal and external

2992
01:38:53,679 --> 01:38:57,039
rotation

2993
01:38:54,238 --> 01:38:58,158
i mean just basic playground physics and

2994
01:38:57,039 --> 01:39:00,238
it changed the game

2995
01:38:58,158 --> 01:39:01,920
now we get a greater range of motion

2996
01:39:00,238 --> 01:39:03,519
with a greater training effect with the

2997
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:06,000
negative stresses removed

2998
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:07,360
our trap bar opened up one side which

2999
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:07,760
there was already something like that

3000
01:39:07,359 --> 01:39:10,960
out there

3001
01:39:07,760 --> 01:39:12,239
created um it pops up so you can pick up

3002
01:39:10,960 --> 01:39:13,439
take the weights on and off it's got a

3003
01:39:12,238 --> 01:39:15,599
built-in jack

3004
01:39:13,439 --> 01:39:16,799
and then created the high handle

3005
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:18,320
position which already did everybody

3006
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,840
uses the high handle on a trap bar they

3007
01:39:18,319 --> 01:39:21,519
just don't know why they like it

3008
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:22,960
the handle that's on center we offset

3009
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:24,639
just a little bit not enough to make a

3010
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:26,719
difference on the range of motion lift

3011
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:28,560
or even notice visibly but it still has

3012
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:30,000
the same effect so both handles now have

3013
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:31,760
that

3014
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:33,279
we added the option of different handle

3015
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:35,920
sizes based on whatever your needs are

3016
01:39:33,279 --> 01:39:37,679
even the one that rolls to develop a

3017
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,800
grip and then different widths that you

3018
01:39:37,679 --> 01:39:40,000
could choose from based on whether

3019
01:39:38,800 --> 01:39:42,880
you're training a teen athlete

3020
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,679
or a seven foot six nba player or a nfl

3021
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:45,920
lineman

3022
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,600
um so that we can accommodate for all

3023
01:39:45,920 --> 01:39:49,440
these uh differences

3024
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,639
and so and then now it becomes the most

3025
01:39:49,439 --> 01:39:52,960
functional all-around bar

3026
01:39:50,639 --> 01:39:54,880
around because now you can do carries

3027
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,480
with it you can do split squats with it

3028
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:58,000
you could do curls with it because it

3029
01:39:56,479 --> 01:39:59,439
goes around the body you can do overhead

3030
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:00,560
presses because you don't have a thing

3031
01:39:59,439 --> 01:40:01,599
that gets in your way and you can flip

3032
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:04,000
it up into position

3033
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,679
you can do bent over rows and not run

3034
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:07,359
into your shins you can do seal rows off

3035
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:09,118
of a bench you can do ab roll outs

3036
01:40:07,359 --> 01:40:10,399
you could should i go on yeah so you

3037
01:40:09,118 --> 01:40:12,238
could use it as like the main

3038
01:40:10,399 --> 01:40:13,519
the best multi-purpose bar around you

3039
01:40:12,238 --> 01:40:15,439
got a home gym one bar

3040
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:17,040
like how do you develop totally new

3041
01:40:15,439 --> 01:40:20,158
equipment like this i uh

3042
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:22,399
scratch it on paper maybe

3043
01:40:20,158 --> 01:40:23,679
maybe weld some cut up and weld up a

3044
01:40:22,399 --> 01:40:26,000
prototype but usually i just

3045
01:40:23,679 --> 01:40:27,440
hand the scratched up paper to my uh

3046
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:29,198
engineering manager

3047
01:40:27,439 --> 01:40:30,719
and that's what he says his job is to

3048
01:40:29,198 --> 01:40:32,000
distill my chicken scratch into

3049
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:33,679
something real

3050
01:40:32,000 --> 01:40:35,600
and then that team picks it up uh but in

3051
01:40:33,679 --> 01:40:36,239
the old days starting out i just walk

3052
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:39,360
out

3053
01:40:36,238 --> 01:40:40,638
i just walk out and do it i you talk

3054
01:40:39,359 --> 01:40:42,000
about engineering i'm actually more i

3055
01:40:40,639 --> 01:40:44,639
work more of an artist fashion it's in

3056
01:40:42,000 --> 01:40:46,800
my head and i just go create

3057
01:40:44,639 --> 01:40:48,880
with no plans and so they have to pick

3058
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,159
that up and actually do the engineering

3059
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,600
and testing and all that

3060
01:40:50,158 --> 01:40:53,279
and then we got two other products came

3061
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,480
out this year freaking wild are you

3062
01:40:53,279 --> 01:40:55,840
familiar with uh training with a

3063
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:58,959
flywheel

3064
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:00,079
no no it's a flywheel maybe a flywheel

3065
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,800
is a spinning object

3066
01:41:00,079 --> 01:41:04,399
that uh creates an inertial mass yeah

3067
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:06,159
and then it reverses direction

3068
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:07,839
so whatever you put into it and there's

3069
01:41:06,158 --> 01:41:10,399
one's out there um

3070
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,119
but ours is the first patent pending

3071
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:13,439
that's all

3072
01:41:11,118 --> 01:41:15,359
everything all in one unit so it's a

3073
01:41:13,439 --> 01:41:16,879
floor based as well as a horizontal so

3074
01:41:15,359 --> 01:41:17,519
you can basically do any pulley movement

3075
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:19,520
in the world

3076
01:41:17,520 --> 01:41:20,880
and now everything that you put into it

3077
01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:21,920
on a concentric force it whips right

3078
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:24,719
back is

3079
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:26,480
is centric load gosh sure so there's an

3080
01:41:24,719 --> 01:41:29,840
accelerating whipping motion

3081
01:41:26,479 --> 01:41:30,399
it just yeah basically yeah i mean okay

3082
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,960
i have to

3083
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:34,479
have trouble imagining exactly many of

3084
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:36,880
the things you're describing

3085
01:41:34,479 --> 01:41:37,759
i i suppose have to be experienced right

3086
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:39,679
yes

3087
01:41:37,760 --> 01:41:41,119
so it's imaginable and there's a lot of

3088
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:43,199
research they've been around they're

3089
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:44,799
adopted more heavily in europe quite

3090
01:41:43,198 --> 01:41:45,678
heavily in europe but not as much in the

3091
01:41:44,800 --> 01:41:46,880
us

3092
01:41:45,679 --> 01:41:48,399
because they sell them as a be-all

3093
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:49,760
end-all tool which they're not they're

3094
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:52,638
crazy for what they do

3095
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,760
but it's not the it's another tool and

3096
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:56,159
so we have

3097
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,600
um a very high quality unit now that is

3098
01:41:56,158 --> 01:41:58,559
half the cost of everybody else's

3099
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,320
because

3100
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:02,080
the innovation of a movable mount point

3101
01:42:00,319 --> 01:42:05,279
that you for them you have to have

3102
01:42:02,079 --> 01:42:06,880
two pieces of equipment we have one so

3103
01:42:05,279 --> 01:42:08,800
um and then a few other things better

3104
01:42:06,880 --> 01:42:11,199
platform to be able to do things and

3105
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:13,119
that we can do what we call off platform

3106
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:16,238
work which allows us to do

3107
01:42:13,118 --> 01:42:16,960
movements like uh punches and stand-ups

3108
01:42:16,238 --> 01:42:18,238
things like that

3109
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:20,399
and then i've got a handheld weight

3110
01:42:18,238 --> 01:42:21,359
coming out next month that we can

3111
01:42:20,399 --> 01:42:24,000
actually play with

3112
01:42:21,359 --> 01:42:25,359
so varying the load with it never

3113
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:28,079
leaving your hand by changing the

3114
01:42:25,359 --> 01:42:28,079
leverage point

3115
01:42:30,238 --> 01:42:34,000
we're talking about here anything that

3116
01:42:31,760 --> 01:42:34,800
would be a a dumbbell or a kettlebell

3117
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:36,560
movement

3118
01:42:34,800 --> 01:42:38,159
so it functions it does the function of

3119
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,280
a kettlebell a dumbbell and what we call

3120
01:42:38,158 --> 01:42:40,960
a center mass bell

3121
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:42,399
as well as provides variable loading

3122
01:42:40,960 --> 01:42:45,198
within a range so

3123
01:42:42,399 --> 01:42:46,799
how can you change like how can you

3124
01:42:45,198 --> 01:42:48,319
change the load

3125
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:50,639
because the load well we don't actually

3126
01:42:48,319 --> 01:42:52,559
change the load we change the torque

3127
01:42:50,639 --> 01:42:54,239
on the on the joint that we're working

3128
01:42:52,560 --> 01:42:56,080
which is the same that's actually what

3129
01:42:54,238 --> 01:42:57,359
is creating the force right so if i'm

3130
01:42:56,079 --> 01:43:00,238
doing a front raise

3131
01:42:57,359 --> 01:43:02,319
it's where this this downward force is

3132
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:04,638
times the distance away right

3133
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:05,840
which also then makes it no force when

3134
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,359
i've got at the bottom of the front ways

3135
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:10,079
which is why it's so easy

3136
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:11,439
with this it's like a kettlebell it's

3137
01:43:10,079 --> 01:43:12,559
offset except it has three different

3138
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:14,158
handles

3139
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,760
but it's offset just a kettlebell you

3140
01:43:14,158 --> 01:43:17,599
can't do it because the offset so far it

3141
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,760
becomes a wrist movement

3142
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,119
so ours has three different sizes in the

3143
01:43:19,760 --> 01:43:22,880
offset just enough

3144
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:24,399
so that you can pick if i put it in the

3145
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:26,319
front raised position or curl position i

3146
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:28,479
could put it in outward position

3147
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:30,479
and the force is almost what it is at

3148
01:43:28,479 --> 01:43:32,158
the at the top but then i get the top

3149
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:33,919
and it's the same exact or the curl

3150
01:43:32,158 --> 01:43:35,439
so i can actually change the force curve

3151
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,800
in the movement and then

3152
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:38,238
i can just release the pressure a little

3153
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:39,840
bit and let it swing into position and

3154
01:43:38,238 --> 01:43:40,399
keep doing a drop set with never letting

3155
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,000
it down

3156
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:43,599
yeah yeah so it's got a really nice

3157
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,880
textured grip that allows you to hold it

3158
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:46,800
in different positions

3159
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:48,480
and then the load offset is just enough

3160
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:50,079
that it doesn't overpower the wrist

3161
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:51,919
and then you got different hand sizes so

3162
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:52,559
that you can maximize this relationship

3163
01:43:51,920 --> 01:43:54,800
and hit

3164
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:55,760
whatever joint that you're applying that

3165
01:43:54,800 --> 01:43:57,360
sounds incredible

3166
01:43:55,760 --> 01:43:58,719
it's really freaking well it's awesome

3167
01:43:57,359 --> 01:43:59,439
because you can because the variable

3168
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:00,880
load

3169
01:43:59,439 --> 01:44:03,118
now i could go straight from front

3170
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:04,719
raises to side raises or rear or curl

3171
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:06,238
because without like because i don't

3172
01:44:04,719 --> 01:44:07,118
have to put it down so now my time under

3173
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:09,198
tension

3174
01:44:07,118 --> 01:44:10,719
goes through the roof and by the way the

3175
01:44:09,198 --> 01:44:11,919
same effect with a flywheel trainer

3176
01:44:10,719 --> 01:44:13,118
because the variable res

3177
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:15,359
whatever you put into it is what it

3178
01:44:13,118 --> 01:44:17,039
kicks back so you have

3179
01:44:15,359 --> 01:44:18,399
an constant time under tension because

3180
01:44:17,039 --> 01:44:20,158
there's no rest points either so all

3181
01:44:18,399 --> 01:44:21,118
this stuff is working on maximizing time

3182
01:44:20,158 --> 01:44:24,158
under tension

3183
01:44:21,118 --> 01:44:24,719
um which anyway it it's that's cool

3184
01:44:24,158 --> 01:44:28,079
stuff

3185
01:44:24,719 --> 01:44:29,359
anyway i get i get excited uh well let

3186
01:44:28,079 --> 01:44:30,559
me ask you about another thing you've

3187
01:44:29,359 --> 01:44:31,920
already mentioned but

3188
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:35,840
i find this really interesting which is

3189
01:44:31,920 --> 01:44:35,840
barefoot running and

3190
01:44:36,079 --> 01:44:39,760
your sort of uh company barefoot

3191
01:44:39,039 --> 01:44:43,600
athletics

3192
01:44:39,760 --> 01:44:44,960
yeah b-e-a-r and the tagline is

3193
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:46,800
optimizing the human

3194
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:48,319
to ground interface we've talked about

3195
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:51,440
this a little bit

3196
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:52,719
with uh the power lifting how do you

3197
01:44:51,439 --> 01:44:57,678
think about

3198
01:44:52,719 --> 01:45:01,840
the the foot ground interface

3199
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:04,719
it's interesting that we know

3200
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:06,719
that we should train all these parts of

3201
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:10,239
our body to be able to be stronger

3202
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:13,840
be more resilient like

3203
01:45:10,238 --> 01:45:15,919
but we think that the foot is different

3204
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:17,600
that we need to package it and modify it

3205
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:18,560
and somehow that that's the science of

3206
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,920
making

3207
01:45:18,560 --> 01:45:22,320
you know it healthy where i challenge

3208
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,480
people

3209
01:45:22,319 --> 01:45:25,920
think about that like first thing you do

3210
01:45:24,479 --> 01:45:26,959
in the morning is

3211
01:45:25,920 --> 01:45:28,399
roll out of bed and put your

3212
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,079
weightlifting belt on and wrap it on

3213
01:45:28,399 --> 01:45:30,879
tight and wear it till you go to bed at

3214
01:45:30,079 --> 01:45:32,960
night

3215
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,880
do it with your shoulders your knees

3216
01:45:32,960 --> 01:45:36,960
wake up and put some knee wraps on

3217
01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,400
okay and elbow wraps and see what

3218
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,880
happens

3219
01:45:38,399 --> 01:45:42,000
one you'll get weaker you'll lose

3220
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:43,600
movement capacity

3221
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,198
and you'll start affecting other areas

3222
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:47,039
of the body very negatively because they

3223
01:45:45,198 --> 01:45:48,799
will start picking up the compensation

3224
01:45:47,039 --> 01:45:50,719
for those joints that are not moving

3225
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:53,840
properly

3226
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:55,679
this is it what shoes are for

3227
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:57,279
is to protect you from the environment

3228
01:45:55,679 --> 01:46:00,079
from cuts and abrasions

3229
01:45:57,279 --> 01:46:01,599
and heat and things like that but the

3230
01:46:00,079 --> 01:46:04,719
foot

3231
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:05,920
let me the mind blowing is like every

3232
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:09,039
other

3233
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:10,639
area of the body you need to use it and

3234
01:46:09,039 --> 01:46:12,158
you need to strengthen it and you need

3235
01:46:10,639 --> 01:46:14,000
to learn to control it

3236
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:15,920
that's it that's all i have to say about

3237
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,880
the subject okay

3238
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:19,279
it's that simple but somehow we have

3239
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:21,760
been

3240
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:23,679
sold entire industries like the

3241
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:25,920
orthotics industry

3242
01:46:23,679 --> 01:46:27,840
it's completely false meta-analysis of

3243
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:29,359
the data shows that orthotics do nothing

3244
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,960
beyond temporary relief

3245
01:46:29,359 --> 01:46:33,039
from pain over a six eight week period

3246
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,800
of time and provide no long-term benefit

3247
01:46:33,039 --> 01:46:37,920
and i can't tell you how many people

3248
01:46:34,800 --> 01:46:39,520
i've eliminated back or knee or hip pain

3249
01:46:37,920 --> 01:46:40,960
from getting from working on

3250
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:42,560
strengthening and controlling the foot

3251
01:46:40,960 --> 01:46:45,279
and ankle complex

3252
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:46,000
we believe we've villainized and said a

3253
01:46:45,279 --> 01:46:49,840
low arch

3254
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,840
is a condition that needs fixed

3255
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:54,319
like when it really is just controlling

3256
01:46:52,639 --> 01:46:56,159
the foot and ankle complex and how they

3257
01:46:54,319 --> 01:46:57,118
relate to each other and how we use that

3258
01:46:56,158 --> 01:46:59,839
is it like

3259
01:46:57,118 --> 01:47:01,519
go put on boxing gloves in the morning

3260
01:46:59,840 --> 01:47:02,319
and do that for the next 20 years and

3261
01:47:01,520 --> 01:47:03,920
see what happens

3262
01:47:02,319 --> 01:47:06,079
it's not about finding the right shoe

3263
01:47:03,920 --> 01:47:07,359
that fits because your foot has been

3264
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:09,760
deformed

3265
01:47:07,359 --> 01:47:11,519
and so i'm not like some wacky goo like

3266
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,960
oh you got to be barefoot forever do

3267
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:16,239
this like no i'm just saying

3268
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:16,480
go spend some time using it strengthen

3269
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:18,000
it

3270
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:19,519
learn to control it and you'll work

3271
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,118
better in a shoe but

3272
01:47:19,520 --> 01:47:23,040
the whole running shoe movement with the

3273
01:47:21,118 --> 01:47:26,000
raised heel that was

3274
01:47:23,039 --> 01:47:26,238
the person that that suggested that that

3275
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:28,319
in

3276
01:47:26,238 --> 01:47:29,439
to nike way back when they were trying

3277
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:32,319
to figure out what to do

3278
01:47:29,439 --> 01:47:34,399
the reason and he says it's it's the

3279
01:47:32,319 --> 01:47:37,599
worst thing that he ever did

3280
01:47:34,399 --> 01:47:39,359
um because we were coming from an

3281
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:41,360
era of people wearing heeled shoes which

3282
01:47:39,359 --> 01:47:42,719
by the way came from um

3283
01:47:41,359 --> 01:47:44,079
stirrups way back in the day that's

3284
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:45,039
where the whole heel came from is to go

3285
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:45,920
into stirrup but then it went into

3286
01:47:45,039 --> 01:47:47,439
fashion and then

3287
01:47:45,920 --> 01:47:49,199
the running craze started coming around

3288
01:47:47,439 --> 01:47:50,559
in the

3289
01:47:49,198 --> 01:47:52,158
they're 70s they're starting to push

3290
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,679
this the general mass population and

3291
01:47:52,158 --> 01:47:55,679
they realize that they were causing

3292
01:47:53,679 --> 01:47:57,199
injuries and like what are we gonna do

3293
01:47:55,679 --> 01:47:58,158
well that's because everybody was in

3294
01:47:57,198 --> 01:48:00,158
this position

3295
01:47:58,158 --> 01:48:01,439
and had a shortened uh shortened calf

3296
01:48:00,158 --> 01:48:03,039
muscle it's like well the work around

3297
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:05,839
let's just put a heel on it so we don't

3298
01:48:03,039 --> 01:48:08,158
injure them

3299
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:10,400
that's it and now because the raised

3300
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:12,319
heel you got to raise the toe and then

3301
01:48:10,399 --> 01:48:14,319
now with that if you go stand on

3302
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:16,238
something and pull your inner toe in

3303
01:48:14,319 --> 01:48:17,920
and in a squat position just reach down

3304
01:48:16,238 --> 01:48:18,718
and do it you'll see that you have no

3305
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:20,480
control

3306
01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:22,319
over the internal and external rotation

3307
01:48:20,479 --> 01:48:24,959
of your of of your leg

3308
01:48:22,319 --> 01:48:27,599
you don't and or your foot and you

3309
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:29,679
actually have to put a support in

3310
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:32,880
for the arch to be able to passively

3311
01:48:29,679 --> 01:48:35,118
control those structures

3312
01:48:32,880 --> 01:48:36,239
it's just band-aid on top of band-aid on

3313
01:48:35,118 --> 01:48:38,000
top of band-aid

3314
01:48:36,238 --> 01:48:39,279
use it strengthen it if you want to wear

3315
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:41,198
some shoes because they look good or

3316
01:48:39,279 --> 01:48:42,880
fancy i'm like i have no problem i mean

3317
01:48:41,198 --> 01:48:44,479
i got a wife my wife will put on some

3318
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:48,000
high heels every now and again

3319
01:48:44,479 --> 01:48:49,678
like but all i'm saying is use your foot

3320
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,600
my thousand pound squat my thousand

3321
01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:53,679
pound deadlift we're done barefoot i'm

3322
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:56,480
not trying to sell you shoes

3323
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:57,199
go do it with no shoe that's what i've

3324
01:48:56,479 --> 01:48:58,799
been promoting

3325
01:48:57,198 --> 01:49:01,519
i did that for six years and i promoted

3326
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:03,119
it but people ask me like

3327
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,800
what do i do because my gym requires

3328
01:49:03,118 --> 01:49:07,439
shoes

3329
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:08,400
okay where do i go and uh and then i go

3330
01:49:07,439 --> 01:49:09,759
well

3331
01:49:08,399 --> 01:49:11,519
you know you could pick up these uh

3332
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:13,039
other finger shoes or whatever and they

3333
01:49:11,520 --> 01:49:16,000
go man

3334
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:16,639
my wife won't have sex with me and i go

3335
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:18,639
i know

3336
01:49:16,639 --> 01:49:19,760
mine either like trust me i'm not making

3337
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:21,279
this up

3338
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,800
everybody in that market markets to one

3339
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:23,519
segment and they're still missing some

3340
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:25,199
gaps

3341
01:49:23,520 --> 01:49:26,880
because they they still have a little

3342
01:49:25,198 --> 01:49:28,000
bit too narrow of a toe box and with

3343
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:29,599
your lifting you have the opportunity

3344
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,118
to really get that splay and start

3345
01:49:29,599 --> 01:49:33,920
working on this stuff better

3346
01:49:31,118 --> 01:49:35,198
so i just wanted to create a shoe these

3347
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:36,560
ones are odd colored because it's a

3348
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:38,719
partnership with kabuki

3349
01:49:36,560 --> 01:49:40,000
normally we've got a black or a gray low

3350
01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:41,520
top high top

3351
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:43,679
sticks to the ground for lifting so we

3352
01:49:41,520 --> 01:49:44,960
can do that and very pliable it's a

3353
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:47,118
moccasin

3354
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:48,639
it's a modern-day moccasin but looks

3355
01:49:47,118 --> 01:49:49,519
okay that you can wear it around in

3356
01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:51,840
other areas if you

3357
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:54,239
if you so choose like you know what the

3358
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:57,360
number one healthcare cost in america is

3359
01:49:54,238 --> 01:50:02,718
what's that diabetes

3360
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:02,719
uh heart disease cancer

3361
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:05,839
low back pain

3362
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:10,158
now what do you attribute low back pain

3363
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:10,719
to well it's attributed to a lot of

3364
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:12,799
things

3365
01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:14,319
um but inability to control spinal

3366
01:50:12,800 --> 01:50:16,560
position um which

3367
01:50:14,319 --> 01:50:18,880
starts happening from uh some breathing

3368
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:20,880
issues uh it also happens from

3369
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:22,639
the foot um so there's a lot of stuff

3370
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:25,520
but everything that i do actually

3371
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:26,719
focus on improving this yeah so that and

3372
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:28,239
it all starts with

3373
01:50:26,719 --> 01:50:29,920
this is one thing like this doesn't

3374
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:31,198
affect breathing but um

3375
01:50:29,920 --> 01:50:32,880
so it does actually affect breathing to

3376
01:50:31,198 --> 01:50:33,279
some elections and spinal stabilization

3377
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,440
so

3378
01:50:33,279 --> 01:50:36,960
the raised heel and toe will make you

3379
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:39,198
stride further

3380
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:40,319
because of just how it operates but that

3381
01:50:39,198 --> 01:50:43,678
over stride

3382
01:50:40,319 --> 01:50:44,960
is a result of opening this so we opened

3383
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:46,239
the pelvis and diaphragm did we talk

3384
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:47,760
about that and the impact that that has

3385
01:50:46,238 --> 01:50:48,879
for controlling in spine yeah i think we

3386
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:52,079
touched on that yeah

3387
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:54,000
um but it it's all this stuff plays

3388
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:55,679
together so the gate affects that and so

3389
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,920
the shoe affects the gate and then

3390
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:59,760
so it's all connected all connected let

3391
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:01,359
me be very

3392
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:03,599
purposeful with some conversation here

3393
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:06,079
though we've talked about periodization

3394
01:51:03,599 --> 01:51:07,599
this was a big gap so people go yeah

3395
01:51:06,079 --> 01:51:09,118
well when people started running with

3396
01:51:07,599 --> 01:51:11,679
those they started having injuries

3397
01:51:09,118 --> 01:51:13,279
back when the finger company produced

3398
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:14,719
those and didn't do the education around

3399
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:16,000
this very simple concept

3400
01:51:14,719 --> 01:51:18,000
you do not walk into the gym if you

3401
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:18,399
haven't squatted and start squatting 225

3402
01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:20,800
from

3403
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:21,519
for max rex every week day or every day

3404
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,599
over day

3405
01:51:21,520 --> 01:51:25,679
yeah and that's what people did because

3406
01:51:23,599 --> 01:51:27,840
they did weren't told that

3407
01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:29,039
you need to build the capacity to do

3408
01:51:27,840 --> 01:51:31,199
this

3409
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:32,719
you go wear these and walk around in

3410
01:51:31,198 --> 01:51:34,158
your office or wherever all day long

3411
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:36,639
your feet are gonna hurt they're gonna

3412
01:51:34,158 --> 01:51:36,638
be sore

3413
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:42,880
do it for 10 of your time yeah

3414
01:51:40,319 --> 01:51:44,399
do that for a month then add some that

3415
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:45,679
will build the capacity

3416
01:51:44,399 --> 01:51:47,598
to do this and then that's going to

3417
01:51:45,679 --> 01:51:48,800
start having the ability to strengthen

3418
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:50,480
manage the foot there's a whole lot of

3419
01:51:48,800 --> 01:51:52,400
other stuff i've got videos on

3420
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:53,759
things that you can do buy whatever you

3421
01:51:52,399 --> 01:51:56,399
want or just

3422
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:57,760
just spend some time out of them like

3423
01:51:56,399 --> 01:51:58,638
that's all that i want people to do

3424
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:01,360
because it is so

3425
01:51:58,639 --> 01:52:02,719
simple and it has such a profound impact

3426
01:52:01,359 --> 01:52:04,880
yeah it does i

3427
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,719
what i did uh i noticed when you walked

3428
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:08,079
uh when i walked in i was like oh hey

3429
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:10,639
you're spending some time without the

3430
01:52:08,079 --> 01:52:13,359
last shoes on

3431
01:52:10,639 --> 01:52:14,719
uh well what i did um i think it's

3432
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:16,799
already now two years ago when i was

3433
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:17,920
doing a lot of running i do like a 10

3434
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:19,840
mile run

3435
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:22,079
i would take my shoes off for the last

3436
01:52:19,840 --> 01:52:24,800
like half mile and i run like that

3437
01:52:22,079 --> 01:52:26,960
and that was for me really helpful to

3438
01:52:24,800 --> 01:52:29,199
ensure that i have proper form

3439
01:52:26,960 --> 01:52:30,960
form that minimizes pain on the way i

3440
01:52:29,198 --> 01:52:32,319
run i still like shoes

3441
01:52:30,960 --> 01:52:34,399
i benefit a lot from shoes the

3442
01:52:32,319 --> 01:52:37,439
protection they provide but

3443
01:52:34,399 --> 01:52:40,638
it's for running um we're referring to

3444
01:52:37,439 --> 01:52:41,839
especially trail lining and so on and in

3445
01:52:40,639 --> 01:52:43,359
the city when there's glass and all

3446
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,960
those kinds of things

3447
01:52:43,359 --> 01:52:46,880
but it's really important to have

3448
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:50,480
minimal sort of protection on your feet

3449
01:52:46,880 --> 01:52:53,679
for me at least it was to figure out

3450
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:56,079
the ways that my form basic movement

3451
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:57,520
and like the positioning in the foot the

3452
01:52:56,079 --> 01:52:59,760
impact of the foot

3453
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:01,119
and everything you know the the the

3454
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,599
lower leg

3455
01:53:01,118 --> 01:53:06,238
the entirety of the torso really how

3456
01:53:03,599 --> 01:53:08,480
it's improperly positioned

3457
01:53:06,238 --> 01:53:10,479
in terms for the objective of minimizing

3458
01:53:08,479 --> 01:53:11,519
pain and the barefoot running really

3459
01:53:10,479 --> 01:53:13,919
help

3460
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,960
uh fix that for me because i figured out

3461
01:53:13,920 --> 01:53:18,639
that i need to take

3462
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:20,319
shorter steps uh more frequent

3463
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:22,000
you know all those kinds of things and

3464
01:53:20,319 --> 01:53:24,639
that really helps you figure that out

3465
01:53:22,000 --> 01:53:25,359
like let's be realist about stuff like

3466
01:53:24,639 --> 01:53:28,719
um

3467
01:53:25,359 --> 01:53:31,279
spend some time using it strengthen it

3468
01:53:28,719 --> 01:53:32,800
and i've got some great ways to to do

3469
01:53:31,279 --> 01:53:34,880
that and learn how to do that so

3470
01:53:32,800 --> 01:53:36,079
yeah what is a good diet for strength

3471
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,840
development

3472
01:53:36,079 --> 01:53:40,079
i've uh just to give you some context

3473
01:53:37,840 --> 01:53:41,920
i've been eating mostly meat

3474
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:44,319
not for strength mostly for mental

3475
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:46,960
performance i just enjoy it

3476
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:47,519
yes you need to have a base level of

3477
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:50,319
protein

3478
01:53:47,520 --> 01:53:53,119
building blocks for tissue right we need

3479
01:53:50,319 --> 01:53:55,599
to have enough fats to be able to have

3480
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:56,238
hormones work and key processes in the

3481
01:53:55,599 --> 01:53:58,400
body

3482
01:53:56,238 --> 01:53:59,678
we need to have well you don't need to

3483
01:53:58,399 --> 01:54:01,279
have from a performance aspect

3484
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:02,800
carbohydrates necessarily because the

3485
01:54:01,279 --> 01:54:03,840
other ones can convert into injury

3486
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:06,079
sources but

3487
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:08,480
for a performance athlete carbohydrates

3488
01:54:06,079 --> 01:54:12,479
can be very beneficial

3489
01:54:08,479 --> 01:54:14,559
as well so so i look at it as

3490
01:54:12,479 --> 01:54:16,399
you want you need a base level fats you

3491
01:54:14,560 --> 01:54:17,199
need a base level of proteins and then

3492
01:54:16,399 --> 01:54:19,118
you adjust

3493
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:21,759
the carbohydrate intake based on the

3494
01:54:19,118 --> 01:54:23,839
needs i'm not anti-carbohydrate by any

3495
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:25,039
means

3496
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,639
because a lot of people will they look

3497
01:54:25,039 --> 01:54:27,760
at me now when they see like how lean i

3498
01:54:26,639 --> 01:54:29,520
am and they are they jump to a

3499
01:54:27,760 --> 01:54:30,960
conclusion you must be keto you must be

3500
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,239
carnivore you must be whatever and it's

3501
01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:35,039
like

3502
01:54:32,238 --> 01:54:36,000
so losing and gaining weight is simply

3503
01:54:35,039 --> 01:54:39,599
eating less

3504
01:54:36,000 --> 01:54:42,560
or eating more i mean it ah

3505
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:44,639
and we get so complicated oh that my fat

3506
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:47,440
they're like what's your fasting window

3507
01:54:44,639 --> 01:54:49,440
if i'm if i'm doing fasting it's just

3508
01:54:47,439 --> 01:54:50,960
because it works with my

3509
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:52,638
my environment sometimes i do it

3510
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:54,480
sometimes i don't

3511
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:55,920
all that does is control how much

3512
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:57,678
calories that you take

3513
01:54:55,920 --> 01:54:59,760
big success with keto and carnivore

3514
01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:02,158
diets it's hard to eat a lot

3515
01:54:59,760 --> 01:55:03,360
uh and and put on weight with those with

3516
01:55:02,158 --> 01:55:05,598
those diets

3517
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:06,880
um you know protein actually has a

3518
01:55:05,599 --> 01:55:09,119
thermogenic effect

3519
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:10,560
and so you have to have a massive amount

3520
01:55:09,118 --> 01:55:12,639
of fats if you have a

3521
01:55:10,560 --> 01:55:13,679
only meat diet because you can literally

3522
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:16,239
starve to death

3523
01:55:13,679 --> 01:55:17,599
there's a there's a show where they put

3524
01:55:16,238 --> 01:55:18,158
people out in the wilderness and this

3525
01:55:17,599 --> 01:55:19,360
guy

3526
01:55:18,158 --> 01:55:20,879
the one that won one of the ones i

3527
01:55:19,359 --> 01:55:22,399
looked in they threw him away like up in

3528
01:55:20,880 --> 01:55:24,079
the uh

3529
01:55:22,399 --> 01:55:25,598
past a lot you know out the way out

3530
01:55:24,079 --> 01:55:27,118
there there was nothing but he somehow

3531
01:55:25,599 --> 01:55:29,039
got a caribou and killed it

3532
01:55:27,118 --> 01:55:30,479
and he still lost a pound a day for 30

3533
01:55:29,039 --> 01:55:33,760
days with a caribou

3534
01:55:30,479 --> 01:55:35,279
because his fat was stolen by a uh uh

3535
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:37,119
and and he could eat all the meat he

3536
01:55:35,279 --> 01:55:38,960
wanted yeah and they he almost got

3537
01:55:37,118 --> 01:55:42,238
pulled because his weight lost right

3538
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:42,880
um but that isn't actually a performance

3539
01:55:42,238 --> 01:55:44,718
so those type

3540
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:46,000
keto and carnivore are not performance

3541
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:48,719
diets so

3542
01:55:46,000 --> 01:55:49,920
they're not going to be as effective at

3543
01:55:48,719 --> 01:55:52,880
supplying

3544
01:55:49,920 --> 01:55:54,239
the energy needs for high capacity

3545
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,920
training so don't get me wrong you can

3546
01:55:54,238 --> 01:55:58,238
do training but like

3547
01:55:55,920 --> 01:55:59,039
you can be a successful like elite

3548
01:55:58,238 --> 01:56:02,479
athlete

3549
01:55:59,039 --> 01:56:05,840
with a with a vegan diet but it's not

3550
01:56:02,479 --> 01:56:07,759
as easy to do it with other diets so

3551
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:09,599
and you're missing some base nutrients

3552
01:56:07,760 --> 01:56:13,440
so many nutrients in meat

3553
01:56:09,599 --> 01:56:15,119
i believe uh having greens in your diet

3554
01:56:13,439 --> 01:56:16,799
is really beneficial lots of research

3555
01:56:15,118 --> 01:56:18,319
but there's people in the other worlds

3556
01:56:16,800 --> 01:56:19,199
that argue that you don't need them but

3557
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:21,439
they help

3558
01:56:19,198 --> 01:56:22,960
clear organs provide micronutrients all

3559
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:25,598
this sort of stuff so

3560
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:27,118
i eat simply a whole well-rounded diet

3561
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:30,560
and i've gone from

3562
01:56:27,118 --> 01:56:31,359
i can go from 285 pounds squatting a ton

3563
01:56:30,560 --> 01:56:33,360
of weight

3564
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:35,118
to eating less and dropping all the way

3565
01:56:33,359 --> 01:56:36,799
down to you know seven eight percent

3566
01:56:35,118 --> 01:56:38,319
body fat with veins standing out

3567
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,960
everywhere without a

3568
01:56:38,319 --> 01:56:42,399
tissue on me just with amazing great

3569
01:56:40,960 --> 01:56:44,719
tasting food

3570
01:56:42,399 --> 01:56:46,000
to lose weight or be healthy does not

3571
01:56:44,719 --> 01:56:49,118
mean that you need to eat

3572
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:52,238
flavorless bland food so

3573
01:56:49,118 --> 01:56:53,279
that's the main thing portions it's eat

3574
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:55,279
less to lose weight

3575
01:56:53,279 --> 01:56:56,800
eat more to gain weight yep make sure

3576
01:56:55,279 --> 01:56:58,238
that you've got enough protein make sure

3577
01:56:56,800 --> 01:56:59,520
that you've got your micronutrients

3578
01:56:58,238 --> 01:57:01,039
covered which is going to cover by

3579
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:03,679
eating real food

3580
01:57:01,039 --> 01:57:05,519
don't go low fat no fat if you want a

3581
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:07,599
performance don't go no carb but if it

3582
01:57:05,520 --> 01:57:10,800
works any of those things

3583
01:57:07,599 --> 01:57:13,520
so diet approach when you look at diets

3584
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:14,239
understand that they're how aggressive

3585
01:57:13,520 --> 01:57:15,920
they are so

3586
01:57:14,238 --> 01:57:17,279
like keto can make you lose a lot of

3587
01:57:15,920 --> 01:57:19,359
weight carnivore can make you lose a lot

3588
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:22,399
of weight a lot of that up front

3589
01:57:19,359 --> 01:57:23,759
is actually dropping glycogen stores so

3590
01:57:22,399 --> 01:57:25,279
you're actually just reducing water in

3591
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:27,599
your muscle and fat tissue

3592
01:57:25,279 --> 01:57:29,039
um so which is why it doesn't isn't as

3593
01:57:27,599 --> 01:57:32,079
great for a performance diet

3594
01:57:29,039 --> 01:57:34,560
but understand that every diet

3595
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:35,359
also has a level of discipline and does

3596
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:38,639
it fit your

3597
01:57:35,359 --> 01:57:39,759
lifestyle so i suggest people don't find

3598
01:57:38,639 --> 01:57:41,359
a diet

3599
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:43,199
you need to find a lifestyle because

3600
01:57:41,359 --> 01:57:43,598
that's what's sustainable i hate the

3601
01:57:43,198 --> 01:57:47,919
word

3602
01:57:43,599 --> 01:57:51,360
diet to begin with what behaviors

3603
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:53,039
are sustainable and then do that

3604
01:57:51,359 --> 01:57:55,198
and then over time the things you'll get

3605
01:57:53,039 --> 01:57:58,479
to where you need to get

3606
01:57:55,198 --> 01:58:01,279
diet itself just by the name of it

3607
01:57:58,479 --> 01:58:02,079
is not sustainable because it it is a

3608
01:58:01,279 --> 01:58:05,118
short-term

3609
01:58:02,079 --> 01:58:07,118
thing to get somewhere yeah

3610
01:58:05,118 --> 01:58:08,880
i tend to try to measure it because i

3611
01:58:07,118 --> 01:58:10,799
definitely have a love-hate relationship

3612
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:13,599
with food

3613
01:58:10,800 --> 01:58:15,279
i tend to look back and say like by

3614
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:18,239
following this particular

3615
01:58:15,279 --> 01:58:20,238
protocol lifestyle whatever what was the

3616
01:58:18,238 --> 01:58:23,759
level of happiness

3617
01:58:20,238 --> 01:58:25,359
yes so not like weight loss or

3618
01:58:23,760 --> 01:58:26,719
weight gain or all those kinds of things

3619
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:27,598
it's the entirety of the picture

3620
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:29,599
productivity

3621
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:31,360
just feeling good throughout the day

3622
01:58:29,599 --> 01:58:33,119
socially also like yeah

3623
01:58:31,359 --> 01:58:35,759
interacting with people because so much

3624
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:37,598
of uh human connection like i mentioned

3625
01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:38,800
before is over food

3626
01:58:37,599 --> 01:58:40,800
and if you're going to limit yourself

3627
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:42,960
well in that regard you're limiting a

3628
01:58:40,800 --> 01:58:46,320
certain fundamental aspect of life

3629
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:49,679
a number of years ago um i did uh

3630
01:58:46,319 --> 01:58:51,039
like 20 to 22-hour fasts every day

3631
01:58:49,679 --> 01:58:52,719
and i'm like well this doesn't work i'm

3632
01:58:51,039 --> 01:58:54,158
i can't do business lunches and stuff

3633
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:55,679
like that so when i was in my fasting

3634
01:58:54,158 --> 01:58:56,799
thing i went to a 16 so i could have a

3635
01:58:55,679 --> 01:58:58,800
light lunch

3636
01:58:56,800 --> 01:59:01,599
just for the social aspect of it and

3637
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:03,199
perform a little perform that like

3638
01:59:01,599 --> 01:59:04,880
and then that's why and that's why like

3639
01:59:03,198 --> 01:59:06,319
the typical bodybuilding like the eight

3640
01:59:04,880 --> 01:59:08,239
meal a day diet

3641
01:59:06,319 --> 01:59:10,158
um has never worked for me because i've

3642
01:59:08,238 --> 01:59:11,519
always been a very bit like trying to

3643
01:59:10,158 --> 01:59:12,638
fit that between meetings and other

3644
01:59:11,520 --> 01:59:14,960
stuff

3645
01:59:12,639 --> 01:59:16,719
what that diet provides is it just you

3646
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:18,000
get less bloat and distension of a

3647
01:59:16,719 --> 01:59:19,279
larger meal

3648
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:21,920
but at the end of the day you get the

3649
01:59:19,279 --> 01:59:24,399
same exact results pick a lifestyle

3650
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:25,920
live that you can have really great

3651
01:59:24,399 --> 01:59:28,319
tasting food

3652
01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:29,760
and that to me is the same thing and

3653
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:30,079
this is why i'm like really hitting this

3654
01:59:29,760 --> 01:59:32,560
point

3655
01:59:30,079 --> 01:59:33,599
because also with the dieting and like

3656
01:59:32,560 --> 01:59:35,920
the approach like

3657
01:59:33,599 --> 01:59:37,679
oh i'm gonna do this and people pick

3658
01:59:35,920 --> 01:59:40,000
these chicken and broccoli

3659
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:41,760
recipes and guess what you're going to

3660
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:46,719
break if you do not in

3661
01:59:41,760 --> 01:59:50,400
if you do not enjoy it you will break

3662
01:59:46,719 --> 01:59:54,319
so that's it is a very important point

3663
01:59:50,399 --> 01:59:56,079
well i also slightly push back or maybe

3664
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:59,279
to elaborate

3665
01:59:56,079 --> 02:00:02,158
if you don't enjoy moderation

3666
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:03,840
for me particularly um i have trouble

3667
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:07,198
moderating certain things

3668
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:08,639
most foods i would say so my source of

3669
02:00:07,198 --> 02:00:11,439
happiness comes with

3670
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:14,079
foods even if they're bland the ones

3671
02:00:11,439 --> 02:00:15,839
that can enjoy but enjoy moderation

3672
02:00:14,079 --> 02:00:17,920
so there's i mean i enjoy every piece of

3673
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:19,039
food so it's like it's uh if you can

3674
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:22,399
enjoy

3675
02:00:19,039 --> 02:00:24,479
the the full lifestyle it's not just the

3676
02:00:22,399 --> 02:00:26,960
particular experience but like

3677
02:00:24,479 --> 02:00:27,919
the full journey yep does it fit your

3678
02:00:26,960 --> 02:00:30,960
lifestyle yeah

3679
02:00:27,920 --> 02:00:34,639
yeah so let me ask about uh

3680
02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:37,198
a complicated uh topic that's sometimes

3681
02:00:34,639 --> 02:00:38,400
a bit controversial which is steroids it

3682
02:00:37,198 --> 02:00:41,759
may be

3683
02:00:38,399 --> 02:00:43,118
a trt testosterone replacement therapy

3684
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:45,280
what role does that play in strength

3685
02:00:43,118 --> 02:00:46,880
training all right

3686
02:00:45,279 --> 02:00:48,479
we're gonna uh we're gonna go there

3687
02:00:46,880 --> 02:00:51,840
let's go uh yeah

3688
02:00:48,479 --> 02:00:54,479
but it's an important discussion to have

3689
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,279
um i think that uh it's something that i

3690
02:00:54,479 --> 02:00:58,638
can be

3691
02:00:55,279 --> 02:00:59,118
more transparent on um in my past i

3692
02:00:58,639 --> 02:01:01,920
wasn't

3693
02:00:59,118 --> 02:01:02,880
able to do to the career that i had so

3694
02:01:01,920 --> 02:01:05,199
just like

3695
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:07,118
covering that stuff in a you know one on

3696
02:01:05,198 --> 02:01:10,399
a public forum

3697
02:01:07,118 --> 02:01:12,319
when you're highly looked at

3698
02:01:10,399 --> 02:01:13,519
being an executive for recruiting and

3699
02:01:12,319 --> 02:01:16,960
other stuff like

3700
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:21,520
it was an area i had to just kind of

3701
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:24,639
pass on right now i've used steroids

3702
02:01:21,520 --> 02:01:28,560
i've used them since i was 33

3703
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:32,159
and i basically just used trt

3704
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:36,320
now after my big squat so for 10 years

3705
02:01:32,158 --> 02:01:39,359
i used them and there's some interesting

3706
02:01:36,319 --> 02:01:42,158
uh components to this so um

3707
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:43,759
one is just the the gray area of what we

3708
02:01:42,158 --> 02:01:46,799
call performance enhancing

3709
02:01:43,760 --> 02:01:47,920
supplements so uh performance was it

3710
02:01:46,800 --> 02:01:52,800
peds

3711
02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:56,158
um that the line of what defines a ped

3712
02:01:52,800 --> 02:01:57,119
is ever shifting and it's shifting based

3713
02:01:56,158 --> 02:01:59,359
on

3714
02:01:57,118 --> 02:02:01,198
society norms cultural norms government

3715
02:01:59,359 --> 02:02:02,960
bonding agencies all these sorts of

3716
02:02:01,198 --> 02:02:04,638
stuff so i'm not making excuses here so

3717
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:06,480
i just want to elaborate before i

3718
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:07,279
actually start digging into the details

3719
02:02:06,479 --> 02:02:10,079
here

3720
02:02:07,279 --> 02:02:10,719
because performance enhancing i could

3721
02:02:10,079 --> 02:02:13,840
take

3722
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:16,000
sodium bicarbonate and

3723
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:16,880
enhance my ability to perform deadlifts

3724
02:02:16,000 --> 02:02:18,399
for reps

3725
02:02:16,880 --> 02:02:20,079
guess what i did that for my guinness

3726
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:22,799
world record for deadlifts in a minute

3727
02:02:20,079 --> 02:02:25,118
okay people do it for rowing or other

3728
02:02:22,800 --> 02:02:28,480
they use high capacity uh

3729
02:02:25,118 --> 02:02:33,118
type stuff it is performance enhancing

3730
02:02:28,479 --> 02:02:35,919
it is a chemical it is baking soda

3731
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:37,198
all right um they're not able to make it

3732
02:02:35,920 --> 02:02:40,158
illegal because they

3733
02:02:37,198 --> 02:02:41,919
everybody eats bread well not everyone

3734
02:02:40,158 --> 02:02:45,039
and so it's a little hard to test

3735
02:02:41,920 --> 02:02:46,880
for no matter what you do at any level

3736
02:02:45,039 --> 02:02:49,599
so that's an extreme example

3737
02:02:46,880 --> 02:02:50,880
but other examples um you're drinking a

3738
02:02:49,599 --> 02:02:53,360
an energy drink in that

3739
02:02:50,880 --> 02:02:55,199
cup there a little while ago and in

3740
02:02:53,359 --> 02:02:57,759
america you can get an energy drink with

3741
02:02:55,198 --> 02:03:00,158
240 milligrams of caffeine in it

3742
02:02:57,760 --> 02:03:01,920
in canada that's too dangerous you can

3743
02:03:00,158 --> 02:03:05,359
only get 140

3744
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:06,960
but you can go buy ephedra and ephedra

3745
02:03:05,359 --> 02:03:08,479
is illegal in america

3746
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:10,319
and so these things bounce back and

3747
02:03:08,479 --> 02:03:14,158
forth all the time

3748
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:15,599
i could take yohimbi and in europe or

3749
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:18,960
australia

3750
02:03:15,599 --> 02:03:19,920
it is a drug and classified and america

3751
02:03:18,960 --> 02:03:23,118
it's

3752
02:03:19,920 --> 02:03:24,960
it is not it's a it's an herbal root

3753
02:03:23,118 --> 02:03:26,000
uh in a lot i actually haven't won one

3754
02:03:24,960 --> 02:03:27,840
of my supplements except for the

3755
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:29,840
overseas version

3756
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:30,960
anyway the point i'm getting is no

3757
02:03:29,840 --> 02:03:34,000
matter what you do

3758
02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:34,719
at some point there's by someone's

3759
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:38,800
standards

3760
02:03:34,719 --> 02:03:41,599
you are cheating and

3761
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:42,719
because it is you're taking something

3762
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:44,239
that

3763
02:03:42,719 --> 02:03:46,480
but you could work around these things

3764
02:03:44,238 --> 02:03:48,000
with nutritional ways or other ways

3765
02:03:46,479 --> 02:03:49,519
versus taking a chemical structure and

3766
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,920
there's a whole lot of ways to do this

3767
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:51,360
but

3768
02:03:49,920 --> 02:03:53,199
it's like oh no it's steroids it's not

3769
02:03:51,359 --> 02:03:55,839
it's injectable it's not well

3770
02:03:53,198 --> 02:03:57,359
somewhere there's a culture or a person

3771
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:59,360
that will say you're cheating no matter

3772
02:03:57,359 --> 02:04:00,719
what so it's a self-defined

3773
02:03:59,359 --> 02:04:01,920
you need to define it for yourself

3774
02:04:00,719 --> 02:04:02,880
unless you're competing in an

3775
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:04,960
organization

3776
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:06,000
that has testing then it's a straight

3777
02:04:04,960 --> 02:04:08,000
ethical

3778
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:09,599
uh thing and it's either right or wrong

3779
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:11,679
in my opinion

3780
02:04:09,599 --> 02:04:13,119
that's that's kind of the the overall

3781
02:04:11,679 --> 02:04:16,000
dilemma of it is

3782
02:04:13,118 --> 02:04:17,039
if you want to see what you're totally

3783
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:19,520
capable of

3784
02:04:17,039 --> 02:04:20,238
you have to decide decide yourself

3785
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:24,320
what's

3786
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:27,678
okay or not to to that level there is no

3787
02:04:24,319 --> 02:04:28,880
there is no body that can say something

3788
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:30,560
yes or no

3789
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:32,719
yeah when there's an event like the

3790
02:04:30,560 --> 02:04:34,320
olympics maybe then

3791
02:04:32,719 --> 02:04:35,920
you have a standard that you're all

3792
02:04:34,319 --> 02:04:37,840
trying to adhere to

3793
02:04:35,920 --> 02:04:39,760
and then it makes sense to keep a

3794
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:41,920
certain like to be within there's an

3795
02:04:39,760 --> 02:04:43,039
ethical there's no so yeah i'm not

3796
02:04:41,920 --> 02:04:45,599
talking about

3797
02:04:43,039 --> 02:04:47,279
that i'm agreeing to compete in this by

3798
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:48,239
these by these rules yeah but when

3799
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:51,118
you're trying to

3800
02:04:48,238 --> 02:04:52,000
maximize your own performance whatever

3801
02:04:51,118 --> 02:04:53,920
that journey is whatever

3802
02:04:52,000 --> 02:04:55,760
that goal is that's a different story

3803
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:56,560
and it's not it's not easy to figure

3804
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:58,719
that out

3805
02:04:56,560 --> 02:05:00,560
you go up you're just like dancing

3806
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:03,118
around the subject whatever

3807
02:05:00,560 --> 02:05:04,400
well guess what i've got a i've got a

3808
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:05,839
prescription for growth hormone and

3809
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:08,399
testosterone

3810
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:08,960
it's legal for me to take and you know

3811
02:05:08,399 --> 02:05:10,479
what

3812
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:12,480
a lot of the people that are in front of

3813
02:05:10,479 --> 02:05:14,959
the camera in the media

3814
02:05:12,479 --> 02:05:15,598
politicians and news people and the

3815
02:05:14,960 --> 02:05:18,639
people that

3816
02:05:15,599 --> 02:05:20,719
are there saying the the no drug stuff

3817
02:05:18,639 --> 02:05:22,719
they're going to anti-aging clinics to

3818
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:23,679
look better and they have a prescription

3819
02:05:22,719 --> 02:05:26,319
for growth hormone

3820
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:27,599
and testosterone themselves but in their

3821
02:05:26,319 --> 02:05:29,759
eyes

3822
02:05:27,599 --> 02:05:32,239
it's okay it is a prescription from

3823
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:36,320
their doctor because they have the money

3824
02:05:32,238 --> 02:05:39,759
to do it so it's legal

3825
02:05:36,319 --> 02:05:40,880
and it's fine if i it's interesting in

3826
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:42,239
oregon

3827
02:05:40,880 --> 02:05:46,319
anybody and i don't know what other

3828
02:05:42,238 --> 02:05:47,759
states over the age of 16

3829
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:50,158
can without parents permission by the

3830
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:52,159
way walk into a gender clinic

3831
02:05:50,158 --> 02:05:54,238
and as a female and get a prescription

3832
02:05:52,158 --> 02:05:57,439
for testosterone

3833
02:05:54,238 --> 02:05:58,959
but as an athlete if i've got low

3834
02:05:57,439 --> 02:06:02,238
testosterone

3835
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:04,000
i am so low i've got depression i

3836
02:06:02,238 --> 02:06:05,839
can't have sex with my wife it's

3837
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:08,158
affecting my quality of life

3838
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:09,520
i will have to fight tooth and nail to

3839
02:06:08,158 --> 02:06:11,359
get testosterone

3840
02:06:09,520 --> 02:06:12,880
just as a prescription and then i will

3841
02:06:11,359 --> 02:06:15,118
get kicked out of my organization for

3842
02:06:12,880 --> 02:06:17,599
competing

3843
02:06:15,118 --> 02:06:19,519
like so you understand how gray this

3844
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:22,800
stuff gets do you think the stigma

3845
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:24,719
on testosterone is the reason we're not

3846
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:26,159
having like a healthy conversation about

3847
02:06:24,719 --> 02:06:27,679
when it's proper

3848
02:06:26,158 --> 02:06:30,000
like what are the proper uses of

3849
02:06:27,679 --> 02:06:32,000
testosterone in an athlete's life in

3850
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,719
just a regular human life

3851
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,599
yeah absolutely i mean and it's just

3852
02:06:34,719 --> 02:06:38,078
it's like anything

3853
02:06:35,599 --> 02:06:39,760
it's like i said it is lines that we

3854
02:06:38,078 --> 02:06:41,118
pick and draw anytime you

3855
02:06:39,760 --> 02:06:42,480
put that out there people are going to

3856
02:06:41,118 --> 02:06:43,118
have different opinions where those

3857
02:06:42,479 --> 02:06:45,039
lines are

3858
02:06:43,118 --> 02:06:47,198
so now when it comes to strength here's

3859
02:06:45,039 --> 02:06:48,800
an interesting thing in powerlifting

3860
02:06:47,198 --> 02:06:50,399
there's tested federations and

3861
02:06:48,800 --> 02:06:52,320
non-tested federations so we can

3862
02:06:50,399 --> 02:06:55,279
literally look at the statistical data

3863
02:06:52,319 --> 02:06:56,319
and actually find out what do steroids

3864
02:06:55,279 --> 02:06:58,479
do

3865
02:06:56,319 --> 02:07:00,319
and so it's pretty clear that steroids

3866
02:06:58,479 --> 02:07:03,759
provide about a ten percent

3867
02:07:00,319 --> 02:07:06,158
increase in strength on average over

3868
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:07,440
not now that does take out the fact that

3869
02:07:06,158 --> 02:07:09,439
steroids will put you in

3870
02:07:07,439 --> 02:07:11,279
uh allow you to put on more mass so

3871
02:07:09,439 --> 02:07:13,839
you'll go up a weight class

3872
02:07:11,279 --> 02:07:15,039
a lot of times so as a whole you could

3873
02:07:13,840 --> 02:07:18,480
definitely lift

3874
02:07:15,039 --> 02:07:20,639
more probably than the 10 over time

3875
02:07:18,479 --> 02:07:23,039
right and then we think about steroids

3876
02:07:20,639 --> 02:07:25,039
as the ability to just put on muscle

3877
02:07:23,039 --> 02:07:26,560
and here's where things get a little

3878
02:07:25,039 --> 02:07:28,158
interesting even with people that use

3879
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:29,520
steroids is not understanding the

3880
02:07:28,158 --> 02:07:31,679
neurological impacts

3881
02:07:29,520 --> 02:07:32,960
that steroids have because you could

3882
02:07:31,679 --> 02:07:36,639
take some steroids

3883
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:38,880
right now and be stronger in 10 minutes

3884
02:07:36,639 --> 02:07:40,078
that's clearly not done anything you

3885
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:42,319
know from a physiology

3886
02:07:40,078 --> 02:07:43,519
standpoint to make you stronger but we

3887
02:07:42,319 --> 02:07:46,799
have a tapped in

3888
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:48,400
neurologically to to elicit those gains

3889
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:51,920
and there's a whole lot that happens

3890
02:07:48,399 --> 02:07:54,719
neurologically like how much science

3891
02:07:51,920 --> 02:07:56,158
is there in terms of all the different

3892
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:58,719
ways you could take steroids

3893
02:07:56,158 --> 02:07:59,839
which kinds of steroids the timing the

3894
02:07:58,719 --> 02:08:02,078
the dose

3895
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:03,599
the all of those things to develop the

3896
02:08:02,078 --> 02:08:04,799
the neurological the physical the

3897
02:08:03,599 --> 02:08:07,279
skeleton like all

3898
02:08:04,800 --> 02:08:09,119
all the you know you've talked with such

3899
02:08:07,279 --> 02:08:12,479
depth about the science

3900
02:08:09,118 --> 02:08:15,598
of strength building in terms of

3901
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:16,158
form uh in terms of the equipment that

3902
02:08:15,599 --> 02:08:19,440
you use

3903
02:08:16,158 --> 02:08:21,839
it seems like a component

3904
02:08:19,439 --> 02:08:23,279
you know the use of steroids should be

3905
02:08:21,840 --> 02:08:25,199
an equal

3906
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:26,479
level of scientific rigor when applying

3907
02:08:25,198 --> 02:08:29,519
them it is

3908
02:08:26,479 --> 02:08:32,799
now the research is harder to to get

3909
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:33,920
because of what it is um but there is a

3910
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:36,320
lot of research

3911
02:08:33,920 --> 02:08:37,279
that was done when they were legal so

3912
02:08:36,319 --> 02:08:38,960
they were legal up in

3913
02:08:37,279 --> 02:08:40,719
through the uh through i think the mid

3914
02:08:38,960 --> 02:08:44,399
80s and so

3915
02:08:40,719 --> 02:08:47,599
a lot of the classical um high

3916
02:08:44,399 --> 02:08:48,479
high benefit to low risk steroids were

3917
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:50,078
studied

3918
02:08:48,479 --> 02:08:52,078
and then since then there's a lot of

3919
02:08:50,078 --> 02:08:53,279
like designer steroids or new steroids

3920
02:08:52,078 --> 02:08:56,158
that have come up that

3921
02:08:53,279 --> 02:08:56,800
don't have a lot of research around

3922
02:08:56,158 --> 02:08:58,399
safety

3923
02:08:56,800 --> 02:09:00,480
and risk and things of that nature and

3924
02:08:58,399 --> 02:09:02,638
we can't do that because it's

3925
02:09:00,479 --> 02:09:04,158
you know because of the legality around

3926
02:09:02,639 --> 02:09:05,279
these things

3927
02:09:04,158 --> 02:09:07,598
but some of the stuff on the

3928
02:09:05,279 --> 02:09:09,679
neurological function is really

3929
02:09:07,599 --> 02:09:10,880
just understanding how that chemical

3930
02:09:09,679 --> 02:09:13,599
structure uh

3931
02:09:10,880 --> 02:09:16,880
works and what it's doing to the

3932
02:09:13,599 --> 02:09:20,400
neurotransmitters what it's doing

3933
02:09:16,880 --> 02:09:22,639
and so some of it is is really talking

3934
02:09:20,399 --> 02:09:23,598
to people that have experience with it

3935
02:09:22,639 --> 02:09:25,199
um

3936
02:09:23,599 --> 02:09:26,880
and the other is understanding those

3937
02:09:25,198 --> 02:09:29,439
structures and what they do

3938
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:31,440
the neurological component i think is

3939
02:09:29,439 --> 02:09:34,638
more interesting than

3940
02:09:31,439 --> 02:09:36,319
than most because the most steroids act

3941
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:38,639
through increasing muscle protein

3942
02:09:36,319 --> 02:09:41,599
synthesis that's how you add more muscle

3943
02:09:38,639 --> 02:09:43,920
is they have an anti-catabolic effect

3944
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:46,480
and they have a muscle protein synthesis

3945
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:48,158
enhancing effect so it reduces the

3946
02:09:46,479 --> 02:09:49,598
amount of muscle that you waste and

3947
02:09:48,158 --> 02:09:51,279
increases the amount of muscle that you

3948
02:09:49,599 --> 02:09:54,639
put on

3949
02:09:51,279 --> 02:09:57,759
but the neurological component

3950
02:09:54,639 --> 02:09:58,239
is is tremendously valuable for what it

3951
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:00,960
can do

3952
02:09:58,238 --> 02:10:02,638
for your training workout like if i

3953
02:10:00,960 --> 02:10:05,118
handle more load over time

3954
02:10:02,639 --> 02:10:06,319
i'm going to make more progress if i can

3955
02:10:05,118 --> 02:10:08,078
actually just stimulate more

3956
02:10:06,319 --> 02:10:08,639
neurological effects for a specific

3957
02:10:08,078 --> 02:10:11,679
event

3958
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:13,440
it's going to have an impact right but

3959
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:14,239
there's other ways that you can tap into

3960
02:10:13,439 --> 02:10:16,000
this too

3961
02:10:14,238 --> 02:10:17,919
things that you can tap into mentally

3962
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:18,800
with great practice with meditation and

3963
02:10:17,920 --> 02:10:21,760
other stuff that

3964
02:10:18,800 --> 02:10:22,880
will have the same effect people

3965
02:10:21,760 --> 02:10:23,520
probably think i'm over speaking

3966
02:10:22,880 --> 02:10:25,760
especially

3967
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:27,599
steroid users that are listening to this

3968
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:31,599
at least i'm talking out my ass

3969
02:10:27,599 --> 02:10:34,239
but i'm not because i i

3970
02:10:31,599 --> 02:10:35,840
i have experience with this stuff on

3971
02:10:34,238 --> 02:10:37,359
both ends and some of those areas a lot

3972
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:40,000
of people don't have

3973
02:10:37,359 --> 02:10:40,559
the experience with that what i've kind

3974
02:10:40,000 --> 02:10:43,520
of

3975
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:46,400
heard from people is the the confidence

3976
02:10:43,520 --> 02:10:48,800
that comes with steroids it feels like

3977
02:10:46,399 --> 02:10:50,799
not to call it placebo but it seems like

3978
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:51,679
the psychological benefits of steroids

3979
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:54,800
is huge

3980
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:55,679
and that you feel like uh there's a

3981
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:58,000
confidence

3982
02:10:55,679 --> 02:11:00,399
that seems to be uh coupled with the

3983
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:02,078
actual biological and chemical effects

3984
02:11:00,399 --> 02:11:04,238
i have a actually a neurological

3985
02:11:02,078 --> 02:11:05,840
condition um so i actually don't

3986
02:11:04,238 --> 02:11:07,039
feel a lot of that stuff that people

3987
02:11:05,840 --> 02:11:09,840
because there's certain steroids that

3988
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:09,840
like people will like

3989
02:11:09,920 --> 02:11:14,239
you're like very extreme ones um

3990
02:11:13,039 --> 02:11:16,158
like that would make somebody bite

3991
02:11:14,238 --> 02:11:16,638
someone's ear off in a fight for example

3992
02:11:16,158 --> 02:11:20,000
yeah

3993
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:21,520
um aggression that and

3994
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:23,359
they'll literally do nothing i'm like

3995
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:26,639
always just chilling and

3996
02:11:23,359 --> 02:11:28,880
they don't like effect

3997
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:30,319
but but neurologically they're still

3998
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:31,520
having those effects but i don't get

3999
02:11:30,319 --> 02:11:34,799
those feels that

4000
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:37,520
other people uh have from those but yes

4001
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:38,320
there's that immediate boost in

4002
02:11:37,520 --> 02:11:39,679
aggression

4003
02:11:38,319 --> 02:11:41,039
and the confidence and stuff that come

4004
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:42,719
with a lot of those ones that deal on

4005
02:11:41,039 --> 02:11:44,719
the neurological

4006
02:11:42,719 --> 02:11:46,560
overall a good sense of well-being just

4007
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:49,359
like from being on testosterone like

4008
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:51,280
it's going to affect your mood and it's

4009
02:11:49,359 --> 02:11:52,158
interesting so testosterone replacement

4010
02:11:51,279 --> 02:11:53,679
therapy

4011
02:11:52,158 --> 02:11:55,920
if we walk down that path now and kind

4012
02:11:53,679 --> 02:11:58,560
of switch gears

4013
02:11:55,920 --> 02:12:00,239
you know we find that men today have

4014
02:11:58,560 --> 02:12:02,400
declining testosterone

4015
02:12:00,238 --> 02:12:03,439
over what has historically been in the

4016
02:12:02,399 --> 02:12:06,000
past so

4017
02:12:03,439 --> 02:12:07,039
right now i think a 35 year old

4018
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,880
testosterone

4019
02:12:07,039 --> 02:12:14,319
is shown to be about half what it was

4020
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:16,078
just 50 years ago so i don't know if

4021
02:12:14,319 --> 02:12:18,000
we could argue the point we don't really

4022
02:12:16,078 --> 02:12:18,559
have the science to validate any of it

4023
02:12:18,000 --> 02:12:21,760
but

4024
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:23,440
it could be uh society as far as the

4025
02:12:21,760 --> 02:12:26,480
impact that it's having on the

4026
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:28,479
mental uh health uh for

4027
02:12:26,479 --> 02:12:30,000
men it could be the the estrogens

4028
02:12:28,479 --> 02:12:32,319
floating around in the water

4029
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:33,679
from all the chemicals and birth control

4030
02:12:32,319 --> 02:12:36,319
and all this sort of stuff could be a

4031
02:12:33,679 --> 02:12:38,399
lot of things

4032
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:40,559
but it is a fact that average

4033
02:12:38,399 --> 02:12:42,799
testosterone is significantly lower

4034
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:43,599
and that is going to end up affecting

4035
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,880
life

4036
02:12:43,599 --> 02:12:47,199
quality of life as well as your

4037
02:12:44,880 --> 02:12:48,639
longevity because it will affect those

4038
02:12:47,198 --> 02:12:51,279
things but on the other end

4039
02:12:48,639 --> 02:12:52,960
steroids and trt particularly steroids

4040
02:12:51,279 --> 02:12:54,078
come with a lot of negative health

4041
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:56,000
benefits

4042
02:12:54,078 --> 02:12:57,679
not benefits a lot of negative health

4043
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:00,319
ramifications

4044
02:12:57,679 --> 02:13:01,039
and so you know if i knew what i know

4045
02:13:00,319 --> 02:13:02,399
now

4046
02:13:01,039 --> 02:13:04,479
i don't know that i would have gone that

4047
02:13:02,399 --> 02:13:06,078
path i didn't i didn't tell i was 33

4048
02:13:04,479 --> 02:13:07,519
which is kind of an outlier for a

4049
02:13:06,078 --> 02:13:10,000
strength athlete um

4050
02:13:07,520 --> 02:13:12,320
i was i was a four times body weight

4051
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:15,520
deadlifter 800 plus pounds at

4052
02:13:12,319 --> 02:13:16,399
198 and it's pretty dang strong uh

4053
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:19,280
before i

4054
02:13:16,399 --> 02:13:20,319
went down that path uh and that's

4055
02:13:19,279 --> 02:13:22,158
because i wanted to see what i was

4056
02:13:20,319 --> 02:13:22,479
capable of but i was reaching a point

4057
02:13:22,158 --> 02:13:24,479
that

4058
02:13:22,479 --> 02:13:26,319
it was either i need to do that or not

4059
02:13:24,479 --> 02:13:26,959
my testosterone my natural testosterone

4060
02:13:26,319 --> 02:13:30,078
levels

4061
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:32,078
were actually um i think below 300

4062
02:13:30,078 --> 02:13:34,078
is actually the threshold so i was being

4063
02:13:32,078 --> 02:13:35,599
told to go on trt for the last

4064
02:13:34,078 --> 02:13:37,359
couple years probably just because i was

4065
02:13:35,599 --> 02:13:38,719
pushing so hard and the stress level was

4066
02:13:37,359 --> 02:13:39,598
driving my test down so it was

4067
02:13:38,719 --> 02:13:42,480
self-imposed

4068
02:13:39,599 --> 02:13:43,520
more than likely but i put it off

4069
02:13:42,479 --> 02:13:44,000
because i wanted to set all the

4070
02:13:43,520 --> 02:13:46,400
drug-free

4071
02:13:44,000 --> 02:13:48,000
records and i set the ones that i wanted

4072
02:13:46,399 --> 02:13:49,759
and then it was 33 i'm

4073
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:52,078
you know entering the age category and

4074
02:13:49,760 --> 02:13:55,119
i'm like i'm going to go on trt

4075
02:13:52,078 --> 02:13:57,118
i did not feel like i should be with trt

4076
02:13:55,118 --> 02:13:58,880
personally my ethical standard was i

4077
02:13:57,118 --> 02:13:59,920
shouldn't be competing in tested events

4078
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:01,760
anymore

4079
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:03,679
um there are federations that will allow

4080
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:05,039
you with your you show up with your

4081
02:14:03,679 --> 02:14:06,560
script and you do your test and you're

4082
02:14:05,039 --> 02:14:07,359
below a certain level but you're still

4083
02:14:06,560 --> 02:14:09,199
on

4084
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:10,559
which but for me i'm like that's not

4085
02:14:09,198 --> 02:14:13,359
over you won't come so i'm like i may as

4086
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:16,800
well at this point use steroids

4087
02:14:13,359 --> 02:14:18,479
um but since then you know understanding

4088
02:14:16,800 --> 02:14:20,400
all those ramifications

4089
02:14:18,479 --> 02:14:22,158
uh you know i might not have gone down

4090
02:14:20,399 --> 02:14:26,399
that route quite so fast

4091
02:14:22,158 --> 02:14:28,238
and easily but i continued because i

4092
02:14:26,399 --> 02:14:30,319
also have a lot of resources that other

4093
02:14:28,238 --> 02:14:32,000
people don't in being able to assess and

4094
02:14:30,319 --> 02:14:33,599
understand and put things in place to

4095
02:14:32,000 --> 02:14:35,679
mitigate that so you need to be

4096
02:14:33,599 --> 02:14:38,960
and the other thing is once you go on

4097
02:14:35,679 --> 02:14:42,639
it's literally a decision for life

4098
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:45,039
not neces but realistically is because

4099
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:47,440
your your quality of life your feeling

4100
02:14:45,039 --> 02:14:48,960
is going to be enhanced quite a bit

4101
02:14:47,439 --> 02:14:50,559
and you're not going to want to go back

4102
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:52,800
and if you go back it's going to be less

4103
02:14:50,560 --> 02:14:54,719
than it was before

4104
02:14:52,800 --> 02:14:56,159
that's how the endocrine system works

4105
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:58,319
there are ways to try to recover and

4106
02:14:56,158 --> 02:14:59,759
bring that up but it might be a while

4107
02:14:58,319 --> 02:15:01,840
and if you've been on for a while it

4108
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:04,079
definitely is not an option

4109
02:15:01,840 --> 02:15:06,239
so those are big things that people need

4110
02:15:04,078 --> 02:15:07,279
to understand that you're going to have

4111
02:15:06,238 --> 02:15:10,718
some things in there

4112
02:15:07,279 --> 02:15:13,599
and even trt has some potential

4113
02:15:10,719 --> 02:15:14,880
especially with at higher levels that

4114
02:15:13,599 --> 02:15:17,279
it's going to

4115
02:15:14,880 --> 02:15:17,920
you know increase the risk for prostate

4116
02:15:17,279 --> 02:15:21,519
cancer

4117
02:15:17,920 --> 02:15:23,279
it's going to potentially cause some

4118
02:15:21,520 --> 02:15:24,719
hypertrophy of the left ventricle of the

4119
02:15:23,279 --> 02:15:26,319
heart and some potential

4120
02:15:24,719 --> 02:15:27,679
plaque buildup of the some of those key

4121
02:15:26,319 --> 02:15:29,039
arteries around there that's going to

4122
02:15:27,679 --> 02:15:30,800
have an impact on

4123
02:15:29,039 --> 02:15:32,078
your cardiovascular health there's

4124
02:15:30,800 --> 02:15:34,320
things that you can do

4125
02:15:32,078 --> 02:15:37,118
again but everything is like the shoe

4126
02:15:34,319 --> 02:15:38,799
story right where i'm anti-anti-shu

4127
02:15:37,118 --> 02:15:42,319
but i'm going well we can put band-aids

4128
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:43,679
on this yeah um so it's

4129
02:15:42,319 --> 02:15:45,599
there's a quality of life that comes

4130
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:47,599
with it the increase in quality of life

4131
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:49,279
and if you do it correctly i think and i

4132
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:51,440
think for me for me i definitely would

4133
02:15:49,279 --> 02:15:52,559
not live without trt even with knowing

4134
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:55,678
what i know now

4135
02:15:52,560 --> 02:15:58,320
um it this age and the quality of life

4136
02:15:55,679 --> 02:15:59,039
and being able to be there have the

4137
02:15:58,319 --> 02:16:01,439
energy

4138
02:15:59,039 --> 02:16:02,639
the recovery that's a big thing where

4139
02:16:01,439 --> 02:16:05,118
all this so i talked about

4140
02:16:02,639 --> 02:16:07,359
muscle protein synthesis and

4141
02:16:05,118 --> 02:16:10,559
anti-catabolism as being big drivers

4142
02:16:07,359 --> 02:16:12,319
but recovery is the other big aspect

4143
02:16:10,560 --> 02:16:13,920
that they that they offer probably as a

4144
02:16:12,319 --> 02:16:16,238
result of those but

4145
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:18,158
um that's gonna those are gonna be the

4146
02:16:16,238 --> 02:16:21,359
big enhancements so

4147
02:16:18,158 --> 02:16:23,679
just doing steroids steroids is going to

4148
02:16:21,359 --> 02:16:24,399
increase all the other stuff that you do

4149
02:16:23,679 --> 02:16:26,000
so if you've

4150
02:16:24,399 --> 02:16:28,000
if you have good training you have good

4151
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:28,560
diet good quality of sleep like all this

4152
02:16:28,000 --> 02:16:31,279
other stuff

4153
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:32,800
then you can take advantage of that but

4154
02:16:31,279 --> 02:16:35,119
you could shoot steroids and nobody

4155
02:16:32,799 --> 02:16:36,558
would know

4156
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:38,399
and honestly you go down to 24-hour

4157
02:16:36,558 --> 02:16:41,039
fitness and you'll see a bunch of

4158
02:16:38,398 --> 02:16:42,638
you know late you know 19 to 21 year old

4159
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:44,719
kids that are all kind of red and

4160
02:16:42,638 --> 02:16:46,239
150 pounds that look like that don't

4161
02:16:44,718 --> 02:16:48,398
look like anything yeah

4162
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:49,280
and there a bunch of them will be using

4163
02:16:48,398 --> 02:16:53,119
steroids

4164
02:16:49,280 --> 02:16:54,719
because yeah they're not like so it's

4165
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:56,960
it's not the it's not going to make a

4166
02:16:54,718 --> 02:16:57,919
champion like you said it's not going to

4167
02:16:56,959 --> 02:16:59,518
at most

4168
02:16:57,920 --> 02:17:01,840
guess what i was already at an elite

4169
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:04,960
level i was one of the best in the world

4170
02:17:01,840 --> 02:17:05,840
before i started using it doesn't it

4171
02:17:04,959 --> 02:17:08,799
doesn't do that

4172
02:17:05,840 --> 02:17:10,318
it does a 10 increase at best yeah and

4173
02:17:08,799 --> 02:17:11,279
that's proven in the statistics which is

4174
02:17:10,318 --> 02:17:12,879
interesting because most people don't

4175
02:17:11,280 --> 02:17:16,800
know this like

4176
02:17:12,879 --> 02:17:20,159
it the data is right there yeah

4177
02:17:16,799 --> 02:17:21,039
yeah and that's why i i'm often saddened

4178
02:17:20,159 --> 02:17:25,039
by

4179
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:27,599
maybe um the negative

4180
02:17:25,040 --> 02:17:28,719
view of somebody like lance armstrong

4181
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:31,280
who's

4182
02:17:28,718 --> 02:17:33,039
one of the greatest athletes in history

4183
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:34,479
and everybody else that he was competing

4184
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:37,200
against i'm sorry

4185
02:17:34,478 --> 02:17:39,438
yeah i hate to blow anybody's bubble but

4186
02:17:37,200 --> 02:17:40,159
regardless if i told you my ethical uh

4187
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:41,040
pieces with

4188
02:17:40,159 --> 02:17:44,159
saying that you're going to be at

4189
02:17:41,040 --> 02:17:44,160
something at an elite level

4190
02:17:44,638 --> 02:17:48,879
you look at most a lot of those big

4191
02:17:46,718 --> 02:17:50,398
figures out there

4192
02:17:48,879 --> 02:17:52,398
when the their income and your life

4193
02:17:50,398 --> 02:17:53,439
relies on it yeah you're going to push

4194
02:17:52,398 --> 02:17:55,519
those limits so

4195
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:57,599
maybe maybe my ethical would change if

4196
02:17:55,519 --> 02:17:59,840
if if i was in that position too

4197
02:17:57,599 --> 02:18:00,880
because here's the thing what i believe

4198
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:03,760
like

4199
02:18:00,879 --> 02:18:05,279
someone is i think people should avoid

4200
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:08,800
steroids

4201
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:10,159
um trt probably something worth taking a

4202
02:18:08,799 --> 02:18:11,920
look at what your levels are when you're

4203
02:18:10,159 --> 02:18:13,599
in the 35 to 45 range

4204
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:14,879
and see what decision you decide to make

4205
02:18:13,599 --> 02:18:15,439
from there and that's a decision that

4206
02:18:14,879 --> 02:18:17,039
you make for

4207
02:18:15,439 --> 02:18:18,079
the rest of your life the only times

4208
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:18,960
that you should be taking a look at

4209
02:18:18,079 --> 02:18:22,079
steroids

4210
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:22,879
is if it's it's funding your life it's

4211
02:18:22,079 --> 02:18:25,200
creating

4212
02:18:22,879 --> 02:18:26,000
that it is your job and it's doing like

4213
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:29,439
and honestly

4214
02:18:26,000 --> 02:18:32,478
it was for me like i so

4215
02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:34,880
was it the only thing no no

4216
02:18:32,478 --> 02:18:36,079
if you want to get into neurology uh

4217
02:18:34,879 --> 02:18:37,839
neurotransmitters

4218
02:18:36,079 --> 02:18:39,760
and alcohol there's a really interesting

4219
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:41,679
discussion on performance enhancement um

4220
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:44,079
so when i lift heavy

4221
02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:45,519
um and so i always promote it like not

4222
02:18:44,079 --> 02:18:46,879
more than a drink or two like once or

4223
02:18:45,519 --> 02:18:48,000
twice a month is what all i'm talking

4224
02:18:46,879 --> 02:18:49,759
about when i'm

4225
02:18:48,000 --> 02:18:51,120
when i'm saying this so like what's the

4226
02:18:49,760 --> 02:18:53,280
timing of the drink over talking

4227
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:54,240
it's about three to five minutes before

4228
02:18:53,280 --> 02:18:56,800
yes

4229
02:18:54,239 --> 02:18:58,558
and we're talking about beer it doesn't

4230
02:18:56,799 --> 02:19:01,759
matter the uh the source

4231
02:18:58,558 --> 02:19:03,119
so um i shots are the easiest you want

4232
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:05,280
something that is not going to have some

4233
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:07,599
sort of regurgitatory effect or

4234
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:09,120
bloating effect or anything like that

4235
02:19:07,599 --> 02:19:10,079
but you want to have the quick hit of

4236
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:12,240
energy so it's a

4237
02:19:10,079 --> 02:19:13,359
preferential energy source moves above

4238
02:19:12,239 --> 02:19:15,679
ketones carbs

4239
02:19:13,359 --> 02:19:16,479
everything it's seven calories per gram

4240
02:19:15,679 --> 02:19:18,000
but then there's

4241
02:19:16,478 --> 02:19:19,760
some really interesting things that

4242
02:19:18,000 --> 02:19:21,519
happen spikes blood pressure which is

4243
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:23,359
going to make weights feel lighter

4244
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:25,519
so when you're in your early 20s and

4245
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:27,599
you're trying to hit up you know

4246
02:19:25,519 --> 02:19:29,040
some attractive person at the bar and

4247
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:30,639
you're with your buddies

4248
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:32,240
and you're like ah you know and you got

4249
02:19:30,638 --> 02:19:34,398
second guess oh should i

4250
02:19:32,239 --> 02:19:35,599
and they go have a shot of liquid

4251
02:19:34,398 --> 02:19:38,718
courage

4252
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:40,318
and you have one and all of a sudden the

4253
02:19:38,718 --> 02:19:42,239
the second thoughts the second guessing

4254
02:19:40,318 --> 02:19:43,760
all that drops away like you're focused

4255
02:19:42,239 --> 02:19:45,439
in the moment uh

4256
02:19:43,760 --> 02:19:46,719
and you walk over and you actually

4257
02:19:45,439 --> 02:19:47,920
perform a little better like

4258
02:19:46,718 --> 02:19:49,199
conversation wise than you normally

4259
02:19:47,920 --> 02:19:49,920
would now if you have five or six and

4260
02:19:49,200 --> 02:19:50,960
then go over

4261
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:52,719
you're gonna make a fool of yourself so

4262
02:19:50,959 --> 02:19:54,398
it's all about timing an amount but

4263
02:19:52,719 --> 02:19:56,398
there is a reason that that happens

4264
02:19:54,398 --> 02:19:57,840
so anyway i'm known for promoting this

4265
02:19:56,398 --> 02:20:00,159
whiskey and deadlift concept

4266
02:19:57,840 --> 02:20:01,680
um i love this but but it works like the

4267
02:20:00,159 --> 02:20:03,439
eastern block bloc

4268
02:20:01,680 --> 02:20:04,800
that's where that's where i stole it

4269
02:20:03,439 --> 02:20:07,200
from because i was watching

4270
02:20:04,799 --> 02:20:08,799
all these russian lifters would have a

4271
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:10,399
shot of vodka or something before they

4272
02:20:08,799 --> 02:20:11,119
go lyft and i'm like there's something

4273
02:20:10,398 --> 02:20:13,358
here

4274
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:15,359
so i started experimenting with it and

4275
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:16,800
i'm like that works and then i started

4276
02:20:15,359 --> 02:20:18,159
researching nobody talks about this

4277
02:20:16,799 --> 02:20:19,358
stuff so it takes a while to start

4278
02:20:18,159 --> 02:20:21,039
piecing together

4279
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:22,960
all the stuff that actually happens to

4280
02:20:21,040 --> 02:20:25,359
make that happen but

4281
02:20:22,959 --> 02:20:26,000
it moves away the things that you're

4282
02:20:25,359 --> 02:20:28,159
going to

4283
02:20:26,000 --> 02:20:30,239
the concerns about the ramifications in

4284
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:32,719
the future and the other stuff so the

4285
02:20:30,239 --> 02:20:33,439
um but brings you into the moment and

4286
02:20:32,719 --> 02:20:35,039
then the

4287
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:37,359
the dopamine hit in the other and then

4288
02:20:35,040 --> 02:20:39,680
it uh enhances whatever mood that you're

4289
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:42,960
in but all of a sudden you get

4290
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:46,079
in the state much

4291
02:20:42,959 --> 02:20:47,039
easier and so it's really really

4292
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:49,760
interesting but it's

4293
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:51,120
very it's a very small amount needed and

4294
02:20:49,760 --> 02:20:54,000
very time sensitive

4295
02:20:51,120 --> 02:20:55,680
but it can be so much more powerful than

4296
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:57,920
like drugs people use

4297
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:59,840
for this stuff it ties really together

4298
02:20:57,920 --> 02:21:00,398
with meditative state and other pieces

4299
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:03,280
to

4300
02:21:00,398 --> 02:21:04,639
to to get you into that flow state those

4301
02:21:03,280 --> 02:21:06,640
thoughts about

4302
02:21:04,639 --> 02:21:08,478
failure what if whatever like all that

4303
02:21:06,639 --> 02:21:11,519
you you get into

4304
02:21:08,478 --> 02:21:14,318
that zone that moment that time

4305
02:21:11,520 --> 02:21:15,760
um anyway so interesting and alcoholic

4306
02:21:14,318 --> 02:21:17,680
is promoting out you know

4307
02:21:15,760 --> 02:21:19,680
uh no but there's an important point

4308
02:21:17,680 --> 02:21:21,600
here it's not often talked about i think

4309
02:21:19,680 --> 02:21:23,280
it is fascinating that

4310
02:21:21,600 --> 02:21:26,079
because you can get into so much trouble

4311
02:21:23,280 --> 02:21:28,079
with alcohol when used in excess people

4312
02:21:26,079 --> 02:21:30,398
don't often talk about the

4313
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:31,280
the positive aspects of alcohol even in

4314
02:21:30,398 --> 02:21:34,719
your

4315
02:21:31,280 --> 02:21:36,800
college years it had

4316
02:21:34,719 --> 02:21:38,478
it had a lasting effect on who i am as a

4317
02:21:36,799 --> 02:21:40,239
person i don't think people can

4318
02:21:38,478 --> 02:21:41,840
give enough credit to the positive

4319
02:21:40,239 --> 02:21:43,039
aspect see

4320
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:44,239
you could have accomplished a lot of

4321
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:45,120
those same things with a little more

4322
02:21:44,239 --> 02:21:47,039
moderation

4323
02:21:45,120 --> 02:21:48,560
which i think people should talk about

4324
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:51,280
more which is like

4325
02:21:48,559 --> 02:21:53,600
the the way to open up a personality

4326
02:21:51,280 --> 02:21:54,640
like the flowering of the full character

4327
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:57,520
and the weirdness

4328
02:21:54,639 --> 02:21:58,959
and the the like the beauty of who you

4329
02:21:57,520 --> 02:21:59,920
are as a human being could be opened up

4330
02:21:58,959 --> 02:22:01,438
with alcohol

4331
02:21:59,920 --> 02:22:03,680
and that's really interesting to think

4332
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:06,239
about you should try some podcasts

4333
02:22:03,680 --> 02:22:09,040
with a with a shot and and these yeah

4334
02:22:06,239 --> 02:22:09,039
you know actually

4335
02:22:09,840 --> 02:22:13,920
with myself and guests and it will

4336
02:22:11,680 --> 02:22:16,479
change the conversation lubricates this

4337
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:18,079
the conversation definitely not the

4338
02:22:16,478 --> 02:22:20,159
excess and which is what i learned

4339
02:22:18,079 --> 02:22:21,760
because i went all the way in because i

4340
02:22:20,159 --> 02:22:23,840
do everything at extremes

4341
02:22:21,760 --> 02:22:26,880
yeah so it was a really hard lesson that

4342
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:29,760
took me a lot of time to unwind

4343
02:22:26,879 --> 02:22:31,199
but it is interesting and people don't

4344
02:22:29,760 --> 02:22:33,439
discuss those things because it's

4345
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:34,720
it's either this or this you're one of

4346
02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:38,079
the greatest strength

4347
02:22:34,719 --> 02:22:39,438
athletes of all time so it's worthwhile

4348
02:22:38,079 --> 02:22:42,159
to consider

4349
02:22:39,439 --> 02:22:43,439
how you optimize the the feast of

4350
02:22:42,159 --> 02:22:46,799
strength that you

4351
02:22:43,439 --> 02:22:49,280
reach for uh with things like steroids

4352
02:22:46,799 --> 02:22:50,318
it makes perfect sense and i think that

4353
02:22:49,280 --> 02:22:51,760
was a

4354
02:22:50,318 --> 02:22:53,119
from my perspective i think it was

4355
02:22:51,760 --> 02:22:54,639
probably the right decision you've

4356
02:22:53,120 --> 02:22:56,000
achieved something incredible that

4357
02:22:54,639 --> 02:22:58,959
inspires

4358
02:22:56,000 --> 02:23:01,520
a huge number of people that's it and

4359
02:22:58,959 --> 02:23:03,519
you've shown to yourself into the world

4360
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:04,560
but what the human body can accomplish

4361
02:23:03,520 --> 02:23:08,000
yep that's incredible

4362
02:23:04,559 --> 02:23:10,239
and no matter if i push to a less weight

4363
02:23:08,000 --> 02:23:12,318
and if i disclosed everything that i did

4364
02:23:10,239 --> 02:23:14,159
and i didn't when i wasn't using

4365
02:23:12,318 --> 02:23:15,760
steroids in my opinion if we went

4366
02:23:14,159 --> 02:23:16,478
through everything there would people

4367
02:23:15,760 --> 02:23:18,079
that would say

4368
02:23:16,478 --> 02:23:19,840
you're using performance enhancing yeah

4369
02:23:18,079 --> 02:23:21,200
no matter what like it is

4370
02:23:19,840 --> 02:23:22,639
it's straight up so you just need to be

4371
02:23:21,200 --> 02:23:23,439
okay with it yourself and so i had to

4372
02:23:22,639 --> 02:23:26,799
make the call

4373
02:23:23,439 --> 02:23:27,280
i want to see what the true potential is

4374
02:23:26,799 --> 02:23:28,959
of

4375
02:23:27,280 --> 02:23:31,680
ever let's throw everything out the

4376
02:23:28,959 --> 02:23:32,000
window that i feel unless i feel it's a

4377
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:33,600
risk

4378
02:23:32,000 --> 02:23:35,760
from a from a health standpoint that i'm

4379
02:23:33,600 --> 02:23:39,040
not willing to take on

4380
02:23:35,760 --> 02:23:40,960
and because that's how do i like

4381
02:23:39,040 --> 02:23:42,479
it's just picking and choosing yeah and

4382
02:23:40,959 --> 02:23:44,159
it's just picking and choosing i

4383
02:23:42,478 --> 02:23:46,079
here's what i want to know this is what

4384
02:23:44,159 --> 02:23:48,559
i want to be able to try to achieve

4385
02:23:46,079 --> 02:23:49,439
and so yeah yeah that's what i did and

4386
02:23:48,559 --> 02:23:51,680
and what you did

4387
02:23:49,439 --> 02:23:53,200
is incredible like it's it's just awe

4388
02:23:51,680 --> 02:23:56,079
inspiring and it was pretty

4389
02:23:53,200 --> 02:23:56,960
strong did was incredible yeah and uh

4390
02:23:56,079 --> 02:23:58,159
and that aced me up

4391
02:23:56,959 --> 02:23:59,759
and what's funny is the people that

4392
02:23:58,159 --> 02:24:01,760
basham are like on the media or

4393
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:04,800
politicians or maybe some actors

4394
02:24:01,760 --> 02:24:06,318
and guess what a ton of them are doing

4395
02:24:04,799 --> 02:24:08,398
the same thing

4396
02:24:06,318 --> 02:24:09,359
it's hypocrisy at its finest trust me

4397
02:24:08,398 --> 02:24:10,719
but how many

4398
02:24:09,359 --> 02:24:13,040
how many of those figures you're

4399
02:24:10,719 --> 02:24:15,119
watching in movies that love to talk

4400
02:24:13,040 --> 02:24:16,080
you know people you know be political

4401
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:18,720
and do this and

4402
02:24:16,079 --> 02:24:19,280
the news and all this i'm telling you

4403
02:24:18,719 --> 02:24:22,398
there

4404
02:24:19,280 --> 02:24:26,079
there's anti-aging clinics like all

4405
02:24:22,398 --> 02:24:27,519
over california and everywhere else

4406
02:24:26,079 --> 02:24:29,520
who do you think just keeps them in

4407
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:31,120
business well it's not the competitive

4408
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:32,560
lifter i'll tell you that

4409
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:34,399
well that's yes and they're using

4410
02:24:32,559 --> 02:24:37,840
peptides and also

4411
02:24:34,398 --> 02:24:39,840
in psalms and all sorts of like

4412
02:24:37,840 --> 02:24:41,120
you're speaking to the hypocrisy i also

4413
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:42,880
want to speak to the

4414
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:44,399
the fact you know somebody's a friend of

4415
02:24:42,879 --> 02:24:45,119
mine david goggins i don't know if you

4416
02:24:44,398 --> 02:24:48,318
know that is

4417
02:24:45,120 --> 02:24:49,840
ultra marathon runner um navy seal

4418
02:24:48,318 --> 02:24:51,359
he gets pretty incredible person yeah

4419
02:24:49,840 --> 02:24:52,960
incredible human being and he gets

4420
02:24:51,359 --> 02:24:56,000
criticism like

4421
02:24:52,959 --> 02:24:57,438
you know what you're doing is um is bad

4422
02:24:56,000 --> 02:25:00,639
for the body you know you're you're

4423
02:24:57,439 --> 02:25:00,639
pushing yourself too far

4424
02:25:00,719 --> 02:25:04,879
i find that the people that criticize

4425
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:07,520
are often people that

4426
02:25:04,879 --> 02:25:08,239
haven't truly pushed themselves to the

4427
02:25:07,520 --> 02:25:09,600
limit

4428
02:25:08,239 --> 02:25:11,680
they haven't actually worked hard in

4429
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:15,520
their life when you

4430
02:25:11,680 --> 02:25:16,960
work hard you realize how incredible it

4431
02:25:15,520 --> 02:25:20,239
is that a human being

4432
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:20,799
can dedicate themselves so fully to an

4433
02:25:20,239 --> 02:25:23,359
effort

4434
02:25:20,799 --> 02:25:24,478
the way you did the way david goggins

4435
02:25:23,359 --> 02:25:27,359
does

4436
02:25:24,478 --> 02:25:27,840
the way the way the greatest athletes do

4437
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:30,399
and

4438
02:25:27,840 --> 02:25:32,398
there's nothing that should be said

4439
02:25:30,398 --> 02:25:34,398
beyond just sitting back in awe

4440
02:25:32,398 --> 02:25:35,680
that humans can achieve that and that

4441
02:25:34,398 --> 02:25:38,000
inspires me

4442
02:25:35,680 --> 02:25:39,920
to do the best whatever the hell i do to

4443
02:25:38,000 --> 02:25:42,000
be the the best version of that

4444
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:43,600
there's something about like athletic

4445
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:46,959
feats especially like

4446
02:25:43,600 --> 02:25:50,159
strength that just en

4447
02:25:46,959 --> 02:25:51,919
inspire us to do the best uh to be the

4448
02:25:50,159 --> 02:25:52,318
best version of ourselves i don't know

4449
02:25:51,920 --> 02:25:53,840
and

4450
02:25:52,318 --> 02:25:55,439
that's the only thing you should be

4451
02:25:53,840 --> 02:25:58,960
saying as opposed to

4452
02:25:55,439 --> 02:26:00,398
uh criticizing some little detail of

4453
02:25:58,959 --> 02:26:03,119
this and that

4454
02:26:00,398 --> 02:26:05,279
it's just an awe inspiring that you push

4455
02:26:03,120 --> 02:26:06,800
yourself anybody that is at that level

4456
02:26:05,280 --> 02:26:08,560
and this is funny like in competitive

4457
02:26:06,799 --> 02:26:09,840
sports like you go online and people is

4458
02:26:08,559 --> 02:26:11,840
just bash bash bash

4459
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:13,200
bash back back you go talk to anybody

4460
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:15,439
anybody

4461
02:26:13,200 --> 02:26:16,720
anybody that's a high-level athlete

4462
02:26:15,439 --> 02:26:18,720
within that field

4463
02:26:16,719 --> 02:26:20,000
and nobody has a single bad thing to say

4464
02:26:18,719 --> 02:26:22,719
about each other

4465
02:26:20,000 --> 02:26:25,200
but all this chitter chatter down there

4466
02:26:22,719 --> 02:26:27,920
i mean i know exactly what you're saying

4467
02:26:25,200 --> 02:26:28,479
so if you i i would say because i have

4468
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:30,559
love for

4469
02:26:28,478 --> 02:26:33,679
all those folks especially when you're

4470
02:26:30,559 --> 02:26:36,719
younger you have a little bit of that

4471
02:26:33,680 --> 02:26:38,000
desire to criticize others like i think

4472
02:26:36,719 --> 02:26:40,639
that should be channeled

4473
02:26:38,000 --> 02:26:42,478
in improving your own life any time that

4474
02:26:40,639 --> 02:26:44,639
you feel that way

4475
02:26:42,478 --> 02:26:46,639
that is when you need to turn inward

4476
02:26:44,639 --> 02:26:49,680
yeah and it's hard to do

4477
02:26:46,639 --> 02:26:51,199
but there is a reason that you have

4478
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:53,120
those emotions

4479
02:26:51,200 --> 02:26:54,479
around someone else and what they're

4480
02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:56,000
doing that

4481
02:26:54,478 --> 02:26:58,159
you have an opportunity to look at

4482
02:26:56,000 --> 02:27:01,680
yourself and know why you

4483
02:26:58,159 --> 02:27:02,959
feel that way and that guess what that's

4484
02:27:01,680 --> 02:27:04,639
going to be the hard thing to do that's

4485
02:27:02,959 --> 02:27:05,839
going to be the thing again that's

4486
02:27:04,639 --> 02:27:08,398
stirring you a little bit because it's

4487
02:27:05,840 --> 02:27:10,478
so much easier to sit there

4488
02:27:08,398 --> 02:27:12,559
and uh or talk to your confidante or

4489
02:27:10,478 --> 02:27:14,879
whatever instead of go

4490
02:27:12,559 --> 02:27:16,719
why does that bother me yeah why does

4491
02:27:14,879 --> 02:27:18,478
what that person doing or what that

4492
02:27:16,719 --> 02:27:22,719
person's achieving

4493
02:27:18,478 --> 02:27:26,879
bother me it's like a difficult question

4494
02:27:22,719 --> 02:27:26,879
that i often ask others

4495
02:27:27,920 --> 02:27:31,120
whether it's better to work hard or work

4496
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:34,159
smart

4497
02:27:31,120 --> 02:27:36,800
i like to ask that question because it

4498
02:27:34,159 --> 02:27:39,200
helps me get a sense of the human being

4499
02:27:36,799 --> 02:27:42,959
and i think i

4500
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:42,960
let me just say like i often

4501
02:27:43,680 --> 02:27:48,398
i often like people that answer that

4502
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:48,399
would work hard

4503
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:53,439
even though the quote unquote right

4504
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:56,479
answers work smart

4505
02:27:53,439 --> 02:28:00,079
meaning like finding the optimal

4506
02:27:56,478 --> 02:28:02,079
efficient way to achieve a certain goal

4507
02:28:00,079 --> 02:28:03,359
i find that people that answer work

4508
02:28:02,079 --> 02:28:06,239
smart

4509
02:28:03,359 --> 02:28:08,479
don't actually find the optimal

4510
02:28:06,239 --> 02:28:10,559
efficient way to achieve a goal

4511
02:28:08,478 --> 02:28:12,799
it seems like the people that at least

4512
02:28:10,559 --> 02:28:15,680
certainly early in life

4513
02:28:12,799 --> 02:28:16,239
strive to work their ass off even that

4514
02:28:15,680 --> 02:28:18,720
means

4515
02:28:16,239 --> 02:28:20,159
doing the inefficient the dumb thing

4516
02:28:18,719 --> 02:28:22,959
just to learn

4517
02:28:20,159 --> 02:28:24,879
the mistake the spirit behind the human

4518
02:28:22,959 --> 02:28:28,000
spirit behind the person that says

4519
02:28:24,879 --> 02:28:28,639
or a card is is the one that i connect

4520
02:28:28,000 --> 02:28:30,478
with but i'm

4521
02:28:28,639 --> 02:28:32,239
i'm torn especially in the in the war

4522
02:28:30,478 --> 02:28:33,199
culture in the tech sector where people

4523
02:28:32,239 --> 02:28:37,039
answer work smart

4524
02:28:33,200 --> 02:28:38,000
what would you um what would you say

4525
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:41,040
about that technician

4526
02:28:38,000 --> 02:28:43,359
this definitely encompasses like

4527
02:28:41,040 --> 02:28:44,080
i i'm the intellectual and i'm the meat

4528
02:28:43,359 --> 02:28:47,760
head

4529
02:28:44,079 --> 02:28:50,000
i'm the work around the clock yeah and

4530
02:28:47,760 --> 02:28:51,120
go fix the processes and make it so much

4531
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:53,359
better

4532
02:28:51,120 --> 02:28:54,800
type person right that's that's that's

4533
02:28:53,359 --> 02:28:56,399
me and all that's everything that's my

4534
02:28:54,799 --> 02:28:58,239
life story right

4535
02:28:56,398 --> 02:28:59,439
busting your ass to find the easiest way

4536
02:28:58,239 --> 02:29:03,039
possible

4537
02:28:59,439 --> 02:29:07,280
to both so like

4538
02:29:03,040 --> 02:29:09,760
i will i will build

4539
02:29:07,280 --> 02:29:11,760
a custom hydraulic cart that will lift

4540
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:15,359
my plates up to the height of my

4541
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:16,639
my squat so that i can minimize they

4542
02:29:15,359 --> 02:29:18,640
roll it over next to it and then

4543
02:29:16,639 --> 02:29:18,959
minimize the effort of it going on and

4544
02:29:18,639 --> 02:29:21,519
off

4545
02:29:18,959 --> 02:29:23,839
yeah to be able to lift the most amount

4546
02:29:21,520 --> 02:29:26,640
of weight as possible

4547
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:27,680
yeah so so that i can save the energy

4548
02:29:26,639 --> 02:29:29,279
from here

4549
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:30,880
from lifting those up and the fatigue of

4550
02:29:29,280 --> 02:29:34,319
my back being in bad position

4551
02:29:30,879 --> 02:29:36,839
so i can nearly kill myself over here

4552
02:29:34,318 --> 02:29:38,559
yes right i

4553
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:40,239
[Laughter]

4554
02:29:38,559 --> 02:29:42,000
my wife anybody will say i'm a

4555
02:29:40,239 --> 02:29:43,680
workaholic yeah

4556
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:45,439
and the the first thing that i would do

4557
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:47,439
when it would be uh doing

4558
02:29:45,439 --> 02:29:48,720
a company a company turnaround they'd

4559
02:29:47,439 --> 02:29:50,398
hire me come in

4560
02:29:48,719 --> 02:29:52,000
and i would be taking over for someone

4561
02:29:50,398 --> 02:29:54,239
that wasn't successful

4562
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:55,439
but it was usually hardly ever for lack

4563
02:29:54,239 --> 02:29:56,959
of want or trying

4564
02:29:55,439 --> 02:29:58,159
so a lot of times they knew they were

4565
02:29:56,959 --> 02:29:58,879
unsuccessful and they were running

4566
02:29:58,159 --> 02:30:01,439
around

4567
02:29:58,879 --> 02:30:02,318
working six seven days a week 12 hour

4568
02:30:01,439 --> 02:30:04,720
days

4569
02:30:02,318 --> 02:30:06,478
doing so much and be like well you need

4570
02:30:04,719 --> 02:30:08,318
to do this and they train me on like

4571
02:30:06,478 --> 02:30:10,959
all the reports and this and all the

4572
02:30:08,318 --> 02:30:13,199
things and like good luck

4573
02:30:10,959 --> 02:30:14,318
good luck i couldn't do it and the first

4574
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:17,040
thing i would do

4575
02:30:14,318 --> 02:30:17,039
is nothing

4576
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:20,960
i would do nothing

4577
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:28,399
because then i would find what actually

4578
02:30:25,040 --> 02:30:30,319
keeps coming back the things that i need

4579
02:30:28,398 --> 02:30:31,519
to do and how much of it was filling the

4580
02:30:30,318 --> 02:30:34,000
space

4581
02:30:31,520 --> 02:30:35,840
because so much of human nature when

4582
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:37,760
you're failing

4583
02:30:35,840 --> 02:30:39,520
is to make yourself feel like you're

4584
02:30:37,760 --> 02:30:41,200
accomplishing things this is when things

4585
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:43,520
go on your list

4586
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:44,399
on your checklist and you start like

4587
02:30:43,520 --> 02:30:46,720
rolling up so

4588
02:30:44,398 --> 02:30:48,639
are you running around just getting [ __ ]

4589
02:30:46,719 --> 02:30:52,000
done yeah yeah being busy

4590
02:30:48,639 --> 02:30:54,799
right and so yeah so

4591
02:30:52,000 --> 02:30:57,040
but at the same time like find somewhere

4592
02:30:54,799 --> 02:30:59,279
in my career something i've done

4593
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,800
where i haven't outworked everybody just

4594
02:30:59,280 --> 02:31:05,280
so much on distilling

4595
02:31:00,799 --> 02:31:08,559
things down to what's important yeah and

4596
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:11,840
you've got to make time to

4597
02:31:08,559 --> 02:31:14,879
sit back and assess and

4598
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:16,799
think and be introspective you have to

4599
02:31:14,879 --> 02:31:19,358
make time for this

4600
02:31:16,799 --> 02:31:21,519
because if not you're going to waste so

4601
02:31:19,359 --> 02:31:24,960
much time sitting there

4602
02:31:21,520 --> 02:31:27,439
walking sideways when

4603
02:31:24,959 --> 02:31:29,358
all you got to do is move just one step

4604
02:31:27,439 --> 02:31:33,040
in front of the other each day just one

4605
02:31:29,359 --> 02:31:35,439
that's all i say because

4606
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:36,640
it's gonna add up but you could spend

4607
02:31:35,439 --> 02:31:39,120
six months

4608
02:31:36,639 --> 02:31:40,159
knocking [ __ ] out doing your routine

4609
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:44,319
busting your ass

4610
02:31:40,159 --> 02:31:46,799
and not take that one step

4611
02:31:44,318 --> 02:31:48,318
so you've got to distill stuff down

4612
02:31:46,799 --> 02:31:50,239
you've got to really understand

4613
02:31:48,318 --> 02:31:52,879
like what's important to you in life and

4614
02:31:50,239 --> 02:31:54,478
where you're going and

4615
02:31:52,879 --> 02:31:56,079
when you're looking at anything in your

4616
02:31:54,478 --> 02:31:59,599
life the first thing that you need to do

4617
02:31:56,079 --> 02:32:00,000
is figure out do i need to do it and

4618
02:31:59,600 --> 02:32:02,800
just

4619
02:32:00,000 --> 02:32:04,239
quit doing it just quit doing things in

4620
02:32:02,799 --> 02:32:06,799
your life

4621
02:32:04,239 --> 02:32:08,398
and you'll see that a lot of stuff that

4622
02:32:06,799 --> 02:32:11,679
you think has to be done

4623
02:32:08,398 --> 02:32:13,760
doesn't have to be done you'd be

4624
02:32:11,680 --> 02:32:14,960
surprised

4625
02:32:13,760 --> 02:32:17,760
and then from there this is the tech

4626
02:32:14,959 --> 02:32:20,799
okay then of that what can i

4627
02:32:17,760 --> 02:32:23,280
what can i automate what can i

4628
02:32:20,799 --> 02:32:24,000
not have to do in a repeated fashion and

4629
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:26,079
then

4630
02:32:24,000 --> 02:32:27,760
the last one yeah wherever possible if

4631
02:32:26,079 --> 02:32:29,520
it's not something that i'm adding

4632
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:31,520
tremendous value to

4633
02:32:29,520 --> 02:32:32,880
like my uniqueness people like oh you

4634
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:34,399
must like do the auto work on your

4635
02:32:32,879 --> 02:32:36,639
vehicles because you love working like

4636
02:32:34,398 --> 02:32:38,239
[ __ ] that i don't they're like what that

4637
02:32:36,639 --> 02:32:41,519
doesn't make any sense you and i'm like

4638
02:32:38,239 --> 02:32:42,398
no i love creating things yeah but i

4639
02:32:41,520 --> 02:32:45,920
don't want to do

4640
02:32:42,398 --> 02:32:47,199
that stuff so you could use delegating

4641
02:32:45,920 --> 02:32:49,200
if you're a manager position but it's

4642
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:52,159
outsourcing whatev what

4643
02:32:49,200 --> 02:32:52,880
uh whatever it is but there are also so

4644
02:32:52,159 --> 02:32:54,559
many things

4645
02:32:52,879 --> 02:32:56,799
this and this this ties back to your

4646
02:32:54,559 --> 02:32:59,760
point uh around

4647
02:32:56,799 --> 02:33:00,639
just doing it there's a point to like

4648
02:32:59,760 --> 02:33:02,960
experiencing

4649
02:33:00,639 --> 02:33:04,159
all levels to really understand things

4650
02:33:02,959 --> 02:33:06,959
you need

4651
02:33:04,159 --> 02:33:08,639
to spend time at the same time doing all

4652
02:33:06,959 --> 02:33:11,679
those things because there could be good

4653
02:33:08,639 --> 02:33:12,879
huge massive gaps in there that you're

4654
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:15,359
not aware of

4655
02:33:12,879 --> 02:33:17,199
that are key for you or key to be having

4656
02:33:15,359 --> 02:33:20,479
done different or so on

4657
02:33:17,200 --> 02:33:22,640
so um like in my company days

4658
02:33:20,478 --> 02:33:23,679
i was one of the few executives that

4659
02:33:22,639 --> 02:33:26,398
came in

4660
02:33:23,680 --> 02:33:27,040
that could do anything on the floor from

4661
02:33:26,398 --> 02:33:30,239
code

4662
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:34,479
to machine run a lathe a mill weld

4663
02:33:30,239 --> 02:33:36,959
do all step into engineering like

4664
02:33:34,478 --> 02:33:39,279
and and that added tremendous value to

4665
02:33:36,959 --> 02:33:42,239
me to having had spent time

4666
02:33:39,280 --> 02:33:43,280
being a doer and not enough people want

4667
02:33:42,239 --> 02:33:45,680
to be

4668
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:47,359
you've got to just go do [ __ ] yeah you

4669
02:33:45,680 --> 02:33:47,760
need to spend time in your life chopping

4670
02:33:47,359 --> 02:33:49,600
wood

4671
02:33:47,760 --> 02:33:51,040
yeah get a lot of [ __ ] doesn't matter

4672
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:53,840
you gotta have experience

4673
02:33:51,040 --> 02:33:55,200
trying and doing and doing all these

4674
02:33:53,840 --> 02:33:58,239
things that you would never

4675
02:33:55,200 --> 02:34:00,640
like my skill set is massive because

4676
02:33:58,239 --> 02:34:01,760
i want to know like you need to have

4677
02:34:00,639 --> 02:34:07,199
those touch points

4678
02:34:01,760 --> 02:34:07,200
my job my title is chief visionary

4679
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:14,318
but i've spent time doing everything

4680
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:16,398
it's not about just like creating this

4681
02:34:14,318 --> 02:34:17,840
amazing strategy or vision and i'm just

4682
02:34:16,398 --> 02:34:20,000
going to be there and this person that

4683
02:34:17,840 --> 02:34:21,680
directs and like like

4684
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:24,318
you can't be effective you cannot

4685
02:34:21,680 --> 02:34:26,398
connect the dots

4686
02:34:24,318 --> 02:34:27,760
unless you've been in the moment with

4687
02:34:26,398 --> 02:34:30,000
everything yeah

4688
02:34:27,760 --> 02:34:31,800
low-level stuff sometimes it's doing

4689
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:34,639
stupid [ __ ] that you're not

4690
02:34:31,799 --> 02:34:36,239
uniquely qualified to do that anybody

4691
02:34:34,639 --> 02:34:38,478
could do but you did it anyway

4692
02:34:36,239 --> 02:34:39,439
just the training environment people hit

4693
02:34:38,478 --> 02:34:41,840

be an online coach i'm like

4703
02:34:58,318 --> 02:35:05,439
you need to go spend a few years

4704
02:35:02,318 --> 02:35:07,840
one-on-one training people yeah to learn

4705
02:35:05,439 --> 02:35:09,520
like the interaction how people there's

4706
02:35:07,840 --> 02:35:12,239
base levels you have to do

4707
02:35:09,520 --> 02:35:13,040
you've got to go work your way up from

4708
02:35:12,239 --> 02:35:15,760
the ground

4709
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:17,680
yeah i truly believe it well i think

4710
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:19,200
that's the hard work piece that i'm

4711
02:35:17,680 --> 02:35:21,200
speaking to

4712
02:35:19,200 --> 02:35:24,800
that i like it when people have been

4713
02:35:21,200 --> 02:35:26,960
humbled by the hardness of life

4714
02:35:24,799 --> 02:35:27,920
like how difficult it is to do stuff and

4715
02:35:26,959 --> 02:35:30,079
it does to me

4716
02:35:27,920 --> 02:35:32,079
i went and got my mba i went to mit i

4717
02:35:30,079 --> 02:35:32,478
don't need to do that stuff i'm above

4718
02:35:32,079 --> 02:35:35,200
that

4719
02:35:32,478 --> 02:35:37,438
yeah yeah that that's once you've been

4720
02:35:35,200 --> 02:35:40,479
humble by doing those things i feel

4721
02:35:37,439 --> 02:35:42,720
like you can truly explore

4722
02:35:40,478 --> 02:35:44,079
the the optimization that you're talking

4723
02:35:42,719 --> 02:35:45,438
to finding the ways where you're

4724
02:35:44,079 --> 02:35:48,559
uniquely

4725
02:35:45,439 --> 02:35:49,120
capable to add value to the world and

4726
02:35:48,559 --> 02:35:51,840
then

4727
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:53,600
and then again work your ass off to be

4728
02:35:51,840 --> 02:35:55,760
the best in the world at that thing

4729
02:35:53,600 --> 02:35:56,640
yes uh so it's always then don't waste

4730
02:35:55,760 --> 02:35:58,559
your time on don't

4731
02:35:56,639 --> 02:36:00,398
[ __ ] that's not a line yeah that's the

4732
02:35:58,559 --> 02:36:02,000
only so that's i guess there's a lot of

4733
02:36:00,398 --> 02:36:04,959
context i put around that

4734
02:36:02,000 --> 02:36:06,000
um but yeah that was like a long answer

4735
02:36:04,959 --> 02:36:08,719
to uh

4736
02:36:06,000 --> 02:36:10,799
a long beautiful answer to a

4737
02:36:08,719 --> 02:36:12,559
unanswerable question

4738
02:36:10,799 --> 02:36:14,799
do you have advice outside of all this

4739
02:36:12,559 --> 02:36:15,920
discussion to young people today about

4740
02:36:14,799 --> 02:36:18,318
career about life

4741
02:36:15,920 --> 02:36:20,478
since you've done so many things you've

4742
02:36:18,318 --> 02:36:22,639
overcome a lot of things

4743
02:36:20,478 --> 02:36:24,799
i think high school college student

4744
02:36:22,639 --> 02:36:26,478
thinking about what to do in their life

4745
02:36:24,799 --> 02:36:28,079
do you have advice for those guys and

4746
02:36:26,478 --> 02:36:31,519
girls

4747
02:36:28,079 --> 02:36:33,520
yeah yeah first is

4748
02:36:31,520 --> 02:36:34,880
you don't have it figured out so don't

4749
02:36:33,520 --> 02:36:38,079
worry just jump in

4750
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:38,719
yeah um we talked uh you know a lot

4751
02:36:38,079 --> 02:36:40,639
about

4752
02:36:38,719 --> 02:36:43,358
understanding your values and aligning

4753
02:36:40,639 --> 02:36:44,959
all that stuff but

4754
02:36:43,359 --> 02:36:46,479
you got to have a base level of start

4755
02:36:44,959 --> 02:36:50,639
exploring and learning

4756
02:36:46,478 --> 02:36:54,318
and uh just spending the time doing like

4757
02:36:50,639 --> 02:36:55,760
pick something let me elaborate a little

4758
02:36:54,318 --> 02:36:57,279
bit no you know what a lot of people

4759
02:36:55,760 --> 02:36:58,960
struggle with that aspect now because

4760
02:36:57,280 --> 02:37:00,399
the choice there's so much choice

4761
02:36:58,959 --> 02:37:02,398
it's difficult to pick something but i

4762
02:37:00,398 --> 02:37:04,000
think it does boil down to you should

4763
02:37:02,398 --> 02:37:05,760
pick something and don't worry about it

4764
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:08,639
and then but within that

4765
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:10,239
you can start discovering the things

4766
02:37:08,639 --> 02:37:12,799
that are there for you

4767
02:37:10,239 --> 02:37:15,920
like i i talked about i made this huge

4768
02:37:12,799 --> 02:37:19,358
shift i threw away a whole life

4769
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:21,359
but i don't regret anything about that

4770
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:23,120
i wouldn't be where i was if i didn't

4771
02:37:21,359 --> 02:37:23,840
walk through and learn those things and

4772
02:37:23,120 --> 02:37:26,560
in fact

4773
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:27,920
in the course of that i learned just how

4774
02:37:26,559 --> 02:37:31,760
much

4775
02:37:27,920 --> 02:37:34,159
that inspiring people and helping them

4776
02:37:31,760 --> 02:37:35,920
realize the potential far beyond what

4777
02:37:34,159 --> 02:37:38,959
they thought was capable and guess what

4778
02:37:35,920 --> 02:37:41,200
that was leadership 101 in

4779
02:37:38,959 --> 02:37:42,159
managing people base level floor level

4780
02:37:41,200 --> 02:37:44,640
right

4781
02:37:42,159 --> 02:37:45,840
and i got a lot out it was perfectly

4782
02:37:44,639 --> 02:37:47,519
aligned with what and that's what i

4783
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:50,880
realized it didn't matter

4784
02:37:47,520 --> 02:37:52,960
um what industry i was in or any of

4785
02:37:50,879 --> 02:37:55,279
those other things

4786
02:37:52,959 --> 02:37:57,039
but i was able you can see so many

4787
02:37:55,280 --> 02:37:58,960
things there's so many paths that you

4788
02:37:57,040 --> 02:38:01,359
can go down to help you

4789
02:37:58,959 --> 02:38:02,398
realize what those things are and you're

4790
02:38:01,359 --> 02:38:06,159
going to be able to find

4791
02:38:02,398 --> 02:38:10,000
a lot of those nuggets and develop those

4792
02:38:06,159 --> 02:38:13,280
do you think that i could have just

4793
02:38:10,000 --> 02:38:15,520
gone to school and got out and

4794
02:38:13,280 --> 02:38:16,880
started a globally recognized brand

4795
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:20,640
within a few years

4796
02:38:16,879 --> 02:38:23,920
without having been schooled in business

4797
02:38:20,639 --> 02:38:26,799
while getting paid for it by others

4798
02:38:23,920 --> 02:38:28,398
for years and in fact that entire time i

4799
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:30,159
knew that that's what i wanted to do but

4800
02:38:28,398 --> 02:38:32,159
i didn't go out on it

4801
02:38:30,159 --> 02:38:33,520
i mentored some of my friends along the

4802
02:38:32,159 --> 02:38:35,359
same path

4803
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:37,280
to go no they're like i'm ready i'm

4804
02:38:35,359 --> 02:38:39,520
ready to go do this and i'm like no

4805
02:38:37,280 --> 02:38:41,280
now you need to go get a job you yeah

4806
02:38:39,520 --> 02:38:42,000
you know engineering management design

4807
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:44,000
all that stuff

4808
02:38:42,000 --> 02:38:45,680
go get a job as a as a manager now like

4809
02:38:44,000 --> 02:38:46,559
oh that's a step down i can't do that

4810
02:38:45,680 --> 02:38:48,000
i'm like go try it

4811
02:38:46,559 --> 02:38:49,760
a couple years ago oh my god that was

4812
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:50,478
such a good move i didn't know what i

4813
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:52,239
didn't know

4814
02:38:50,478 --> 02:38:54,398
and now they're an executive for

4815
02:38:52,239 --> 02:38:56,478
freaking a fortune 500 company

4816
02:38:54,398 --> 02:38:58,478
and the same thing like i sat there

4817
02:38:56,478 --> 02:39:00,000
knowing that i was getting a free

4818
02:38:58,478 --> 02:39:02,000
education

4819
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:03,439
don't stress yourself out as my that's

4820
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,959
my advice

4821
02:39:03,439 --> 02:39:07,200
don't stress yourself out that you've

4822
02:39:04,959 --> 02:39:09,199
got to have this perfect thing

4823
02:39:07,200 --> 02:39:10,560
because this process of understanding

4824
02:39:09,200 --> 02:39:12,479
your values and the interest but that

4825
02:39:10,559 --> 02:39:14,478
takes time

4826
02:39:12,478 --> 02:39:15,760
you can get a job where you're getting

4827
02:39:14,478 --> 02:39:18,639
paid to learn

4828
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:21,040
exactly that's a good deal before you

4829
02:39:18,639 --> 02:39:24,000
launch on your own

4830
02:39:21,040 --> 02:39:24,640
you mentioned um going back to darkness

4831
02:39:24,000 --> 02:39:27,600
i'm russian

4832
02:39:24,639 --> 02:39:28,959
so like going back to darkness you

4833
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:32,000
suffered from depression

4834
02:39:28,959 --> 02:39:33,599
you considered suicide do you ponder

4835
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:35,200
your own death these days

4836
02:39:33,600 --> 02:39:37,520
do you think about your mortality are

4837
02:39:35,200 --> 02:39:40,880
you afraid of death

4838
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:44,720
i definitely think about mortality

4839
02:39:40,879 --> 02:39:48,000
and am i afraid of my own death

4840
02:39:44,719 --> 02:39:49,438
it depends on the moment if i'm in the

4841
02:39:48,000 --> 02:39:52,559
middle of a project i definitely want to

4842
02:39:49,439 --> 02:39:56,159
finish that project man

4843
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:59,840
but i don't

4844
02:39:56,159 --> 02:40:03,359
fear it so much i fear

4845
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:07,680
leaving my kids

4846
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:08,318
or my wife um and not being able to be

4847
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:12,639
there

4848
02:40:08,318 --> 02:40:16,000
for them that bothers me outside of that

4849
02:40:12,639 --> 02:40:19,599
i know that i put everything into

4850
02:40:16,000 --> 02:40:21,520
what i at the life that i've lived

4851
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:24,159
like he said there's always more but

4852
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:28,000
like i've lived hard

4853
02:40:24,159 --> 02:40:28,000
i've loved hard yeah i've

4854
02:40:28,079 --> 02:40:33,359
every moment in my life i've made

4855
02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:35,040
connections and impacted people around

4856
02:40:33,359 --> 02:40:37,120
me

4857
02:40:35,040 --> 02:40:38,479
for the better and this tracks back

4858
02:40:37,120 --> 02:40:39,520
which is crazy when we're doing the

4859
02:40:38,478 --> 02:40:40,719
documentary

4860
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:42,720
and they're interviewing people through

4861
02:40:40,719 --> 02:40:44,559
my whole life and the consistency of the

4862
02:40:42,719 --> 02:40:47,599
