00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,120
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,839
vitalik buterin

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,440
his second time on the podcast vitalik

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,599
is the co-founder of ethereum

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,880
and one of the most influential people

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,519
in cryptocurrency

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,280
and technology broadly defined quick

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,480
mention of our sponsors

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,519
sigmatic

11
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,080
and better help check them out in the

12
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:26,879
description to support this podcast

13
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,679
as a side note let me say that ethereum

14
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:29,599
bitcoin

15
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:32,000
and many other cryptocurrencies have

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,479
been taking a wild ride of prices going

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,439
up

18
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,799
and down in the past few months to me

19
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:39,759
the prices were never

20
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:41,039
as important as the ideas both technical

21
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,799
and philosophical

22
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,079
cryptocurrency has the potential to

23
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:46,558
empower billions of people

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,840
to participate in the global economy in

25
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:50,640
a way that resists

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,120
the manipulation by centralized power

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,198
also

28
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,599
with smart contracts layer 2

29
00:00:53,198 --> 00:00:58,079
technologies data pools nfts

30
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,920
and of course integration of artificial

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
intelligence into the whole thing

32
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,120
we have the opportunity to build tools

33
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,438
and worlds

34
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,640
that transform physical and digital life

35
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:08,798
as we know it

36
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
hopefully minimizing the suffering in

37
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,720
the world

38
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,600
and maximizing the fun this

39
00:01:12,719 --> 00:01:16,719
is the lex friedman podcast and here is

40
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,158
my conversation

41
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,719
with vitalik buterin let's first talk

42
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,320
about

43
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,359
shiba ino if we can also known as sheba

44
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,118
token

45
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:31,519
code shib for contact shiba unu was

46
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,400
created in august 2020

47
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,959
modeled off of doshcoin by the anonymous

48
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,719
founder

49
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:42,158
known as ryoshi on may 10th

50
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:45,280
this year it had a market capitalization

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,359
of over 13 billion

52
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,320
and uh maybe you can explain this but in

53
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:51,519
a crazy move

54
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:54,719
you were given half of shibs uh

55
00:01:51,519 --> 00:01:57,920
total supply you

56
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:01,920
uh burned aka destroyed 90

57
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:05,359
of it that's worth 6.7

58
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:08,959
billion dollars and you donated 10

59
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:11,759
that's worth 1.2 billion

60
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,439
at the time to an uh india covet 19

61
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:15,840
relief fund

62
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:17,759
saying you don't want to be the locus of

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,800
this much power

64
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:23,598
this is uh fascinating

65
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,719
why and how were you able to walk away

66
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,679
from this much money

67
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,639
and this much power so i i should

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,680
probably start by

69
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,759
yeah giving some of the backstory around

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,120
you know these coins and this concept of

71
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:37,199
giving me coins

72
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,400
uh so you know first of all you know

73
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,560
shiba inu as you said

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,640
is this kind of knockoff of dogecoin

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,640
right and deutsche coin was this

76
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,279
initial kind of fun coin that was

77
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:49,518
created back i think around 2014 or so

78
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,360
and it was just created by jackson

79
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,039
palmer and like put it out as a joke for

80
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,920
a couple of hours and a community formed

81
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,560
around it

82
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:58,399
and at the beginning people didn't take

83
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,239
it very seriously i actually remember

84
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,480
putting about 25 000

85
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:03,439
into doge sometime around 2016 and i

86
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:06,479
just remember

87
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:08,719
uh just thinking to myself like okay how

88
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:11,679
am i going to explain my to my mom

89
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:12,239
that i just invested 25 000 into dog

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,080
coins

91
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,920
and like what even are dog coins like

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,800
the only interesting thing about this

93
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,679
coin is that there's

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,040
you know a logo of a dog somewhere um

95
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,480
but you know of course that ended up

96
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:23,039
being one of the best investments i've

97
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,199
ever made

98
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,199
and it did really well and then at the

99
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:28,798
end of 2020

100
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:30,318
elon musk of course you know started

101
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,879
talking about dogecoin

102
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,158
and the market cap just like shot up to

103
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:36,560
about 50

104
00:03:34,158 --> 00:03:38,318
billion dollars actually and it shot up

105
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,519
multiple times right like the first time

106
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,639
it went up from about

107
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,080
0.8 cents to about like seven cents

108
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,158
and this just happened all in one day

109
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,799
and i remember um this was when

110
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:49,598
i was still in singapore in the middle

111
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,280
of uh

112
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:55,039
kovid and you know i saw that the price

113
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,598
just went up by a thousand percent

114
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,039
and i was like oh my god my doge is

115
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:02,079
worth like a lot

116
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:04,000
and so i immediately called up some of

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,840
my friends and told them to like

118
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,598
drop everything in scramble and i just

119
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,680
sold half the dosh and

120
00:04:07,598 --> 00:04:11,359
i got 4.3 million dollars donated the

121
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,599
proceeds to give directly

122
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,360
and a few hours after i did this the

123
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:16,879
price dropped back down from about seven

124
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,239
cents to four cents right so i managed

125
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:19,519
to sell the doge at the top and i

126
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,679
remember just uh

127
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,120
feeling like i was such an amazing

128
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,400
trader but then of course

129
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,959
you know the price went up from four

130
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:30,719
cents then to seven and then 50 and just

131
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:32,239
like doge becoming this big phenomenon

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,440
where there's even a lot of people that

133
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,199
have heard of those that have not heard

134
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:37,120
of ethereum is just like something

135
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,560
even i wasn't predicting right and so

136
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,519
after that of course you know we have

137
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,360
doge and then

138
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:43,039
people are thinking well you know if the

139
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,319
leading dog token is worth 50 billion

140
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,360
dollars then surely

141
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:49,120
the second largest dog token deserves

142
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,520
you know at least seven or eight billion

143
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,280
right

144
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,560
because i feel like that's the kind of

145
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,599
what the mindset of these

146
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,199
shiba people is um so that of course

147
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,960
they did this other gimmick right where

148
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,680
they gave me half the shiba

149
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:04,000
token supply um they were actually not

150
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,800
the first projects to do this uh so

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,639
around the end of 2020 there was this

152
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,960
weird project called teller

153
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,560
it's like t-e-l-l-o-r i think they're a

154
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:13,198
chain-link competitor or something like

155
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,839
this

156
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,360
but i remember they just like dumped

157
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:18,638
fifty thousand dollars worth of their

158
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,080
token into my wallet

159
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,000
and then they had their twitter arbi

160
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:23,680
just like basically run around saying

161
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
look look at vitalik's wallet vitalik

162
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,240
holds

163
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,079
towers he's one of us he's a supporter

164
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,879
and as soon as i discovered this i just

165
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,959
like

166
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,159
publicly sold the tower tokens on you to

167
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,399
swap and

168
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,720
this created a bit of a twitter splat

169
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,319
now the shiva people were more clever

170
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,160
the shiva people instead of dumping to

171
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:40,719
that wallet they dumped to my cold

172
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,360
wallet

173
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,639
right so in a cryptocurrency right

174
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
there's this concept of like cold

175
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,199
wallets and hot wallets basically

176
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:50,478
like the thing that actually owns euro

177
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,400
money is like this

178
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,000
80 digit number called a private key

179
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,079
right and a hot wallet is when that

180
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,918
private key is just stored in memory on

181
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:00,560
your computer on your phone really easy

182
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:03,120
to access cold wallet means it's either

183
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,000
on written down on a piece of paper or

184
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,319
it's uh

185
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,759
on a computer that's just never accessed

186
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,879
the internet right so cold is very

187
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,560
inconvenient but

188
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,639
cold is also much more secure right

189
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,360
because even if that computer has some

190
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:16,800
like viruses on it like it's it's like

191
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,840
air gap that's not actually going to be

192
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,960
able to upload it

193
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:22,478
so this cold wallet and like all the

194
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,239
money's out of the cold wallet so it's

195
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,120
safe for me to talk about my setup now

196
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,918
right but it was

197
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,280
a laptop that was sitting in canada and

198
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,599
i also had

199
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,198
um two pieces of paper where i wrote

200
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,680
down two numbers on those two pieces of

201
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,960
paper one was with me one was in canada

202
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,720
and if you add those two numbers

203
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:41,279
together you get the private key

204
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,039
so because of covid travel restrictions

205
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,799
and you know this is in this

206
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,719
cold wallets in canada like it's very

207
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,879
difficult for me to

208
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,479
actually access it right and i'm not

209
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,639
sure if they knew this maybe they just

210
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:55,038
got lucky but basically they

211
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,840
you know sent a lot of uh these dog

212
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,959
tokens

213
00:06:55,839 --> 00:07:00,959
into this wallet where i it was very

214
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:01,839
difficult for me to access it but then i

215
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:03,359
saw these dot co

216
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:04,560
tokens i saw more and more people

217
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,000
talking about them and then at some

218
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,680
point i realized i

219
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,199
realized that like hey these things are

220
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,360
worth billions of dollars

221
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,400
and like you know there's lots of really

222
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,240
good things that you could do with that

223
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,359
amount of money and it would actually be

224
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,439
a waste to just like see it go so i made

225
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,639
the decision that like i would actually

226
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:23,038
power through and

227
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,639
figure out how to like safely like

228
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,199
basically get my private key

229
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,560
um i actually had to call up my family

230
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,639
tell them to read out

231
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,000
their number off of their piece of paper

232
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,478
i uh

233
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,759
entered that into a fresh laptop that i

234
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,240
bought from target then i

235
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,000
put in my other number on my piece of

236
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,598
paper added the two numbers together on

237
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,478
the computer there's the key

238
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:45,519
and at the same time like just scrambled

239
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:47,120
for two days

240
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,639
setting up a new wallet for to where i

241
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,319
could move my youth to safely

242
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,680
like getting people to be multi-sig

243
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,879
partners just like doing

244
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,319
all sorts of like stuff that you know 10

245
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,360
years ago you would expect to just be

246
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,800
part of a cyberpunk

247
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,319
you know science fiction novel but you

248
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,800
know now it's all real so you're doing

249
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,598
this

250
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,560
all by yourself i essentially most of it

251
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,319
by myself so

252
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
you have to keep it secret right and i

253
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,720
needed my family to

254
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,160
um actually like go and read the the

255
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,599
number on their piece of paper

256
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,479
and then i am in my new multisig wallet

257
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,360
like there's

258
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:19,839
other people that are signatories um but

259
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,199
you know

260
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,038
i'm obviously not going to reveal any

261
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,360
details beyond that about

262
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:26,318
so i did this right and i actually

263
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,800
managed to

264
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,400
make get the private key make the first

265
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,080
transaction that would just move all my

266
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:32,639
ether to the multisig wallet so it's

267
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
safe

268
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:37,199
and then second transact put the private

269
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,200
key on my main computer then started

270
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,640
you know like going in and just selling

271
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,919
some of the dark tokens and then just

272
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:44,559
like giving them to these

273
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:46,000
different charities now at the time i

274
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:49,278
actually

275
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,480
did not even like have any idea of how

276
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,200
much you would be able to get right

277
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,120
because like

278
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
on paper the dog tokens are seven

279
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,320
billion dollars but like in reality it's

280
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,480
a very liquid market you know

281
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
are you going to crash it by yeah and

282
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,839
after you sell 1 million worth you're

283
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,240
going to crash it after 10 million

284
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,440
are you might you actually be able to

285
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,720
get like an entire

286
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:12,720
200 million i had no idea um

287
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,480
so i definitely was just of the mindset

288
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,399
like okay i mean i'll sell a bit

289
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
maybe i get some eth and then you know

290
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,679
donated some yeast to give well donated

291
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,360
some to other groups and then

292
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,199
okay have some dog tokens like i don't

293
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,240
have an easy ability to sell more myself

294
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,080
but then i'll just

295
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,519
like give them to these groups and like

296
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,560
you know hopefully they'll do good

297
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,120
things with them

298
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:31,919
um it was actually um i actually donated

299
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,639
at 20

300
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,199
and dumped 80 percent um yeah so the

301
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:38,319
cove

302
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,278
the coved um india group got one batch

303
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
and then there's

304
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,480
another group that got another batch and

305
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,200
i don't want to say who they are because

306
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,639
i think that

307
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,640
they want to announce themselves at some

308
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,399
point sure yeah but it's uh

309
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:49,519
you know you you can see the fact that

310
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,240
these transactions were made on the

311
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,600
blockchain

312
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,399
um but it was uh just

313
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,040
very intriguing interesting and

314
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,720
unexpected and just an insanely crazy

315
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,879
situation it's been a couple weeks

316
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
first of all thank you for uh helping me

317
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:09,200
uh hang up some curtains this is

318
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,679
this is a first for the podcast and uh

319
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,360
shows

320
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:16,000
uh that you're truly a special person um

321
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,120
to be willing to help but now a couple

322
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,399
weeks later do you

323
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,240
regret any aspect of that decision um

324
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,320
i'm sure there are some things that i

325
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,639
probably could have done better like

326
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,079
i i was actually i was actually talking

327
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,360
to some of these charities and i was

328
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,199
impressed by just

329
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,800
how much money they managed to get out

330
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,680
of selling some of these coins

331
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,879
so i i probably could have done better

332
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,639
by just like

333
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:40,559
talking more with the traders and

334
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:43,360
actually ensuring that

335
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,559
you know that they can do a better job

336
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,839
of maximizing the

337
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:50,639
the value of uh of

338
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,040
uh all of them but like you know it was

339
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:52,958
a

340
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,399
very stressful time and i did have to

341
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:56,479
act quickly like i yeah

342
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,679
i did manage to you know make a lot of

343
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,519
the donations before

344
00:10:57,679 --> 00:11:00,879
like a few a few days before the great

345
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,399
crypto crash happened

346
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:06,958
uh so it was and

347
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,799
it's difficult to like obviously there's

348
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:10,159
parallel universes in which i did better

349
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,319
but at the same time

350
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:14,240
there's also lots of parallel universes

351
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,760
where because i hesitated more

352
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,519
and tried to spend more time thinking i

353
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:20,000
missed the opportunity uh

354
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
so you know on that it's like a luck of

355
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,399
the draw and i'm just

356
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,320
you know happy that uh it was

357
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,639
everything was able to turn out as well

358
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,839
as it did but psychologically

359
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,919
you mentioned stress how hard was it

360
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,680
uh it was stressful right i think well

361
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:36,879
one of the really stressful parts was

362
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,078
just the fact that

363
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:42,078
i had to basically move all of my funds

364
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,919
you know including the 325

365
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,319
000 ether from one cold wallet into

366
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:49,278
another hot wallet or sorry into another

367
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,800
multi-sig wallet um and you know maybe

368
00:11:49,278 --> 00:11:51,519
the multisig wallet had a bug in it

369
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:53,359
maybe

370
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,039
there's like some mistake i'll make in

371
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
the middle that causes the the funds to

372
00:11:55,039 --> 00:12:00,000
get lost like you know that's

373
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,759
that part was stressful and i i was

374
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
definitely stressing out for two days

375
00:12:01,759 --> 00:12:04,639
i'm you know triple checking the new

376
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,600
wallet i even did a bit of an audit of

377
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,879
the code myself

378
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,000
i wrote my own javascript to adapt to

379
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:12,480
make confirmations

380
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,600
because gnosis safe didn't work with the

381
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,639
status wallet well

382
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,240
um so there was definite

383
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,240
that whole thing was definitely a bit of

384
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,600
a marathon um i was also

385
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,240
a kind of definitely a bit worried about

386
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,278
or

387
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,799
uncertain i guess how the public and you

388
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:30,480
know including the coin communities

389
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,919
would perceive the whole thing

390
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,480
um but i was actually impressed like i

391
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,519
yeah for every poster that was saying

392
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,920
like no

393
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,480
you know why yeah why did vitalik like

394
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,078
rugby on ice he was simple

395
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,839
his wallet was supposed to be a burn

396
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,719
address you know there's like 10 people

397
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,040
that are like

398
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,240
oh you know i thought i was just in this

399
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:52,078
because it's a

400
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,320
it's a fun pyramid gambling thing but

401
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,759
instead i ended up being part of this

402
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,200
you know great public good thing for

403
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,000
humanity and that's like even more

404
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,560
amazing

405
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,200
uh so the i the amount of that that i

406
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:04,638
got was

407
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,519
very impressive so you know all in all

408
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,480
let me know i think

409
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,480
the dog people did great the dog people

410
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,440
is there something you can extend

411
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,959
to the bigger picture of it in the

412
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
principles you apply to making this

413
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:18,239
decision

414
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,200
is there some principles philosophies

415
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,639
that you apply

416
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,839
also to uh the decisions you make around

417
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,360
ethereum um um i think uh

418
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,079
a big one for me is just this idea that

419
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,800
crypto you know isn't just an

420
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,679
opportunity

421
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,479
to give people like slightly better ways

422
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:38,000
to sit to

423
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,240
save value and all these things like

424
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,120
it's also an opportunity

425
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,198
to like basically create these like new

426
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,519
digital institutions that could

427
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,559
serve the public good in new ways and

428
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,240
and

429
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:52,559
that's something that i've been

430
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,399
interested in for a long time i actually

431
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,039
even have this article in bitcoin

432
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,958
magazine back in 2014 where i basically

433
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:00,799
suggested this idea that you know you

434
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:02,078
would have coins that represent causes

435
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:04,078
and like people would just like

436
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,359
buy and accept those coins because they

437
00:14:04,078 --> 00:14:07,679
support those causes

438
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,519
so i think it's called markets

439
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,039
institutions and currencies a new form

440
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,839
of social incentivization or something

441
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,120
like that oh my god

442
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,880
and i'm sure you can find it and throw

443
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,399
it in the links um yeah

444
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,639
the so that was interesting to kind of

445
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:21,519
see becoming real and like in general i

446
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,278
mean i think

447
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,278
you know public goods are very important

448
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,958
and on the internet public goods are

449
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,519
even more important right like every

450
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,359
single lex friedman podcast is just

451
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,360
on youtube and you know anyone can go

452
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,639
and see it like there's no way for you

453
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,120
to like

454
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,799
you know sell it and so that some people

455
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,320
can see it but other people can't see it

456
00:14:38,799 --> 00:14:42,159
like you know you could do that but then

457
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,079
you'd obviously be you know reducing

458
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:47,120
your impact so thank you for making the

459
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,078
uh the amazing lex freeman podcast still

460
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,799
freely available

461
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:53,278
well that's actually a tense thing is uh

462
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:55,439
how do you do it in a way that's not uh

463
00:14:53,278 --> 00:14:56,480
controlled in a centralized fashion

464
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,440
because actually

465
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,879
youtube feels free and open but it

466
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,480
nevertheless is one company making

467
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,879
centralized decisions and

468
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,680
the first time i realized youtube was

469
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:08,720
not forever

470
00:15:05,679 --> 00:15:10,638
is when a lot of the joe rogan

471
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,360
experience library was pulled from

472
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,959
youtube as part of the spotify deal

473
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,560
and he made me realize we need to uh

474
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,879
it's like the realization that fiat

475
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:24,638
money is centralized

476
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:26,320
is uh realizing that you know they

477
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,639
this is not forever and you might want

478
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,519
to come up with schemes to distribute it

479
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,519
to uh decentralize the control of it in

480
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,560
a way that audio for podcasters was just

481
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,879
an rss feed

482
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,559
exactly yeah and i think one of the kind

483
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,000
of philosophical things that i hope to

484
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,638
achieve is kind of

485
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,278
decouple the concept of public goods

486
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,639
which are

487
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,799
incredibly important and are the

488
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:50,000
lifeblood of modern civilization

489
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:52,399
from the the idea that there nick

490
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,320
is there can be one central organization

491
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,480
that represents the public and

492
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,920
like perfectly unders uh understands and

493
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,639
can impose their idea of what is the

494
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:01,198
good

495
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,240
right like it's when people talk about

496
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,559
public goods

497
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,320
it just often comes with this baggage of

498
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,359
uh you know either centralization or

499
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,199
conformism

500
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,720
and i think like it doesn't have to

501
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,799
right like uh often

502
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,079
the most important public goods are the

503
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:15,519
ones that are created by

504
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:17,519
you know the crazy individual that's

505
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,560
that disagree with everyone else

506
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:23,519
so trying to make this kind of

507
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,278
synthesis where you combine the values

508
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,480
of decentralization and the values of

509
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,360
open source

510
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,480
but you're not naive about it and like

511
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,600
you know you realize

512
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:35,360
um that for these things to be produced

513
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,040
there needs to be a way for it to be

514
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,480
sustainable there needs to be

515
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,559
some way of supporting people who are

516
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,000
working these projects but at the same

517
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,799
time you want to

518
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,759
avoid that turning into a vector of

519
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:49,439
centralization

520
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,879
like trying to sort of get all of the

521
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,040
good things without the bad things

522
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:56,639
to me that's a yeah a big part of

523
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,719
sort of what my grand experiment in

524
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,360
crypto is about and and

525
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
like we are doing things in different

526
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,440
kinds of things for this right like

527
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,199
there's

528
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,959
the the git coin grants quadratic

529
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,919
funding in the ethereum ecosystem

530
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,199
um there's i mean obviously these uh dog

531
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:14,319
coins that just happens

532
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,519
like i guess accidentally um there's

533
00:17:14,318 --> 00:17:17,838
other projects

534
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,519
um that like for example you know

535
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:21,678
uniswap has um

536
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:22,558
their uniswap dao that just has a huge

537
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,720
amount of funding

538
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,838
and like we haven't seen yet how that's

539
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,078
going to be deployed but

540
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,759
you know it could be potentially

541
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,599
deployed to do lots of really good and

542
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,160
amazing things

543
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,000
do you see ethereum as essentially a

544
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:40,240
mechanism

545
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:45,119
to uh fight for social causes

546
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:48,319
um i definitely see ethereum as

547
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:51,759
being a mechanism to

548
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:52,558
fight for definitely some some specific

549
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,160
things that are

550
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:58,240
um that are social causes um like

551
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,080
just you know the fact of creating an

552
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,679
open financial system that anyone can

553
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,279
participate in no matter where they are

554
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,280
in the world that's a social cause

555
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,558
i'm just you know giving people the

556
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:08,480
ability to

557
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,918
organize and create projects even if

558
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,960
it's five people in five different

559
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,559
countries i think

560
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,079
that kind of inclusiveness i think

561
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,359
that's a social cause

562
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:20,480
and it's a core a core crypto value

563
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:20,879
um but then at the same time like the

564
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,120
other

565
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
important kind of part of the magic of

566
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,719
ethereum that you have to balance that

567
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,120
against is that it is also this

568
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,000
open platform where ultimately you know

569
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:32,319
the thing that go

570
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,759
the things that are on ethereum is just

571
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,519
the things that the community makes of

572
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,599
it

573
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,440
well you kind of briefly open the door

574
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,038
so let's go there

575
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:44,400
when it comes to uh government

576
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:46,319
regulation of crypto

577
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,559
uh what's the best case scenario what's

578
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:51,918
the worst case scenario

579
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,480
in terms of uh you know as you've kind

580
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,679
of mentioned

581
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,038
ethereum challenges the the the power

582
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,320
centers of the world

583
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,119
and uh how do you see the interplay

584
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,678
between govern

585
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:06,079
governments and this new technology that

586
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:09,120
resists centralized power

587
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:12,879
best case and worst case the

588
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:16,959
the best case is um that um

589
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,280
you know blockchains continue to prosper

590
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,880
and we figure out scalability is so that

591
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,440
people can actually start

592
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,880
doing things on block all you know all

593
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:26,720
of the amazing use cases that people

594
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,280
have been talking about instead of today

595
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,200
where

596
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:30,720
a lot of the great stuff gets priced out

597
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,080
because you know transaction fees are at

598
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,200
five to ten dollars

599
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:36,798
and then we see a lot of different um

600
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,960
amazing applications happening on

601
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,160
blockchains you know it could be

602
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,640
like dao is creating new ways for people

603
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,558
to

604
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,480
inter interact and organize with each

605
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,359
other new ways for artists to get funded

606
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,079
and

607
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,639
just all sorts of these amazing things

608
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,079
and

609
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,640
there's just enough public

610
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,558
um public support and just enough people

611
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,360
that see that you know look crypto is

612
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,918
clearly

613
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,599
doing a lot of good things and and you

614
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,720
know there are definitely areas where

615
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,599
there's tensions

616
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,279
but in those areas where there's

617
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:09,839
tensions like there could be some kind

618
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,839
of

619
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:13,759
creative and interesting approaches that

620
00:20:11,839 --> 00:20:16,158
get figured out right like

621
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,279
you know the concept of corporate taxes

622
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,080
for example right like

623
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,599
you know it does it that would disappear

624
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,279
as a revenue stream if theoretically

625
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,240
corporations just all get replaced by

626
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:26,798
taos but

627
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,759
i know like maybe there's some other

628
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:31,599
creative

629
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:34,480
way by which dao

630
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,839
like dao's themselves can kind of be co

631
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,640
you know have some kind of encoded

632
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,639
governance that ensures that they

633
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,640
have at least some of us some kind of

634
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,200
bias towards serving the global public

635
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,400
good

636
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,919
and you know maybe it does enough of the

637
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,679
daos can do enough of that that people

638
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,960
are happy with it and and

639
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,320
you know there are going to be things

640
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,840
that people are unhappy about there's

641
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,240
always going to be the people that

642
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:57,839
you know wants to surveil everyone but

643
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,519
if

644
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:01,839
on the the kind of effect of crypto from

645
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,158
just

646
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,439
empowering people is greater than that

647
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,120
and greater than that in a way that

648
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,400
people can just easily see

649
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:10,239
then you know that would be a good

650
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,400
scenario right and we'll just

651
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,839
like become incorpor kind of

652
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,480
incorporated and accepted the same way

653
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,879
as happened uh with the internet um

654
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,000
but the work in the worst case scenario

655
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,280
would of course be

656
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,359
just like people like suddenly you know

657
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:25,839
flipping and going into moral panic mode

658
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,918
and just

659
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,439
you know oh my god like this technology

660
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,159
is used by like you know

661
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,679
insert bad group of the day and then i

662
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,320
don't think governments have the ability

663
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,400
to

664
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:38,000
ban crypto to the extent of just

665
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,519
complete like preventing

666
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,960
blockchains from existing but they

667
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,319
definitely have the ability to really

668
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,519
marginalize it right

669
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:47,519
like if you just ban all exchanges i can

670
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:48,240
ban all links from the fiat ecosystem to

671
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,319
crypto

672
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,880
and you know you ban all kind of

673
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,558
mainstream employers from

674
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,320
accepting or paying in cryptocurrency

675
00:21:54,558 --> 00:22:00,960
then like you could

676
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:02,798
you can successfully like turn it into a

677
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,960
like you know a fairly kind of niche

678
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:06,639
counterculture thing that

679
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
has much less impact than otherwise

680
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,759
would so it's

681
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
somewhere between the good scenario in

682
00:22:09,759 --> 00:22:12,240
the bad scenario i'm obviously hoping

683
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,918
for the good

684
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,919
well that's interesting also the tension

685
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,480
between governments and

686
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,080
uh companies like if you have a bunch of

687
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:22,079
billionaires or a bunch of companies

688
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,720
like tesla investing in bitcoin

689
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,319
and then governments resisting that it's

690
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,600
interesting who wins out in that worst

691
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,279
case scenario

692
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:34,480
and almost when companies

693
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:35,440
and uh rich quote unquote respectable

694
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,159
people

695
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,880
embrace uh cryptocurrencies bitcoin

696
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,080
ethereum

697
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,000
so on even the dot coins uh it's

698
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:45,839
almost sends a signal to everybody else

699
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,119
that this is

700
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:50,639
this is a revolution that's here to stay

701
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,319
on this one little tangent that you

702
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,038
brought up

703
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:56,960
this is almost an outdated idea but it's

704
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,879
still with us which is

705
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,120
cryptocurrencies are used for illegal

706
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:04,799
activity for drugs for crime

707
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:08,079
and so on is there some sense

708
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:10,558
that worries you that if

709
00:23:08,079 --> 00:23:11,839
uh if cryptocurrency if ethereum runs

710
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,359
the world

711
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:17,119
then crime making money from crime will

712
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:19,439
be easier

713
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,359
there's always that possibility like at

714
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,759
the same time i think if you look at you

715
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,558
know

716
00:23:21,759 --> 00:23:25,200
the world as a whole and like the way

717
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,038
all the other

718
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,720
technological trends are going like you

719
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:29,759
know in-person surveillance is just

720
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,720
going up every year

721
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,240
right yeah like the if you commit a

722
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,600
crime in you know meat space it's

723
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,640
getting harder and harder to get away

724
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,439
with it

725
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,000
so like you know if he wants to do

726
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,519
something

727
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,359
and and this is something that's just

728
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,960
like happening as a result of

729
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,798
you know just better technology

730
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,278
information and information transparency

731
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:49,519
like

732
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:50,480
a lot of it's hard to prevent even if

733
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,918
you really tried

734
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:57,679
um so i the world

735
00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,159
where like things go dark to such an ex

736
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:02,000
you know as the the one the police hawks

737
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,400
sometimes like to say um to such an

738
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,319
extent

739
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,759
that like you know oh my god the

740
00:24:04,319 --> 00:24:07,278
criminals are committing crimes with

741
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,558
impunity and we can't

742
00:24:07,278 --> 00:24:11,038
see anything like that just seems

743
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,079
unlikely um but you know on the other

744
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,400
hand like

745
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:19,839
the world uh where there just

746
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,200
you know is no privacy for example or

747
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:26,879
um the world where there just like is

748
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,519
no no ability to uh kind of act

749
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,039
outside of the the confines of you know

750
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:34,000
mainstream institutions like

751
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,839
it's uh some that's something that's

752
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,640
more realistic and that seems like

753
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,439
something that uh could lead to a lot of

754
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,200
kind of

755
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,558
a lot of scary things right and like

756
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,519
even from a government's point of view

757
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,200
right like i think

758
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,200
governments over the last few years a

759
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,400
lot of them they're very worried about

760
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,759
sovereignty you know they're worried

761
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,278
about like if

762
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,000
their um country is economies and you

763
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:55,359
know social

764
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,960
environments they're just completely

765
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:57,678
dependent on basically foreign tech

766
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,200
companies

767
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,480
controlled by foreign governments like

768
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,080
you know governments are not on team

769
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,400
government right that's like you know

770
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:05,278
the indian government is on you know

771
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,559
team india

772
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,880
you know the russian government is on

773
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:12,158
team russia and so forth right so

774
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,679
like you know they don't want the us to

775
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,480
be able to like have this big backdoor

776
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,440
into everything

777
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,480
uh so i mean i do think that a balance

778
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,919
is needed but

779
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,360
at the same time i uh

780
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,640
do and think um i guess

781
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:32,558
i i definitely like worry more

782
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:36,240
about the messiah the possibility that

783
00:25:32,558 --> 00:25:38,079
just like without things like crypto

784
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,720
uh kind of acting outside of

785
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,839
institutions becomes too impossible

786
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,038
and i don't even necessarily mean

787
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:44,319
outside of governments even just you

788
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:45,759
know outside of corporations like

789
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:46,960
becomes too impossible and there's just

790
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:47,839
like terrible things that come as a

791
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,600
result

792
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:50,959
um and if things going in the other

793
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:54,079
direction like

794
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,079
it obviously is a a risk but

795
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,399
you know at the same time i think in the

796
00:25:56,079 --> 00:26:01,678
long term like a crypto can

797
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,120
potentially even like offer defenses as

798
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,440
much as attacks against that sort of

799
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,839
thing

800
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,519
yeah many throughout history many of the

801
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,599
most destructive things came from

802
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:12,158
centralized institutions versus

803
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,038
sort of from the people operating in the

804
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,120
shadows

805
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:16,720
and you know i've been talking to a

806
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:18,399
bunch of psychedelics folks

807
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,919
that people doing researchers like greg

808
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,840
doblin

809
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,679
in johns hopkins there's a lot of

810
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:25,839
exciting research on psychedelics

811
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,320
and one thing you could say about

812
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:31,439
operating at the edge of legality

813
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:34,879
it could actually accelerate the

814
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,000
adoption of particular things like

815
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,600
whether it's marijuana or psychedelics

816
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,359
they can help people out it almost

817
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,519
accelerates the policy

818
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,558
it forces the policy to catch up to

819
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,798
where the people stand

820
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,399
right so there's a positive way of doing

821
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:49,359
things that are in the gray area of

822
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,440
legality

823
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,038
and creating a market that allows people

824
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,519
to to uh

825
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:56,558
in a safe way be able to participate in

826
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:57,918
this gray area

827
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:59,678
yeah i mean the other thing to keep in

828
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,759
mind of course is that the

829
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:03,360
the set of like the kinds of things that

830
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,720
just like payment processors as

831
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,798
companies try to restrict

832
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,400
people you from is much larger than the

833
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,000
set of things that's illegal right

834
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,600
right like part of that is because they

835
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,960
want to be super conservative and like

836
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,599
the more layers you have the more

837
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,440
they're like

838
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,278
kids conservative because they're scared

839
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,880
of what what the layer below them will

840
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,558
do to them

841
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,799
sometimes they have their own you know

842
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,158
moral opinions of various kinds

843
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:25,519
you know they go after lots of people

844
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,919
right like they make life really hard

845
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:27,519
for

846
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,600
you know like sex workers for example

847
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:30,158
and like you know psychedelics as you

848
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:33,759
mentioned

849
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,559
there's uh like a lot of

850
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,158
activity even including stuff that is

851
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:39,440
totally legal that just you know there's

852
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,080
this like

853
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,519
you know shadow like paypal credit card

854
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:43,918
governments or whatever you want to call

855
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,879
it and

856
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,399
no no that makes it just hard to

857
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,520
participate in this stuff so i think

858
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,798
like reducing the number of

859
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:55,278
intermediaries is definitely

860
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:58,000
normally a good thing all right let's

861
00:27:55,278 --> 00:28:00,000
talk about one of the most exciting uh

862
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,679
technologies like technically

863
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,960
philosophically

864
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,080
like socially financially in every way

865
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,159
which is ethereum

866
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,599
2.0 there's a million things to talk

867
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,000
about but at the

868
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:14,798
step one is probably a good thing to do

869
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,519
which is

870
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:20,079
can you briefly summarize your vision

871
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:21,038
how ethereum 2.0 will make ethereum more

872
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,240
scalable

873
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:27,038
secure and sustainable sure

874
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,640
so i think recently we've actually been

875
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:31,200
kind of de-emphasizing the

876
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,880
eth 2.0 branding i guess so the reason

877
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,798
behind that was that

878
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,039
originally we envisioned something more

879
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,798
like a big grand event

880
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,079
where you know all the good things would

881
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:41,679
happen at the same time and it would be

882
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:43,199
a new blockchain

883
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,880
and it would be a new protocol and

884
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,399
people would have to take a lot of

885
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,760
effort to migrate over

886
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,439
but later we've slowly changed the

887
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:52,879
roadmap over to something that's much

888
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,960
more incremental

889
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,720
right so you know proof of stake happens

890
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,159
kind of over time and then sharding gets

891
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,360
added over time and all these features

892
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,760
get added over time

893
00:28:59,359 --> 00:29:02,639
and so the experience for just a regular

894
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,640
ethereum user

895
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,559
still feels very seamless right it's

896
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,320
like maybe a little bit more complex

897
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:10,879
than the hard forks that we've already

898
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:11,359
done but from a user's point of view but

899
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,640
like

900
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:17,519
not by that much right uh so like

901
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,640
the big two things that are happening

902
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,079
right these are

903
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,000
what used to be considered the two

904
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:22,798
flagship features of use 2.0 and now

905
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,119
they're just you know

906
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:26,000
the flagship features of the you know

907
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,798
the next uh

908
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,519
evolution of ethereum yeah as uh proof

909
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:32,639
of stake

910
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:34,158
and sharding right so proof of stake is

911
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,799
a consensus algorithm

912
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:38,159
it's the or it's not just mechanism i

913
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,319
should say um it's

914
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,760
the difference is that like an algorithm

915
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:42,480
is something that you run by yourself a

916
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:44,960
mechanism

917
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,240
is like it involves interactions between

918
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,679
people and it could even include

919
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:51,120
incentives and all of that

920
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:54,320
uh so the consensus mechanism

921
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:56,639
uh so by which nodes in

922
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,319
the network agree on you know which

923
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,360
blocks came in which transactions came

924
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,439
in in what order

925
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,038
uh make sure that once a block gets

926
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,919
accepted it can't get reverted and all

927
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:05,759
of these

928
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,080
things that we expect from a blockchain

929
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:09,839
um so existing blockchains you know

930
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:10,960
including bitcoin including the ethereum

931
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,398
of today and including

932
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,720
a lot of them they use proof of work

933
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:17,839
right uh so

934
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:21,519
the reason why we need proof of anything

935
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:23,918
is be it is because like they serve this

936
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,359
function that i call kind of economic

937
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,120
civil resistance

938
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:28,879
so that's obviously you know a big word

939
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,079
for

940
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,080
especially if you've never heard of

941
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:33,439
sybil's before but like the basic idea

942
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:34,879
is right that you have a network and you

943
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,960
have lots of computers that

944
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,559
agree on like which block to accept and

945
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,000
sometimes you get you know two blocks

946
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:41,519
that get published at the same time and

947
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,759
you just have to agree on an order so

948
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:45,359
there has to be some kind of voting game

949
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,278
yeah but then the question is well in

950
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,278
this voting game you know who get who

951
00:30:47,278 --> 00:30:51,519
gets a vote who gets to participate

952
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:53,038
now the pro you can't say one person one

953
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:54,879
vote right the reason why you cannot say

954
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,960
one person one vote is because

955
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,640
you need some kind of like authority or

956
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,278
some kind of mechanism to say you know

957
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,320
who the

958
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:03,200
the humans are like and if you don't

959
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,798
have that then

960
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,798
a bad guy could just come in with a

961
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:07,119
virtual machine or with a computer that

962
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,960
has

963
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:11,119
on it 10 billion virtual machines that

964
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,278
have 10 billion you know virtual nodes

965
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:15,278
and then just like say look i'm 99 of

966
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:18,720
the network i should control everything

967
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,079
uh so to prevent this what proof of work

968
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,640
and proof of stake both do

969
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,158
is they basically say well the weight of

970
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,440
your vote like how much influence

971
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,919
your votes have in the consensus

972
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,679
is proportional to like what quantity of

973
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,519
economic resources you bring in

974
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,200
so in the case of proof of work you

975
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,720
prove what economic resources you have

976
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,440
because your economic resources are

977
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,960
computers

978
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,798
and you prove that you have them by just

979
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,919
running them 24 7 using

980
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:45,759
these hash algorithms right so this does

981
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:46,000
solve the problem right because in order

982
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,038
to

983
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,240
attack the network you have to come in

984
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,158
with more computers

985
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,440
and more money invested into computers

986
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,120
and electricity

987
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,440
than the rest of the network puts

988
00:31:55,119 --> 00:32:00,158
together and that's extremely expensive

989
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,679
in proof-of-stake instead of relying on

990
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,640
people with computers that are

991
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,840
just constantly cranking out hashes 24 7

992
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,240
you

993
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,519
as you're like a unit of economic

994
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,519
resources you just use

995
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:12,960
like holdings of coins inside the system

996
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,480
right so all of these blockchains they

997
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,960
have some kind of coin in them

998
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,319
bitcoin has bitcoin ethereum has ether

999
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,679
um you know they all have a coin

1000
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:23,599
so why not just use that as the economic

1001
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,519
the economic resource that you're using

1002
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:28,719
to like measure participation

1003
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:30,399
um so that's like the quarry

1004
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,919
distinction between proof of work and

1005
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:33,678
proof of stake um

1006
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,519
i like proof of stake and i've liked

1007
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,399
proof of stake for many years

1008
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,798
basically because like it just requires

1009
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:41,278
much

1010
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,480
less ongoing resource consumption right

1011
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:43,919
like with proof-of-work

1012
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,759
um you know you have to like actually go

1013
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,080
and buy these physical computers

1014
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,919
and these days um you know yeah they

1015
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,000
have specialized hardware asics um

1016
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:53,519
application specific integrated circuits

1017
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,919
you have to go produce them you have to

1018
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,519
go buy them and unless you have millions

1019
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,720
of dollars you know you have to buy them

1020
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,599
from one of these other people who

1021
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,360
creates them

1022
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:02,798
and those other people often end up

1023
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,759
taking a huge cut of the profits

1024
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,558
themselves

1025
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:08,398
uh and then you know you have to plug

1026
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:10,398
them in you have to just

1027
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:12,479
burn all of this electricity that's just

1028
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,158
um running 24 7. so

1029
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,159
it consumes a huge amount of energy

1030
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,880
right and it gets not just energy it

1031
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,880
also

1032
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,640
you know just to create the hardware

1033
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,840
right like people focus a lot on energy

1034
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,600
but like actually

1035
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:25,199
about half the cost of proof of work

1036
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,398
mining is the cost of the hardware

1037
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,360
um so hardware is a very big deal too um

1038
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:31,439
and you know you need

1039
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,278
this like these this really big and

1040
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,640
powerful with very specialized hardware

1041
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,679
another kind that fills up these big

1042
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,600
warehouses

1043
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:39,200
so proof of stake you don't you don't

1044
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:41,199
really need that much electricity you

1045
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,720
just need just a little bit to run right

1046
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,880
to run a regular computer

1047
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,880
um you can run proof-of-stake validators

1048
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,080
on computers that you already have

1049
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,880
um so it's just much

1050
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:54,798
less resource intensive and like this is

1051
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,240
good for a few reasons right like one is

1052
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:57,200
you know the kind of environmental

1053
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,319
rationale that

1054
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,399
you know you're not breaking the

1055
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,798
environment um the second

1056
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,000
is that you're not taking away

1057
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:05,519
electricity

1058
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,919
and like other resources from other

1059
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:09,918
people i mean like right now there's

1060
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,918
i think just today i saw a story about

1061
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,279
like iran wanting to shut down some

1062
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,559
bitcoin mining because

1063
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,000
it was just grabbing up so much

1064
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:17,679
electricity that it was you know

1065
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,079
outbidding the nearby towns and they

1066
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,440
just

1067
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,119
didn't have enough um and then there was

1068
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,280
like chia that was the one that's doing

1069
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,800
proof of like hard disk mining basically

1070
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,200
it's just like grabbing up so many hard

1071
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,119
disks

1072
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,799
there's a there's a shortage right so

1073
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,639
that's the second reason and then

1074
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,800
the third more selfish reason is that

1075
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,960
because participating in consensus

1076
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,039
does not require so much energy

1077
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,240
expenditure you don't need to pay people

1078
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:42,398
as much to participate

1079
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,759
right so like bitcoin and ethereum they

1080
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,679
both issue

1081
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,520
somewhere around four percent of the

1082
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,079
total supply every year right now

1083
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:50,878
to miners so ethereum is about 4.7

1084
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,800
million ether

1085
00:34:50,878 --> 00:34:54,960
and the current supply is about 115

1086
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,879
million but with proof of stake like we

1087
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,000
expect it'll be somewhere between

1088
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:03,039
500 000 and one and one million per year

1089
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,358
um so so that means you know this

1090
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:06,639
the supply doesn't have to you know

1091
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:10,239
increase so quickly

1092
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:12,239
um so one of the pros that uh

1093
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,959
that people sort of argue for the proof

1094
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,078
of work is that uh it is secure because

1095
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,720
it's much more difficult

1096
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,839
to sort of as you've highlighted is

1097
00:35:18,719 --> 00:35:23,439
difficult to participate

1098
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:25,119
is there um is what are your thoughts

1099
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,639
about the security

1100
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,880
of the proof-of-stake mechanism

1101
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,559
is is there ways to make it secure so i

1102
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,519
think proof of stake is very secure uh

1103
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:36,400
because

1104
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,838
in order to be able to attack the system

1105
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,920
you need to have like

1106
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:41,119
basically as much stake as the rest of

1107
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,039
the network right

1108
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:44,880
so that means like right now for example

1109
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:46,159
we have five million each staking so you

1110
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,599
have to come up with five million each

1111
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:50,960
and then join the network

1112
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,880
and then the the other so five million

1113
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,559
ethers a lot right it's like um

1114
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,559
how much is it now like 15 billion

1115
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,199
dollars so that's actually more than

1116
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,400
i i believe the cost of attacking the

1117
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:02,319
bitcoin network

1118
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,320
and then the second thing is that

1119
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,680
recovering from attacks is much easier

1120
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,559
in proof-of-stake than proof-of-work

1121
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,719
right because

1122
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,559
in proof-of-stake you have like first of

1123
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:12,000
all we have for many kinds of attacks

1124
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,679
that you do against this network

1125
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,519
we have this concept of like automatic

1126
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:16,000
slashing right which basically means

1127
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:18,960
that

1128
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,480
in order to like revert a finalized

1129
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,800
block so if there's one block that's

1130
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,039
like

1131
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,400
accepted by the network and you try to

1132
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,838
convince the network to

1133
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,680
kind of revert that block and accept a

1134
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:28,799
different block in order to make that

1135
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,118
kind of attack

1136
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,839
you basically have to have your

1137
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,599
validator

1138
00:36:31,838 --> 00:36:35,838
like a big portion of your validators

1139
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,599
signed to conflicting messages

1140
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:39,119
and this is something that like once

1141
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,000
these messages are on the network you

1142
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,000
can go and prove like

1143
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,119
look these people did it and so we have

1144
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,119
this feature in the protocol

1145
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:47,039
called slashing where you basically take

1146
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,160
all these people who provably misbehaved

1147
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:49,920
and you burn their coins

1148
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:52,639
right and you don't burn anyone else's

1149
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,599
coins now there are other cases like for

1150
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:55,519
example

1151
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,359
if instead of reverting blocks the

1152
00:36:55,519 --> 00:36:59,920
attack just tries to censor everyone

1153
00:36:57,358 --> 00:37:01,358
right then what you do everyone who got

1154
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,880
censored would just like basically

1155
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:04,880
create the minority chain

1156
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,320
um and then the community would

1157
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,599
basically have to do a soft fork right

1158
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,000
they would just have to say like look

1159
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,440
this chain

1160
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,119
is clearly attacking us this chain is

1161
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,320
the one not attacking us and so we're

1162
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,240
going to join this chain

1163
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,400
and then what happens is that on that

1164
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,118
new chain the attackers also lose a lot

1165
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,039
of coins

1166
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,640
right yeah so the difference between

1167
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:22,320
proof of stake and proof of work

1168
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:24,559
is that in a proof-of-stake system like

1169
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,760
you can identify specific participants

1170
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,838
and you can say you know

1171
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,440
these and like this isn't like you know

1172
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:30,480
a human going in and saying i don't like

1173
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,159
you i don't like you i don't like you

1174
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,760
this is like automated right

1175
00:37:32,159 --> 00:37:35,519
you can so the slashing process is

1176
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,680
automated yes

1177
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,358
is there ways it can go wrong so that's

1178
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,719
a painful process where the coins are

1179
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,920
burned

1180
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:46,078
um it is painful yes i think uh

1181
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,039
i mean the one big unknown of course is

1182
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,119
like if

1183
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,800
an attack actually happens and like if

1184
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:52,320
an attack happens that requires the

1185
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,839
community to actually choose one of

1186
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,119
these minority forks

1187
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:58,880
then like what would the the community

1188
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,320
actually successfully coordinating on

1189
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,119
this look like right like

1190
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,640
it's like you know we can talk about it

1191
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,400
and we can you know write

1192
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:08,000
like science fiction novels about it but

1193
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,440
like until it's happened you don't

1194
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,880
really know the details of like what it

1195
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,320
looks like and how difficult it is

1196
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,240
what are the channels of communication

1197
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:16,640
for the community if you can

1198
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:19,358
enlighten me a little bit like what you

1199
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:19,838
know uh in many ways in the political

1200
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:22,000
realm

1201
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,239
twitter is often used as a way to kind

1202
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,838
of have these emerging phenomena of

1203
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,159
large groups of people coming to a

1204
00:38:25,838 --> 00:38:30,320
consensus right about a particular idea

1205
00:38:28,159 --> 00:38:31,679
and then there's battle for consensus

1206
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:35,119
what's uh

1207
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:37,598
in the ethereum community how do people

1208
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,358
what are the sources of natural language

1209
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:41,599
based communication

1210
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:43,838
that have an emergent belief structure

1211
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,838
that you would say

1212
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,599
or is it all through money is it all

1213
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:48,000
through trading that the communication

1214
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,240
happens

1215
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,480
there's definitely talking as well um i

1216
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:53,919
mean like we have to agree on protocol

1217
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,358
changes somehow right like there's

1218
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,480
twitter there's reddit

1219
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,400
there's um github there's uh

1220
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,719
all of the various ethereum forums

1221
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,960
ethereum magicians ethereum research

1222
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:06,159
there's just in-person communication

1223
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,679
then there's just kind of like the

1224
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:09,118
hidden web of everyone talking to

1225
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:12,639
everyone on telegram

1226
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,200
um or signal uh so it's like some of

1227
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:16,239
everything

1228
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:17,519
right but i think like the thing to

1229
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:19,358
emphasize around like

1230
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:20,639
can you actually come to consensus on

1231
00:39:19,358 --> 00:39:22,239
you know whether or not to

1232
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,239
fork the chain because the attacker is

1233
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:25,439
censoring some everyone just for example

1234
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,000
is like

1235
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,960
you everyone who's running a node is

1236
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,800
going to see

1237
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,400
almost the same thing right like they're

1238
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,000
going to be off by a few seconds and

1239
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,440
like maybe they'll be off by a few

1240
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,599
they'll disagree by a few minutes but

1241
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,119
like if it's a serious attack you know

1242
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,800
people are gonna know right it's not

1243
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,119
like one of those things where you know

1244
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,359
oh

1245
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,519
it we're trying to agree on like i don't

1246
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:46,719
know did epstein kill himself or like

1247
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:48,400
some you know

1248
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,919
read the political facts for like in

1249
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,358
reality no one knows a single thing

1250
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,480
about what's actually going on and

1251
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,880
they're all speculating

1252
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:55,760
like it is much more visible right so we

1253
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,519
do have that

1254
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:59,200
but you know at the same time i'm happy

1255
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:02,239
to admit that like

1256
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:03,598
these are fairly untested mechanisms but

1257
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:05,199
like at the same time they're also

1258
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,680
untested mechanisms and proof of work

1259
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:07,039
right

1260
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:08,879
and like in proof of work it's even

1261
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:10,719
harder because in proof of work you

1262
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,440
don't have the ability to like identify

1263
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,838
and say

1264
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,280
like you know i'm going to these miners

1265
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:16,318
attacked and so we're not going to let

1266
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,920
these my um

1267
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,079
these miners in these miners do not

1268
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,440
attack so we're going to keep them in

1269
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,160
like you have to pretty much you know

1270
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,679
either take out none of the miners or

1271
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:27,118
you do a fork that changes the proof of

1272
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,719
work algorithm which takes out all of

1273
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,440
the miners right so

1274
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:33,039
the the economics of like recovering

1275
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,519
from attacks and proof of work at least

1276
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:36,880
to me

1277
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:38,880
actually do seem more unfavorable

1278
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,480
but you know i'm sure the proof of work

1279
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,480
people you talk to will give a very

1280
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,039
different and contradictory opinions and

1281
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,199
that's

1282
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:47,039
totally fine and amazing some people

1283
00:40:45,199 --> 00:40:48,960
describe mev

1284
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,599
minor extractable value as an

1285
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,920
existential risk to ethereum

1286
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,960
what is mev how important is it to solve

1287
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:57,200
an mvv

1288
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,039
if it's important what ideas do you have

1289
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,399
sure how about after this one we'll also

1290
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,318
talk about sharding because that's

1291
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,680
amazing and it's part of the return back

1292
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:05,920
to sharding and

1293
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,838
which is no no return to the big picture

1294
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,000
of the scaling problem as you mentioned

1295
00:41:07,838 --> 00:41:12,719
i love this conversation you know depth

1296
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,838
first search instead of brett first

1297
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:18,480
so uh basically okay ebbyv

1298
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,838
minor extractable value um it is not

1299
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,440
different in proof of work and proof of

1300
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:21,759
stake right so like if you want to call

1301
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,519
it

1302
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,119
you know block proposal extractable

1303
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:26,880
value like it sounds a lot sexy but you

1304
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,760
know we can call it bpef instead of math

1305
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,559
who cares

1306
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,000
um but so this is a problem in both

1307
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,599
proof of work and proof of stake

1308
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:39,199
yes so the basic idea is

1309
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:41,359
that if you have the ability to choose

1310
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:42,480
which transactions go into a block and

1311
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:44,559
in what order

1312
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,318
then you have the ability to like take

1313
00:41:44,559 --> 00:41:46,799
advantage of that position for economic

1314
00:41:46,318 --> 00:41:48,639
gain

1315
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,000
in a lot more ways than just collecting

1316
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:52,000
transaction fees right

1317
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,920
like for example there's decentralized

1318
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,440
exchanges on chain like uniswap

1319
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,800
and like let's say the price of eth

1320
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:02,480
versus usdc was 2700

1321
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,720
the previous block but then there was a

1322
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,079
bit of a market drop and now it's 26.80

1323
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,919
where you can go on unit swap and you

1324
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,480
can just like gobble up the entire part

1325
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,800
of

1326
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:13,519
um you know the automated order book

1327
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,318
that's like between 2700 and 26.80 right

1328
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,159
and that's

1329
00:42:14,318 --> 00:42:17,519
and then at the same time you like run a

1330
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:18,719
bot and uh

1331
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:20,480
you know you buy some yeast back at

1332
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:22,559
26.80 and you've just like made about 10

1333
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,000
dollars of profit right so

1334
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:25,759
or well 10 dollars times you know

1335
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,760
whatever the depth is right so and

1336
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,640
so there's lots of um little things like

1337
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,160
that there's also things um that involve

1338
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:34,639
like front running other people's

1339
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,199
transactions so one example of this

1340
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,000
would be

1341
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:39,919
that if someone sends a transaction that

1342
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,599
says

1343
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:46,400
buy me five eth for um

1344
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,838
whatever price that you can get um then

1345
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,680
but with a maximum of

1346
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,159
let's say yeah uh 15 000 then you can go

1347
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:54,318
and like

1348
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,759
you can send each put a transaction

1349
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:57,519
right in front of that transaction

1350
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,960
and you can like buy up that east first

1351
00:42:57,519 --> 00:43:00,559
and then you resell it to him at you

1352
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,039
know fifteen thousand dollars minus one

1353
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,400
yeah so there's then you get to make a

1354
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,679
little bit of money though exactly so

1355
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,280
there's a lot of these different like

1356
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:08,480
arbitrage front running back running

1357
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,280
these different tricks

1358
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,159
that allow block proposers to to get

1359
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,800
some percentage

1360
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:16,559
on top like overhead exactly and the

1361
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,000
reason why this is um

1362
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:22,159
a challenge is because um

1363
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,358
it's like first of all it's some it

1364
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,118
sometimes degrades

1365
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,559
user experience because users get you

1366
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,519
know less favorable uh

1367
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,199
trades but there are sometimes ways to

1368
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:32,880
like mitigate that for applications

1369
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:34,799
sometimes it's not that bad

1370
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,640
but like the bigger risk that i think

1371
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,440
some people consider more existential

1372
00:43:36,639 --> 00:43:40,159
is that there's just much more economies

1373
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,000
of scale

1374
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,519
in figuring out how to extract all this

1375
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:45,119
revenue i mean because if you're just

1376
00:43:43,519 --> 00:43:47,280
collecting transaction fees

1377
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,318
there aren't really economies of scale

1378
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,839
there aren't really benefits to

1379
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:51,440
centralizing right because it's a very

1380
00:43:49,838 --> 00:43:53,279
simple formula you just like grab up the

1381
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,760
transactions that pay you the most

1382
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,760
but with mev you know you ha there's all

1383
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:00,079
these sophisticated algorithms

1384
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,520
and if you have lots of money then you

1385
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,039
can hire really smart people to make

1386
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,480
amazing algorithms and then you can use

1387
00:44:03,039 --> 00:44:06,318
the other half of your money

1388
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,079
to get a lot of mining power a lot of

1389
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:09,920
stake and you get a lot of opportunities

1390
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,119
to use your even better algorithms

1391
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,480
so there's this risk that like as a

1392
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,519
result of this

1393
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,880
mining is basically or or even

1394
00:44:17,519 --> 00:44:20,000
validating proof of stake is going to

1395
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,760
centralize

1396
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:24,800
um so i think the ecosystems best reply

1397
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,960
to this sort of risk

1398
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,880
and it's the direction where projects

1399
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,240
like flashbots are going already

1400
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,640
is if you can't eliminate the

1401
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,318
centralization then you try to firewall

1402
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:39,279
it right and the way that you

1403
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:41,199
fire wallet is you basically say we're

1404
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,560
going to try to deliberately create a

1405
00:44:41,199 --> 00:44:45,279
marketplace where

1406
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:46,000
people can just do the complicated work

1407
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,920
of creating

1408
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:49,519
what are called bundles like bundles of

1409
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,880
transactions that

1410
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:54,480
like are very profitable right and then

1411
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:56,640
at the other side of the market you just

1412
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,679
have like block proposes reminders that

1413
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:00,239
are just dumb nodes

1414
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:01,838
and they go and ask the what are called

1415
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,759
searchers the bundle creators

1416
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:05,440
and they just ask like hey like how much

1417
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,560
can you give me if i put in your bundle

1418
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,119
and then they just take the highest

1419
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,880
offer

1420
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:10,480
right so you sort of separate out the

1421
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,079
task and you know you have

1422
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,760
the easy part and then you have the hard

1423
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,200
part and you have like this special

1424
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,079
class of actor called a searcher that

1425
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,799
does the hard part

1426
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,160
and then the easy part the people doing

1427
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,000
the easy part which is just miners and

1428
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,480
validators they kind of

1429
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,920
just talk to all the different people

1430
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,760
doing the searching and they just you

1431
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,880
know accept the highest bidder right

1432
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,200
so and this is also just like

1433
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:34,960
interesting uh an interesting example of

1434
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:37,279
like economic design philosophy

1435
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:39,039
right like sometimes you can't just like

1436
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,319
make centralization go away sometimes

1437
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:42,559
it's inevitable but

1438
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,159
you know at least you can try to kind of

1439
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,400
contain it you can direct it

1440
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,679
or you know you can even sort of

1441
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,680
firewall it away from

1442
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,519
you know core consensus the parts that

1443
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:52,799
really do need to be decentralized

1444
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:54,719
so but you don't see it as an

1445
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,560
existential risk it's just incredible

1446
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:57,838
it's a bit of a problem that it has to

1447
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:59,679
be constantly dealt with

1448
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:02,318
it's a i mean it's a risk like there's

1449
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,879
obviously a risk that you know there it

1450
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:06,639
it's a very severe problem and that even

1451
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,680
this flashbots approach has some fatal

1452
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,879
flaw or whatever

1453
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:12,239
um but i'm definitely like

1454
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,240
we're definitely approaching it with the

1455
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:15,759
mindset of you know this is a problem

1456
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:18,078
and like yes we do have to do some work

1457
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,720
to solve it but we're doing it and uh

1458
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:21,839
so far it's being solved okay let's talk

1459
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,439
about the other

1460
00:46:21,838 --> 00:46:27,199
really really fascinating part of uh

1461
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,800
the future of ethereum let's not call it

1462
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:31,439
ethereum 2.0

1463
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,039
but the future of ethereum that also may

1464
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,800
require a hard fork i don't know you can

1465
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:37,838
correct me on this

1466
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:40,839
is well broadly

1467
00:46:37,838 --> 00:46:42,000
ideas for scaling yes and more

1468
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:45,679
specifically

1469
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,480
sort of uh layer two or uh

1470
00:46:45,679 --> 00:46:50,000
layer one and two intersection ideas of

1471
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,240
how to achieve scaling

1472
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,039
and at the core of that is the idea of

1473
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:56,239
sharding so

1474
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:59,838
first what is sharding okay

1475
00:46:56,239 --> 00:47:01,199
uh so there's two major paradigms for

1476
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,199
scaling blockchains right as

1477
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,118
you said layer one and layer two and

1478
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:07,838
layer one basically means

1479
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:10,160
make the blockchain itself like capable

1480
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:11,679
of processing more transactions by

1481
00:47:10,159 --> 00:47:13,519
having you know some

1482
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,598
mechanism by which you can do that

1483
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:17,119
despite the fact that there's a limit to

1484
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,920
the capacity of each participant in the

1485
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:19,358
blockchain

1486
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,200
and then layer two says well we're gonna

1487
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:23,679
keep the blockchain as is

1488
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,358
but we're gonna create clever protocols

1489
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:27,118
that sit on top of the blockchain

1490
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:28,880
that still use the blockchain and then

1491
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:30,960
still kind of inherit things like the

1492
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,039
security guarantees of a blockchain

1493
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,400
but at the same time a lot of things are

1494
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,440
done off-chain and so

1495
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,599
you get more scalability that way um so

1496
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,280
in ethereum the most popular paradigm

1497
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,400
failure too is rollups and the most

1498
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,960
popular paradigm for

1499
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,119
one is sharding so one way to achieve

1500
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,000
layer one scaling is to increase the

1501
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:50,880
block size

1502
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,119
yes hence the block size wars quote

1503
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,720
unquote and uh you actually tweeted

1504
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:57,200
something about

1505
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:59,598
uh people are saying that vitalik

1506
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:02,399
changed his mind about the in it

1507
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,680
he went from being a small i went from

1508
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,400
being big to small

1509
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:08,078
big small of them and uh but you said

1510
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,240
i've been a medium

1511
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:11,599
blocker all along so maybe you can also

1512
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,000
comment on on where

1513
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:15,599
on the very basic aspect before you even

1514
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,480
get the sharding of where you stand on

1515
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,200
this block

1516
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,800
size debate sure so the way that i think

1517
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:22,159
about the trade-off is i think about it

1518
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,599
as a trade-off between

1519
00:48:22,159 --> 00:48:25,279
making it easy to write to the

1520
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:26,079
blockchain and making it easy to read

1521
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:28,240
the blockchain

1522
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,079
right so when i say read i just mean you

1523
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,519
know have a node and actually verify it

1524
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,318
and make sure that it's correct and all

1525
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:33,519
of those things

1526
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:35,679
and then by right i mean send

1527
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,759
transactions so like

1528
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:39,358
i think for decentralization it's

1529
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,160
important for both of these tasks to be

1530
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:41,598
accessible

1531
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:43,519
and i think that they're like about

1532
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,200
equally important right if you have a

1533
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:47,280
chain that's too expensive to read then

1534
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,039
everyone will just trust a few people to

1535
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,400
like read for them and then those people

1536
00:48:49,039 --> 00:48:51,679
can change the rules without anyone

1537
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,680
else's permission

1538
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:55,199
but if on the other hand it becomes

1539
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:58,639
really expensive to write

1540
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:00,719
then everyone will move on to basically

1541
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:03,039
second layer systems that are incredibly

1542
00:49:00,719 --> 00:49:03,439
centralized and like that takes away

1543
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:04,639
from

1544
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,960
you know decentralization and

1545
00:49:04,639 --> 00:49:08,400
self-sovereignty as well so

1546
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:09,838
this has been my viewpoints like pretty

1547
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,200
much the whole time right it's that like

1548
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:12,719
you know you need this balance and going

1549
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:14,239
in one direction or the other direction

1550
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:16,239
is very unhealthy

1551
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,679
in the bitcoin case um basically what

1552
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,159
happens was that

1553
00:49:17,679 --> 00:49:21,679
bitcoin originally like at the very

1554
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:22,719
beginning it didn't really have a block

1555
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:25,440
size it just had

1556
00:49:22,719 --> 00:49:27,838
an accidental block size of 32 meg or a

1557
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:29,760
block size limit of 32 megabytes because

1558
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:31,039
that just happens to be the limit of the

1559
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,559
peer-to-peer messages

1560
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:34,719
um but that's interesting i didn't even

1561
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:37,440
know that part yeah but then

1562
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:39,039
um satoshi back in 2010 was worried that

1563
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,480
even 32 megabyte blocks would be too

1564
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:42,558
hard to process so he

1565
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:44,240
uh put the limit down to one megabyte

1566
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,440
and you know i think

1567
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:49,358
the i put you mean sneaked in there yeah

1568
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,119
just like made an update to the bitcoin

1569
00:49:49,358 --> 00:49:52,000
software that made blocks bigger than

1570
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:55,200
one i think it's

1571
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,519
a million bytes um invalid and

1572
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,118
i think the impression that most people

1573
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:59,599
had at the time is that you know this is

1574
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:02,640
just

1575
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,559
a temporary safety measure and over time

1576
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,318
you know though as we become more

1577
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:06,800
confident in the software that limit

1578
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:10,239
would be

1579
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:13,359
and like raised some uh somewhat

1580
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:15,679
um but ba then

1581
00:50:13,358 --> 00:50:17,279
of when the actual usage of the

1582
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,199
blockchain started going up

1583
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,480
and then it started going up first to

1584
00:50:19,199 --> 00:50:22,239
100 kilobytes

1585
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:24,480
per block then to 250 kilobytes per

1586
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:26,318
block then to 500 kilobytes per block

1587
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,318
um you know they're started kind of

1588
00:50:26,318 --> 00:50:29,920
coming out of the woodworks this opinion

1589
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:30,960
that like no that limit should just not

1590
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,400
be increased

1591
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,480
and and you know then there are all of

1592
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,119
these attempts at compromising right

1593
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,039
um you know first there's like a

1594
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,039
proposal for 20 megabyte blocks then

1595
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,679
there was the 248 proposal

1596
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:47,279
which is um a bit ironic because the 248

1597
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:49,358
proposal started off being

1598
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,359
like a small block negotiating position

1599
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:52,960
but then when the big black people came

1600
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,318
back and said like hey where are we are

1601
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:55,440
we gonna do this they're like oh no no

1602
00:50:54,318 --> 00:50:57,279
no we don't want them we don't want the

1603
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,559
block size increases anymore

1604
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,839
uh so you know there were these two

1605
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,559
different positions right the small

1606
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:05,199
blockers

1607
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,079
i think they valued one megabyte blocks

1608
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:07,838
for two reasons

1609
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:09,440
one is that they just like really really

1610
00:51:07,838 --> 00:51:11,920
believe in the importance of

1611
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,200
being able to read the chain but two is

1612
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,159
that a lot of them

1613
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:17,759
really believe in in maintaining this

1614
00:51:16,159 --> 00:51:20,000
norm of never hard forking

1615
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,760
right right so the difference between a

1616
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,400
hard fork and a soft fork is basically

1617
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,240
that

1618
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:27,838
in a soft fork um blocks that were

1619
00:51:26,239 --> 00:51:29,358
any block that's valid under the new

1620
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,920
rules was still valid under the old

1621
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:31,598
rules

1622
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,200
so if you have a client that verifies

1623
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:35,440
according to the old rules then you'll

1624
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:37,679
still be able to accept the chain

1625
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,760
that follows the new rules whereas with

1626
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,598
a hard fork like you have to

1627
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,040
update your code in order to stay on the

1628
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,880
chain

1629
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:49,358
and look they have this belief that

1630
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:51,200
you know soft forks are kind of either

1631
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,639
less coercive than hard forks which by

1632
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:54,639
the way i completely disagree with

1633
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:56,318
um i actually think soft forks are more

1634
00:51:54,639 --> 00:51:57,920
coercive because like basically they

1635
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:59,440
force everyone who disagrees to sort of

1636
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:03,039
go along by default

1637
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:06,720
um but or they have this um

1638
00:52:03,039 --> 00:52:09,599
opinion that um there's like

1639
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:11,279
it's more difficult to abuse soft forks

1640
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,800
to do really mean things like or

1641
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,800
that like completely violate people's

1642
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:16,640
expectations like increasing the supply

1643
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,800
which is again there i think there is

1644
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:20,480
some truth to that um

1645
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,839
so because of you know these reasons

1646
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:22,960
they just say we're only going to do

1647
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:24,558
soft forks and we

1648
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:26,079
don't we wants to just not do any hard

1649
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:27,760
forks and

1650
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:29,359
they eventually discovered this idea

1651
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:30,720
called segregated witness that allows

1652
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:32,318
for like a very tiny

1653
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:34,239
block size increase to like the

1654
00:52:32,318 --> 00:52:37,440
equivalent of about two megabytes

1655
00:52:34,239 --> 00:52:38,159
um with a soft fork it's it's just a

1656
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,000
really

1657
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:43,679
like weird and devious trick like

1658
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:46,159
basically what they do is

1659
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:47,598
they take the signatures of transactions

1660
00:52:46,159 --> 00:52:48,159
and then they put them outside of the

1661
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,920
block

1662
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:51,920
and then they add an extra rule that

1663
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,599
says that like every for a block to be

1664
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:55,358
valid the blog has to come with

1665
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:56,880
a separate like basically extension

1666
00:52:55,358 --> 00:52:58,239
block that contains all of the

1667
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,000
transaction signatures

1668
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:01,439
right so you know when you measure it

1669
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,719
according to the old rules like you know

1670
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,079
hey it adds up to less than a million

1671
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:04,879
but actually there's this extension

1672
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,960
block that

1673
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,200
the old protocol doesn't even know about

1674
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,838
so it's a hack that that seemed to work

1675
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:12,879
to do

1676
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:14,480
in a small way extend exactly but so

1677
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:16,000
you know small block side was like happy

1678
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,000
with these very low levels of block size

1679
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,159
and the big block side wanted to

1680
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,920
expand to you know at the very least go

1681
00:53:20,159 --> 00:53:23,759
to four megabytes then you know maybe go

1682
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,760
maybe eight twenty there are there's

1683
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,960
disagreements within there as well

1684
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:29,920
um i definitely was uh favoring the big

1685
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,000
side um

1686
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,960
the whole way through as you can

1687
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,280
probably tell

1688
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:36,960
um but even though so the argument

1689
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,160
against the big

1690
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,880
is that uh it uh makes things more

1691
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:42,799
centralized

1692
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,160
yes because fewer people can run and

1693
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,079
know that verifies the chain

1694
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:47,679
and also because any of these things

1695
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,200
would require a hard fork and

1696
00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:50,960
you know hard forks or inherently risky

1697
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:53,679
do you think there's truth to that

1698
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,639
um i'm pro hard fork i think hard forks

1699
00:53:53,679 --> 00:53:57,118
are actually like

1700
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:59,199
in a yeah you know political economic

1701
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:01,358
sense they're better than soft forks

1702
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:02,960
well let's okay okay i think it's a

1703
00:54:01,358 --> 00:54:06,078
beautiful

1704
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:08,960
principle as stated that soft

1705
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:10,640
forks may be more coarse coercive than

1706
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:12,159
hard forks

1707
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:14,318
this this is not just about

1708
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:18,799
cryptocurrency this is about

1709
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:20,960
politics and life that's fascinating so

1710
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,480
you're okay with hard forks in fact you

1711
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,800
think hard forks

1712
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,639
is the right way to make changes because

1713
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,440
then everybody's forced to make a

1714
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:28,960
decision

1715
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:31,519
right do you accept this change or not

1716
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,440
as opposed to ideas being sneaked

1717
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,800
in behind the door and you're and the

1718
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,240
decisions forced on you

1719
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:40,079
exactly yeah okay so but you know

1720
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:42,159
hard fork some people say this is when

1721
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,079
they talk about sort of ethereum

1722
00:54:42,159 --> 00:54:45,838
is there's some aspect to a hard fork

1723
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,160
where you're trying to

1724
00:54:45,838 --> 00:54:49,440
upgrade a what is it airplane while it's

1725
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,920
flying

1726
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:53,440
and uh i think softworks are also

1727
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,079
upgrading an airplane while it's flying

1728
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,559
but it's just smaller upgrades

1729
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,119
that's like there's some truth to that

1730
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,599
like

1731
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:04,079
there's definitely um there's definitely

1732
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:05,599
a bit more risk of like a split as a

1733
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,000
result of a hard fork then as a result

1734
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:09,119
of a soft

1735
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,480
fork um and this split is highly

1736
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,318
undesirable right

1737
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,079
well it depends like if it's a split

1738
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:16,000
because of a bug then that's horrible

1739
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:17,680
if it's a split as a result of political

1740
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,400
differences then i think like

1741
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:22,480
a split is better than you know one side

1742
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,358
being forced to basically just like suck

1743
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,960
it up and

1744
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,119
accept the majority position even if it

1745
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,720
really hates it

1746
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,000
well there's also political connections

1747
00:55:28,719 --> 00:55:32,318
throughout the history of the united

1748
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,400
states it's like sometimes

1749
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:35,679
groups of people that strongly disagree

1750
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,720
with each other

1751
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:40,719
should be forced to work it out

1752
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,639
even if they even when a split seems

1753
00:55:40,719 --> 00:55:44,719
like an easy thing in the short term

1754
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:47,679
it depends and i think like well for

1755
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:49,439
blockchains in particular the costs of

1756
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:51,358
people being able to like peacefully do

1757
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:52,720
their go off and do their own thing or

1758
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:54,239
much lower right like

1759
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:56,879
you know okay if you have a country and

1760
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:59,598
you have two groups then

1761
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,798
like often enough like fighting out the

1762
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,000
new rules requires

1763
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:03,519
you know a civil war it requires

1764
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,960
everyone to move and so forth but no no

1765
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:07,920
on a blockchain like you know

1766
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,599
the costs are lower and so so if you

1767
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,599
were to look at the way things worked

1768
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,160
out with the block size wars

1769
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,160
and there was a split what is the

1770
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:19,358
bitcoin cash and bitcoin

1771
00:56:16,159 --> 00:56:21,519
yeah um would you like you

1772
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:22,960
looking putting on your historian hat

1773
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:23,920
you mentioned offline you like dan

1774
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,400
carlin

1775
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,920
so if dan carlin went to do an episode

1776
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:31,280
on the

1777
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,119
on the block size wars uh do you think

1778
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,440
uh it could have turned out better or do

1779
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:35,760
you

1780
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,599
um are you okay with the way it turned

1781
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:40,400
out

1782
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:42,240
i'm definitely disappointed with what

1783
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,200
happened with the block with the the big

1784
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,118
block side

1785
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:46,879
um i think the source of my

1786
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:49,119
disappointment is that like

1787
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,200
one of the things that you notice when

1788
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:53,200
just looking at like this political

1789
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,279
disagreements generally especially when

1790
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:55,598
you have environments where you know

1791
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,200
they're

1792
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,880
authoritarian or like single party

1793
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:00,159
dominated and then there's some

1794
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,079
opposition party

1795
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,279
and the opposition often has like very

1796
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,559
legitimate grievances

1797
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,920
but at the same time the thing you

1798
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,599
notice is that often enough the

1799
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,400
opposition just sucks right like it just

1800
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,480
doesn't have

1801
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,000
you know political capacity it doesn't

1802
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:15,119
have like the ability to

1803
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:17,599
come up with policy because its

1804
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:19,039
entire culture is like designed around

1805
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:20,480
resisting much more and then it's

1806
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:22,079
designed around like you know

1807
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,000
actually debating serious policy

1808
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,119
trade-offs and

1809
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,239
i i worry or i guess not so much worry

1810
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:31,119
because it's already happened

1811
00:57:28,239 --> 00:57:33,199
i uh unfortunately think that bitcoin

1812
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:36,160
cash ended up being a victim of this

1813
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:37,838
right like um first no there was a split

1814
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:39,039
with bitcoin cash and then of course

1815
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,159
craig wright came in

1816
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:43,920
and you know craig wright was uh this

1817
00:57:42,159 --> 00:57:46,239
basically scammer who just keeps on

1818
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,400
pretending that he is satoshi nakamoto

1819
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:50,399
the inventor of uh bitcoin hey craig

1820
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,160
wright's legal team do you hear me yes i

1821
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,160
still think your client is a scammer

1822
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:55,759
so sue me this is definitely gonna be

1823
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:56,879
depth first search because i gotta ask

1824
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,920
you about craigslist

1825
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,680
because these people have been

1826
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,240
contacting me and i'm trying to figure

1827
00:57:59,679 --> 00:58:02,798
out like

1828
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:04,078
what is up with this human being so for

1829
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:07,599
people who don't know

1830
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,359
there's somebody who is let's start

1831
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,680
there's satoshi nakamoto who is the

1832
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:14,719
creator of bitcoin is anonymous

1833
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:17,598
and actually most really big people in

1834
00:58:14,719 --> 00:58:20,798
the cryptocurrency space

1835
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:23,440
do not like like yourself and others

1836
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:25,119
do not dare claim that they are even for

1837
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,798
fun satoshi nakamoto

1838
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:28,880
in fact if satoshi nakamoto is still

1839
00:58:26,798 --> 00:58:30,400
alive and is like if say you were

1840
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,960
satisfied it seems like

1841
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,240
the thing he would do is probably or she

1842
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,159
is uh

1843
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:38,000
trying to remain anonymous on the flip

1844
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:40,639
side of that there's a guy named

1845
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,318
craig wright who continually keeps

1846
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:43,358
claiming that he is in fact satoshi

1847
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:46,798
nakamoto

1848
00:58:43,358 --> 00:58:49,279
and keeps suing a lot of people so uh

1849
00:58:46,798 --> 00:58:50,880
on on him if we could just linger on him

1850
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,519
what do you make of this character

1851
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,318
uh what what are we supposed to make of

1852
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:56,559
this character

1853
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:59,039
should he be ignored is there any

1854
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,440
possible truth to his claims

1855
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,199
um what do you make of him the the

1856
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,880
analogy that's at the side at the top of

1857
00:59:03,199 --> 00:59:06,879
my head will get a bit political but

1858
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,079
um that's fine you've had michael ballas

1859
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,480
um so

1860
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,160
um i guess i view craig wright as being

1861
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,838
kind of like a donald trump figure

1862
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:16,318
yes and that like he's not very

1863
00:59:13,838 --> 00:59:17,279
intellectual um but i think he gets a

1864
00:59:16,318 --> 00:59:21,599
big audience

1865
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:23,519
because he says he he says things

1866
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:25,519
that like play to the resentments that

1867
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:28,079
people have and he says things that

1868
00:59:25,519 --> 00:59:29,838
uh people wants to hear right like in

1869
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:31,519
the in the wake of this block size war

1870
00:59:29,838 --> 00:59:33,599
no the big blockers did feel very

1871
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:35,199
disenchanted like they felt that

1872
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,480
you know bitcoin always had this vision

1873
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:38,239
that we were supposed to just keep

1874
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:39,920
increasing the block size and bitcoin is

1875
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:40,639
pewter pure cash it says so in the white

1876
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,798
paper

1877
00:59:40,639 --> 00:59:44,078
and then this gr this elitist clique of

1878
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:45,599
core devs just like

1879
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:46,960
came in and said you know no no we're

1880
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,599
going to impose this totally different

1881
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,119
vision

1882
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,880
and if you ever want your scalability

1883
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:51,358
you'll have to wait for us to create

1884
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,280
this

1885
00:59:51,358 --> 00:59:54,798
this totally unproven fancy technology

1886
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,798
called the lightning network that works

1887
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,079
on your completely different principles

1888
00:59:56,798 --> 00:59:59,920
and you know they were very angry at

1889
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,440
this and i mean i think like i think a

1890
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:04,960
lot of that anger is justified

1891
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:07,119
um but at the same time

1892
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,720
you know when people are in that mental

1893
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,240
state like it's very easy for you to

1894
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:13,358
just kind of like latch on

1895
01:00:10,239 --> 01:00:14,798
and if you find someone who expresses

1896
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:15,759
anger at the same things that you're

1897
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:19,039
angry at

1898
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:21,280
and also like it seems like someone

1899
01:00:19,039 --> 01:00:22,798
who's strong and seems like someone who

1900
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,400
you know might be good to rally around

1901
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:24,798
it's very easy to just like get behind

1902
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:26,559
that

1903
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:28,960
but that extra part about where he

1904
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:28,960
satoshi

1905
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:34,078
i think that's um he could have done it

1906
01:00:32,318 --> 01:00:36,159
without that but that

1907
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,839
i mean that just it's a marketing

1908
01:00:36,159 --> 01:00:38,798
strategy like it sort of gives him more

1909
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:40,480
salience like

1910
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:42,000
there's other big block personalities

1911
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,639
right but what's the difference between

1912
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,880
with greg wright he's not just a big a

1913
01:00:44,639 --> 01:00:50,639
big block personality he's

1914
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:52,240
potentially satoshi um and he did say

1915
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:54,719
all the big block things right like he

1916
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:56,000
talked about how oh the concept of a fee

1917
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:58,798
market is fundamentally

1918
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,239
like economically wrong and it should be

1919
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:01,599
it should be a free market and you

1920
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,798
should be able to have walks as big as

1921
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,400
you want like he repeated all the

1922
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:06,480
talking points and so

1923
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,599
a lot of people were kind of sucked into

1924
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,960
that right

1925
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,240
and so he unfortunately was able to

1926
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:14,000
basically dominate

1927
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,399
a big part of the bitcoin cash community

1928
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:18,639
for a long time and then

1929
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:20,639
eventually if of course um you know more

1930
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:22,480
and more people started to catch on

1931
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:24,078
um he would just say technical things

1932
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:27,119
that are completely wrong right

1933
01:01:24,079 --> 01:01:30,318
like one example of this that i

1934
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:33,599
remember is that he mixed up

1935
01:01:30,318 --> 01:01:35,679
the concept of 256 bits and 2 to the

1936
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:37,838
power of 256 bits

1937
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:39,118
right um so you know the difference is

1938
01:01:37,838 --> 01:01:41,119
it's like the difference between you

1939
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:41,680
know 80 and the concept of 80 digit

1940
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:44,720
numbers

1941
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:47,440
right um and because of this like he

1942
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:48,159
made this made this argument that said

1943
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:50,639
that

1944
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:52,558
bitcoin that bitcoin's elliptic curve is

1945
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:53,358
friendly to cryptographic pairings like

1946
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:55,200
you don't have to

1947
01:01:53,358 --> 01:01:56,558
understand what that is but if you want

1948
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:57,919
to know i have articles on both at

1949
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,480
vitalik.ca

1950
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:02,639
um but basically he made this like

1951
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:04,000
technical argument that really hedged on

1952
01:02:02,639 --> 01:02:05,679
this point and then when people when

1953
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:07,920
people pressed him on it's like

1954
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:09,679
yes what no no like what look exactly

1955
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,760
the the height is like what two and two

1956
01:02:09,679 --> 01:02:13,919
to the 256 bits that's uh

1957
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:17,200
a very uh a very tiny amount of

1958
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:17,680
information no no no 2256 bits is more

1959
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:19,358
than the

1960
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:21,440
amount of information in the universe

1961
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:22,239
and like yeah you know equivocated and

1962
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,559
kind of like

1963
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:26,078
preyed on people's inability to and you

1964
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:27,680
know understands that mathematical

1965
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,760
nuance and i called him out

1966
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:30,798
and eventually i even called him out in

1967
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:32,799
person at this

1968
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:33,838
conference and soul like i just stood up

1969
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:36,159
and asked

1970
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:37,759
the you know hey you know conference

1971
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:39,358
organizer why are you letting this fraud

1972
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:42,400
speak at this conference

1973
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:43,920
and i remember even some big blockers at

1974
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:46,960
the time getting angry at me

1975
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,639
um but you know eventually they i did

1976
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:50,159
get rid of him and then craig well

1977
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:53,118
basically craig wright

1978
01:02:50,159 --> 01:02:55,118
um was forced to split off because the

1979
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,720
rest of the community refused to accept

1980
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:58,960
some network change that he wanted

1981
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:00,879
and so then there was the bch and bsv

1982
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:02,480
and then in the bitcoin cash community

1983
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,720
there was this drama of

1984
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:06,159
are they going to add a developer fund

1985
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:07,519
where they redirect 12 and a half

1986
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:08,558
percent of the revenue from the miners

1987
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:10,400
to the devs

1988
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:12,079
and according to the libertarian not

1989
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,838
aggression principle is this technically

1990
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:17,359
theft

1991
01:03:13,838 --> 01:03:19,440
um like his um understanding of the

1992
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:21,679
technical depths of cryptocurrency

1993
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:23,200
was lacking in a way that you uh satoshi

1994
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:25,440
nakamoto certainly would not

1995
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,358
yes exactly but the point is that even

1996
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,280
after craig wright got expunged

1997
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:31,279
the bitcoin cash community kept having

1998
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:33,680
these disagreements right and now

1999
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,280
after this uh development funds dispute

2000
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,199
there's there's a further split between

2001
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:39,680
bitcoin cash and abc

2002
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:41,598
um so you know the the the brand check

2003
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:43,838
three continues to extend right

2004
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:45,119
so so in that way it's disappointing to

2005
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:46,798
see those kinds of splitting

2006
01:03:45,119 --> 01:03:48,318
there was never a result it is i would

2007
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:51,920
have definitely like

2008
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:55,038
wanted to see more of a kind of

2009
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:57,280
like v principled coin with a

2010
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:59,680
like tries to be bitcoin but but you

2011
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:02,079
know follows consistent big block values

2012
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:04,000
but yeah i know maybe i should just like

2013
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,200
stop expecting projects that i have no

2014
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:07,039
involvement and to

2015
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:08,399
uh care at all about what my values are

2016
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:10,839
and you know like maybe ethereum just

2017
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,880
like is

2018
01:04:10,838 --> 01:04:14,719
is never i think you have a powerful

2019
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,519
voice and you can inspire other projects

2020
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:17,838
to do

2021
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:18,960
to to to live up to their best possible

2022
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:22,159
cells

2023
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:25,599
okay so that's the level

2024
01:04:22,159 --> 01:04:28,000
that's the layer one uh approach

2025
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,838
the other layer one within the ethereum

2026
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:32,400
is the idea of sharding yes

2027
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:34,078
what the heck is sharding okay what does

2028
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:35,440
the future of shining look like right so

2029
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:37,359
to summarize that big

2030
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:38,880
long tangent that we just uh once it's a

2031
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:41,519
beautiful tangent button

2032
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:42,079
it's tangent and i think like crypto is

2033
01:04:41,519 --> 01:04:44,159
just

2034
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:46,079
uh one of the most underrated aspects of

2035
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:48,159
crypto is i think how you can

2036
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,920
like analyze the you know the sociology

2037
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:50,159
and the politics and the anthropology

2038
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,159
and

2039
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:54,000
yeah and i'm sure dan carl would have

2040
01:04:52,159 --> 01:04:56,159
fun exploring the space at some point

2041
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:57,920
but like the core trade-off right is

2042
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:59,838
that if you scale blockchains the dumb

2043
01:04:57,920 --> 01:05:01,358
way just by increasing the parameters

2044
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:03,119
then eventually you just make it harder

2045
01:05:01,358 --> 01:05:03,920
and harder to participate as a node and

2046
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,680
you

2047
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:07,838
end up with a system where there's like

2048
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:09,759
20 computers running the whole thing

2049
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:11,679
and it's just very centralized um so

2050
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,039
shorting basically says well

2051
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,480
instead of just increasing the

2052
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:16,240
parameters what we're going to do is

2053
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:17,358
we're going to change the blockchain

2054
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:20,639
architecture

2055
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:22,960
in such a way that each

2056
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:23,920
individual node in the blockchain only

2057
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,838
needs to store

2058
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,440
a small portion of the data and only

2059
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:28,719
needs to process a small portion of the

2060
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:30,159
transactions

2061
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:31,679
so you can think about it as being like

2062
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:33,440
inspired by bitsword right like on

2063
01:05:31,679 --> 01:05:34,960
bittorrent there's no such thing as a

2064
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,440
bittorrent full node that has every

2065
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,519
movie

2066
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,599
right you know the work is like split up

2067
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:41,440
among a huge number of computers and

2068
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,280
like that makes sense that's uh you know

2069
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:44,000
the only sane way to scale a system like

2070
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,798
that

2071
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,400
um and if they actually tried making a

2072
01:05:46,798 --> 01:05:49,119
version bit of bits or that required

2073
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,280
full nodes

2074
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:52,640
that store every movie then you know it

2075
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,160
would have like zero censorship

2076
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:57,440
resistance and it would just like

2077
01:05:54,159 --> 01:05:59,519
you know be dead in an instant uh so

2078
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:01,679
the challenge with taking that model and

2079
01:05:59,519 --> 01:06:03,358
applying it to blockchains right is that

2080
01:06:01,679 --> 01:06:05,838
blockchains aren't just about like

2081
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:08,159
spreading data around they're about

2082
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:09,920
agreeing on exactly what data was spread

2083
01:06:08,159 --> 01:06:11,679
around and ensuring that

2084
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:13,760
everything that you agree on actually is

2085
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:14,318
correct and so you have this paradox

2086
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:16,079
where

2087
01:06:14,318 --> 01:06:17,440
let's say you want to have a system that

2088
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,599
supports

2089
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:21,119
10 000 transactions a second but each

2090
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:23,200
computer in the network can only

2091
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,920
personally verify

2092
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:27,679
100 transactions a second so how can

2093
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,639
each computer

2094
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:32,239
get a guarantee about the other 900

2095
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:33,679
without actually going and verifying

2096
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:37,279
them themselves yep

2097
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:39,038
and it turns out that there are some um

2098
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,519
like a bundle of different tricks that

2099
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:43,599
can do that right so like one of them is

2100
01:06:41,519 --> 01:06:45,838
uh just random sampling

2101
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,798
so the idea behind random sampling is

2102
01:06:45,838 --> 01:06:48,558
like let's

2103
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,000
say for simplicity this is a proof of

2104
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:52,798
stake chain and

2105
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,199
you have 10 000 validators validators

2106
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:55,358
like

2107
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:56,719
you know the stakers and like for

2108
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:57,838
simplicity we'll assume they all have

2109
01:06:56,719 --> 01:06:59,199
the same number of coins right if

2110
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:00,400
someone has more coins we'll just kind

2111
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:01,598
of split them up and pretends they're

2112
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:05,200
tense takers

2113
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:06,720
then you you you do like some random

2114
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:08,318
shuffling and you basically say

2115
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:09,919
these random hundred validators are

2116
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:11,838
assigned to validate this

2117
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:12,960
block these random hundred validators

2118
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:14,318
are assigned to validate this block

2119
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:16,000
these random hundred validators are

2120
01:07:14,318 --> 01:07:18,798
assigned to validate this block

2121
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:20,639
and so each individual computer only

2122
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:21,280
gets assigned to validate like a small

2123
01:07:20,639 --> 01:07:23,440
piece

2124
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,880
but then the way that the information

2125
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:26,720
about like what's evaluated gets passed

2126
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:29,680
around right is that when

2127
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:30,480
these hundred participants validate a

2128
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,798
block

2129
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,519
they all sign a message basically saying

2130
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:35,280
like yes

2131
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:36,798
we agree that this block is valid and

2132
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:37,599
then like they combine that signature

2133
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:39,440
into one

2134
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,640
and then they broadcast that signature

2135
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,318
and then everyone else

2136
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:43,920
instead of verifying the blocks directly

2137
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:46,318
just verifies that signature

2138
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:48,400
right and so if i see the signature i'm

2139
01:07:46,318 --> 01:07:50,400
not directly convinced that that block

2140
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:51,200
is valid but what i am convinced of is

2141
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,599
that

2142
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:54,960
out of this committee of or this

2143
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,480
randomly selected group of 100

2144
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,480
validators let's say

2145
01:07:56,480 --> 01:08:01,119
at least 70 of them agree that this

2146
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,639
block is valid and so if i trust that

2147
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:04,160
you know the majority of these

2148
01:08:02,639 --> 01:08:06,078
participants are all honest

2149
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:07,519
then because it's all randomly selected

2150
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,200
you know the attacker can't just like

2151
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:11,280
force themselves into one committee

2152
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:12,558
and and so you know the attacker is

2153
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,680
going to be even at least

2154
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:17,359
evenly spread out too and so if you know

2155
01:08:15,679 --> 01:08:18,559
the entire set of validators is mostly

2156
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:20,000
honest every committee is going to be

2157
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,359
mostly honest and so

2158
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:23,119
like bad blocks are not going to go

2159
01:08:21,359 --> 01:08:25,279
through right so that's like

2160
01:08:23,119 --> 01:08:26,880
one simple form of sharding there's also

2161
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,799
other more clever things that you can do

2162
01:08:26,880 --> 01:08:30,560
so for example there's this concept of

2163
01:08:28,798 --> 01:08:32,479
zk snarks right now called as your

2164
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,400
knowledge proofs so this is the idea

2165
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:35,519
that you can make a cryptographic proof

2166
01:08:34,399 --> 01:08:39,278
that says

2167
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:41,359
i verified or i ran

2168
01:08:39,279 --> 01:08:43,279
some complex computation on this piece

2169
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:45,679
of data and i got this answer

2170
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:47,679
and so if you make these kinds of proofs

2171
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:49,039
then like if you see a zika snark that

2172
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:50,798
says some block is valid

2173
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:52,640
then you're convinced that that block is

2174
01:08:50,798 --> 01:08:54,319
valid and

2175
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,400
even if you know everyone in that

2176
01:08:54,319 --> 01:08:58,640
committee is evil like they have no way

2177
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,198
of making a a valid proof for a bad

2178
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,119
block

2179
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:02,559
right like because the proof itself like

2180
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:03,519
it is a proof that you did the

2181
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:05,039
computation

2182
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:06,560
where that proof is much easier to

2183
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:08,798
verify than

2184
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,839
just running the computation yourself

2185
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:12,238
and you know

2186
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:13,600
the there's once again you know super

2187
01:09:12,238 --> 01:09:15,759
awesome

2188
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:17,359
mathematical cryptographic magic behind

2189
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:19,838
making zk snarks work

2190
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:21,679
um so it gives you a little bit of a leg

2191
01:09:19,838 --> 01:09:23,920
up over the 51

2192
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,520
honest exact assumption so it's a little

2193
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:26,399
hack that improves upon the random

2194
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,080
sampling thing

2195
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,920
exactly and like there's other hacks

2196
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:31,679
right like there is another hack called

2197
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,960
data availability sampling that allows

2198
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,039
you to make sure that the data in the

2199
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,600
blocks was actually published

2200
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:39,039
but like basically like if you stack a

2201
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,520
couple of these tricks on top of each

2202
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:41,600
other

2203
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:43,120
you can create a system where like i as

2204
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:45,279
an individual participant

2205
01:09:43,119 --> 01:09:47,039
can be convinced that everything that's

2206
01:09:45,279 --> 01:09:48,799
going on in this distributed blockchain

2207
01:09:47,039 --> 01:09:50,238
thing is correct without actually

2208
01:09:48,798 --> 01:09:50,960
personally checking more than like a

2209
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:52,879
percent of it

2210
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,319
so that's charting that's starting but

2211
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:58,079
but the

2212
01:09:54,319 --> 01:10:01,599
as i understand maybe correct me on this

2213
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:04,079
is uh in the space of ethereum

2214
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:05,360
the the sharding happens on some fixed

2215
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:07,519
number

2216
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:09,198
like th the split is on some fixed

2217
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:11,440
number i think it's 64.

2218
01:10:09,198 --> 01:10:12,479
is the currently sort of proposed number

2219
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:16,158
so

2220
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:16,799
um how does that help scaling is it just

2221
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:19,679
to fix

2222
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,719
constant scaling by 64 and is that a way

2223
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,199
to achieve those

2224
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:25,119
crazy the crazy amount of scaling that

2225
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:27,678
seems to be required

2226
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:29,519
to use cryptocurrency for uh for

2227
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,399
purchasing so doing like competing with

2228
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,400
credit cards

2229
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:34,639
and visa and so on right so first i

2230
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:35,439
think like the 64 can be hard forked up

2231
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:38,079
over time

2232
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:39,279
um so we have uh set it so that like

2233
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:41,760
there's theoretically

2234
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:43,439
space in the data structure for 1024

2235
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,320
shards it's just that 64 of them are

2236
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:46,559
turned on

2237
01:10:44,319 --> 01:10:48,000
um like there are challenges with having

2238
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,520
more shards because like you have to

2239
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,399
have logic that just like checks and

2240
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:52,239
manages all

2241
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:54,238
of those shards and if there's too many

2242
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:56,319
of them then that becomes too expensive

2243
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:57,519
um but you know even still you can

2244
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:59,039
improve quite a bit

2245
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,640
and then the other thing that we're

2246
01:10:59,039 --> 01:11:02,880
doing is if

2247
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,760
what we're getting maximum scalability

2248
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,000
by combining

2249
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:07,199
roll-ups and sharding right so this

2250
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,760
might be a good time to talk about

2251
01:11:07,198 --> 01:11:09,678
roll-ups

2252
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,400
what are roll-ups okay and now we're

2253
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:16,079
moving into layer two ideas yes

2254
01:11:12,399 --> 01:11:19,439
so the idea behind a roll-up

2255
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:23,119
is basically that so

2256
01:11:19,439 --> 01:11:25,198
instead of um just publishing

2257
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:27,840
transactions directly on chain

2258
01:11:25,198 --> 01:11:29,599
and having everyone you know do all of

2259
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,920
the checking of those transactions

2260
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:33,199
and what you do is you create a system

2261
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,239
where

2262
01:11:33,198 --> 01:11:36,799
users send their transactions to some

2263
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:38,799
part like

2264
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,560
central party called an aggregator and

2265
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,679
like well theoretically you can have a

2266
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:43,440
system where like the aggregator

2267
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:44,399
switches around or anyone can be an

2268
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:46,079
aggregator so

2269
01:11:44,399 --> 01:11:47,519
you know it's still like permissionless

2270
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:50,319
to send things um

2271
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:52,800
then what the aggregator does is they

2272
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:56,158
strip out all of the transaction data

2273
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:56,640
that like is not relevant to helping

2274
01:11:56,158 --> 01:11:58,559
people

2275
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,079
update the state so when i say the state

2276
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,679
this is like this is a very important

2277
01:12:00,079 --> 01:12:02,399
kind of technical term for blockchains i

2278
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:06,158
mean like

2279
01:12:02,399 --> 01:12:08,639
account balances code um

2280
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:10,479
like things that are like memory

2281
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:12,000
internal memory of smart contracts like

2282
01:12:10,479 --> 01:12:13,198
basically everything the blockchain

2283
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:15,840
actually has to keep track of and

2284
01:12:13,198 --> 01:12:18,879
remember right so

2285
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,480
you just put in

2286
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,119
you take all these transactions strip

2287
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:24,799
out all the data that's not relevant to

2288
01:12:23,119 --> 01:12:26,559
telling people how to update the state

2289
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,840
and then you take the data that's needed

2290
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,360
to update the state and then you like

2291
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:30,480
really compress it right so like for

2292
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:33,119
example

2293
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,599
if we say you know i vitalik have an

2294
01:12:33,119 --> 01:12:36,479
account

2295
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,600
that's 0x eight blah blah blah blah and

2296
01:12:36,479 --> 01:12:39,439
it's 20 bytes

2297
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,880
well instead we can say well i have an

2298
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:43,359
account that is

2299
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:44,159
number one eight seven four two two four

2300
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,238
in the tree

2301
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:47,920
right and that goes down from 20 bytes

2302
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:49,519
to just like an index and a position

2303
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:51,039
which is three bytes right so you use

2304
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,120
all sorts of these fancy compression

2305
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:54,640
tracks then you basically just

2306
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:56,800
instead of publishing all these

2307
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:58,000
transactions you publish this like tiny

2308
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,920
compressed blob

2309
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:01,600
right so the amount of data that goes on

2310
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,399
chain goes down by maybe about a factor

2311
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,079
of ten

2312
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:06,079
right and then the second thing is that

2313
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:08,479
you don't do the computation on chin

2314
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:09,359
instead you do the computation off-chain

2315
01:13:08,479 --> 01:13:11,119
and

2316
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:13,198
there's one of two ways to do this right

2317
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:15,039
one is called a zk roll up which is

2318
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:16,399
you just provide a zika snark that

2319
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:19,198
basically says hey look

2320
01:13:16,399 --> 01:13:20,399
i did this computation and uh and i have

2321
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:21,839
this proof that here's the

2322
01:13:20,399 --> 01:13:23,759
here's the you know some hash of the

2323
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,719
result and it's correct and then you

2324
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:26,640
stick it on chain

2325
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:27,840
and everyone verifies this one proof

2326
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:29,039
instead of verifying all these

2327
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:30,640
transactions

2328
01:13:29,039 --> 01:13:32,399
and then the other approach is called an

2329
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,280
optimistic roll-up which is basically

2330
01:13:32,399 --> 01:13:36,799
made of the scheme where like first

2331
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:38,399
someone says like hey

2332
01:13:36,800 --> 01:13:40,719
this is what i think the result of the

2333
01:13:38,399 --> 01:13:42,479
of applying these transactions is and

2334
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:43,600
then someone else can say i disagree the

2335
01:13:42,479 --> 01:13:45,919
result is different

2336
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:47,120
and only if two people disagree do you

2337
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,440
actually do it on like

2338
01:13:47,119 --> 01:13:50,800
do you actually just like publish all of

2339
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:52,879
the data and run the whole

2340
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:54,239
that whole blog on chain so if there's

2341
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:56,560
disagreements then you just

2342
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:58,399
like run everything on chain and whoever

2343
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:00,320
was wrong like loses a lot of money

2344
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:01,519
right so disagreements are very rare and

2345
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:03,439
they're very expensive

2346
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,560
and in a ck roll up you don't even rely

2347
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:07,119
on this like challenging

2348
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:09,199
game at all you just rely on a proof so

2349
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:09,679
you know the core principle is basically

2350
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:12,319
that

2351
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:13,760
instead of lots of transactions and all

2352
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:14,639
the trends that everyone verifies every

2353
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:16,880
transaction

2354
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:18,960
it is you take the transactions you

2355
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,239
strip strip them down and compress them

2356
01:14:18,960 --> 01:14:22,640
as much as possible

2357
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:23,839
then stick that on the blockchain you do

2358
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:25,600
need to stick something on the

2359
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,199
blockchain just so that everyone

2360
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,640
everyone else can like keep keep up to

2361
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:30,079
date with the states so they know

2362
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,679
you know what all the contracts are what

2363
01:14:30,079 --> 01:14:33,600
all the balances are and all of this but

2364
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:35,359
it's a very small amount of data and

2365
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,520
then you use some one of these other

2366
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:39,839
off-chain games you know could be this

2367
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:41,199
optimistic game could be a zk-snark to

2368
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,960
just prove that

2369
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:44,238
somebody out there did the compensation

2370
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:46,880
and the result is correct

2371
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:48,238
right so you're pushing like 90 of the

2372
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:51,279
work off chain and then

2373
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:52,639
you know well 90 of the data ends 99 of

2374
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:54,238
the computation option

2375
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:56,159
and then you still have 10 of the data

2376
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:57,839
and 1 of the computation on chin

2377
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,920
and so you know your scalability goes up

2378
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:03,679
by a factor of about a hundred

2379
01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:06,158
so these systems are already alive for

2380
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:07,840
for some applications right so there's

2381
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:08,479
something called loopering which is just

2382
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:11,279
a

2383
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:11,919
zk roll up for payments right so you can

2384
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:13,920
have

2385
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,199
you know assets inside of us inside of

2386
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:17,359
the loopering system

2387
01:15:15,198 --> 01:15:18,719
and you can go around and transfer them

2388
01:15:17,359 --> 01:15:21,759
but

2389
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:24,239
uh what you um and

2390
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,760
you get like much lower transaction fees

2391
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:27,678
right like instead of five dollars you'd

2392
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,719
have to pay like less than five cents

2393
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:32,480
um but the only problem is that this

2394
01:15:30,719 --> 01:15:34,480
only supports a couple of applications

2395
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,000
right now like making one that

2396
01:15:34,479 --> 01:15:38,639
supports anything that you can do on

2397
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,238
ethereum just takes a bit more work but

2398
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:42,000
that's being done as well right so like

2399
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:45,119
within a few months i'm expecting

2400
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:48,640
you know fully ethereum um capable

2401
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:51,519
um roll ups to um be available as well

2402
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:53,199
so then so roll ups just summarizing you

2403
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,400
know do most of the work off chain put

2404
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:56,639
only a little bit on chain

2405
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:58,639
factor of 100 scaling sharding another

2406
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,000
factor of 100 scaling 100 times 100

2407
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,199
factor of 10 000

2408
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,800
you know hundreds of thousands of

2409
01:16:01,198 --> 01:16:04,079
transactions a second and like you know

2410
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,760
there's your scalability

2411
01:16:04,079 --> 01:16:07,600
okay so you choose scalability you can

2412
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,600
do a large number of transactions very

2413
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,440
quickly and uh the cost of doing those

2414
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:15,280
transactions much lower

2415
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:16,559
you wrote that uh in the long term zka

2416
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:18,559
roll-ups are going to win

2417
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,239
in terms of layer 2 technology

2418
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,960
specifically you wrote

2419
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:24,799
in general my own view is that the in

2420
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:25,679
the short term optimistic roll ups as

2421
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,679
you were saying

2422
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:29,359
are likely to win out of general purpose

2423
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:32,399
evm computation and

2424
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:35,679
zk roll ups are likely to win

2425
01:16:32,399 --> 01:16:37,679
out for simple payments uh exchange in

2426
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:39,600
other application specific use cases

2427
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:42,319
just as you were saying but in the

2428
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:45,760
medium to long term zk roll ups will win

2429
01:16:42,319 --> 01:16:49,039
out in all use cases as

2430
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:51,840
zk snark technology improves

2431
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:53,039
why do you think uh zk roll ups are

2432
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:55,039
going to win

2433
01:16:53,039 --> 01:16:56,800
the big picture battle over layer 2

2434
01:16:55,039 --> 01:16:59,760
technologies

2435
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:02,159
so i think zk roll ups like once you

2436
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:04,079
accept that the technology works are

2437
01:17:02,158 --> 01:17:05,439
just like conceptually simpler and they

2438
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:07,519
have nicer properties

2439
01:17:05,439 --> 01:17:09,119
the reason is that they do not have this

2440
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,840
concept of a challenge game right like

2441
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:11,760
as i mentioned

2442
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,039
in an optimistic roll-up the way that

2443
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:14,960
you ensure that

2444
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:16,560
the results are correct is that you let

2445
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:17,920
one person submit and like they just

2446
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,679
submit with no proof they just say

2447
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:21,840
here's what i think the result is

2448
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,279
and then if someone else disagrees they

2449
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:24,640
make their own submission and then if

2450
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:26,000
you have two disagreeing submissions

2451
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,440
then you actually publish it on chain

2452
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,840
and you see who's right

2453
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:31,839
but for this to work like you need to

2454
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:33,679
actually wait for someone to disagree

2455
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,520
right so like for example if i have an

2456
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:37,199
asset inside of an optimistic roll-up

2457
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:38,800
and i wants to withdraw it then i

2458
01:17:37,198 --> 01:17:39,599
actually have to wait a week to withdraw

2459
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:42,719
it because

2460
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,560
like if the uh a block that contains my

2461
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:46,000
withdrawal turns out to be invalid then

2462
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:46,880
there needs to be space for someone to

2463
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,800
disagree with it

2464
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,239
right whereas with a ck roll up like you

2465
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:51,679
don't need time for disagreement because

2466
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:53,519
you just have a proof right as soon as

2467
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:56,000
the block is submitted there's a proof

2468
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:56,880
and you know it's correct so

2469
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:59,279
disagreements

2470
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:00,000
especially in the long term or sparse uh

2471
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:02,319
then uh

2472
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:03,039
then then you don't want to do the

2473
01:18:02,319 --> 01:18:04,559
optimistic

2474
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:06,319
the the game theoretic thing you know

2475
01:18:04,560 --> 01:18:06,719
you want to do the zk stock right the z

2476
01:18:06,319 --> 01:18:09,519
case

2477
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:11,198
stuff is just like you can in a ck roll

2478
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,679
up you can withdraw immediately

2479
01:18:11,198 --> 01:18:15,839
um you don't have to like worry about

2480
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:18,399
the economics of proving as much

2481
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:20,560
there's just like fewer issues um the

2482
01:18:18,399 --> 01:18:22,559
reason why ck roll-ups are not winning

2483
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,159
everywhere today is because you know

2484
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:25,840
zeke's darks is still a crazy new

2485
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,399
technology right like this is something

2486
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:28,800
that

2487
01:18:26,399 --> 01:18:30,719
10 years ago you know it existed only in

2488
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:33,039
theory and there was none in practice

2489
01:18:30,719 --> 01:18:34,480
um then you know eight years ago people

2490
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:36,640
were just getting excited about it in

2491
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:40,158
bitcoin conferences for the first time

2492
01:18:36,640 --> 01:18:40,640
um like four years starting four years

2493
01:18:40,158 --> 01:18:42,399
ago

2494
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,840
or three and a half years ago even that

2495
01:18:42,399 --> 01:18:46,000
was the first time you were able to make

2496
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,719
any zika snark based anything on

2497
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,198
ethereum

2498
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:51,198
and then people started making them and

2499
01:18:49,198 --> 01:18:52,879
zk technology has only really become

2500
01:18:51,198 --> 01:18:54,000
efficient enough to do a lot of things

2501
01:18:52,880 --> 01:18:57,920
within the past maybe

2502
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:59,679
one and a half years so it's

2503
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,679
it's new technology it's crazy

2504
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:02,800
technology it's admittedly scary

2505
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:04,399
technology

2506
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:06,239
if you want to learn more i also have an

2507
01:19:04,399 --> 01:19:09,279
article about this on vitality.ca

2508
01:19:06,238 --> 01:19:12,158
it's actually really really good

2509
01:19:09,279 --> 01:19:12,479
most of your writing uh it's it goes

2510
01:19:12,158 --> 01:19:14,639
it's

2511
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:15,599
technical but it's accessible i highly

2512
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,360
highly recommend

2513
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:19,360
to check out vitalik's articles and

2514
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:22,559
blogs whatever whatever you call them

2515
01:19:19,359 --> 01:19:24,559
yeah it's brilliant summary of the work

2516
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:26,239
actually uh ethereum documentation

2517
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:29,120
period is really good i think that's

2518
01:19:26,238 --> 01:19:30,399
somewhat crowdsourced that documentation

2519
01:19:29,119 --> 01:19:31,599
is really really accessible and

2520
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:35,198
brilliant

2521
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:38,239
uh but let me ask about sort of

2522
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:40,559
other approaches to layer two

2523
01:19:38,238 --> 01:19:42,319
like side chains so the one popular one

2524
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:43,840
is polygon

2525
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:46,880
what are your thoughts about polygon

2526
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:50,319
which is a layer two

2527
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:52,400
network is it positive is it negative

2528
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:53,198
for ethereum is it both does it have a

2529
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:57,359
future

2530
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:59,919
which is its own chain but it's using

2531
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:00,799
a theory it's like based on ethereum

2532
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:02,800
essentially

2533
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:05,279
or maybe you can describe what it is um

2534
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:07,119
so i think there is a really big and

2535
01:20:05,279 --> 01:20:08,880
important difference in security models

2536
01:20:07,119 --> 01:20:11,519
between roll-ups and side-chains

2537
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:13,359
which is basically that roll-ups inherit

2538
01:20:11,520 --> 01:20:14,320
from the security of ethereum right so

2539
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:16,559
like if

2540
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:19,359
i have coins inside of bloopering or

2541
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:22,400
optimism or arbitrarium um or zk sync

2542
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:23,920
um then even if everyone else in the

2543
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:25,920
world who is participating in these

2544
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:28,239
ecosystems so like hates me and though

2545
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:29,440
and wants to steal my money i can still

2546
01:20:28,238 --> 01:20:31,119
personally

2547
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:33,439
make sure that you know no matter what

2548
01:20:31,119 --> 01:20:34,719
happens i get them i get my money out

2549
01:20:33,439 --> 01:20:36,079
it might be a bit expensive for me to

2550
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:38,158
get my money out and i have to do

2551
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:41,279
transactions like on the main chain but

2552
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,960
i'll be able to do it whereas in polygon

2553
01:20:41,279 --> 01:20:44,158
which is a side chain and so instead of

2554
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,800
being secured by

2555
01:20:44,158 --> 01:20:47,599
ethereum it's also in part secured by

2556
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:49,360
its own

2557
01:20:47,600 --> 01:20:50,639
um a proof of state consensus with its

2558
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:54,559
own token so

2559
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:56,800
if 70 of the whole or even 51

2560
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:58,719
of the holders of polygon tokens wanted

2561
01:20:56,800 --> 01:21:02,000
to take my money in polygon they can

2562
01:20:58,719 --> 01:21:04,000
right so that's the pro

2563
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:05,679
and like to be fair like there aren't

2564
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:07,359
even like the

2565
01:21:05,679 --> 01:21:08,880
the supply i don't think is even that

2566
01:21:07,359 --> 01:21:09,839
widely distributed right so like

2567
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,039
potentially

2568
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:15,199
you could you could this idea 51

2569
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:17,519
of the token holders coming together and

2570
01:21:15,198 --> 01:21:19,678
stealing everything like it's

2571
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,760
it's not impossible right uh where does

2572
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:23,440
the scaling of polygon come from like

2573
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:26,159
why is it

2574
01:21:23,439 --> 01:21:26,559
able to process much more transactions

2575
01:21:26,158 --> 01:21:28,879
than

2576
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,000
the ethereum main chain what's the idea

2577
01:21:28,880 --> 01:21:32,800
there i think

2578
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:34,560
in part like i imagine i'm not sure

2579
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,639
exactly what its capacity level is but

2580
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,440
like i imagine it has a higher capacity

2581
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:38,880
because

2582
01:21:37,439 --> 01:21:40,559
it's a bit more willing to take

2583
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:43,279
centralization trade-offs

2584
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,800
and then another thing is that like if

2585
01:21:43,279 --> 01:21:46,559
the ethereum ecosystem

2586
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:48,000
like even if it did not do that right if

2587
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:49,840
you think about an ethereum ecosystem

2588
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,238
hypothetically scaling with side chains

2589
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,600
then

2590
01:21:50,238 --> 01:21:53,359
you know you would have 100 copies of

2591
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,480
polygon and you know they would each

2592
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:55,519
have their own tokens they would each

2593
01:21:54,479 --> 01:21:57,519
have their own chins

2594
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:59,600
and so even if each one of those chains

2595
01:21:57,520 --> 01:22:01,920
was only as scalable as ethereum

2596
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:03,679
you know you know you could still like

2597
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:05,039
the total sum of them would still be 100

2598
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:08,319
times more than ethereum

2599
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:10,800
okay um the now the thing that i want to

2600
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:13,920
say in polygons favor just to be very

2601
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:15,920
fair to them like i i i really you know

2602
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:17,359
i i definitely really you know respect

2603
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,119
the work that they're doing so you know

2604
01:22:17,359 --> 01:22:22,880
start with the um

2605
01:22:19,119 --> 01:22:24,158
a bit with that word of uh not criticism

2606
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:27,440
caution right like it's

2607
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:29,439
um that they made this

2608
01:22:27,439 --> 01:22:31,119
kind of deliberate trade-off for very

2609
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:32,719
pragmatic reasons which is that

2610
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:34,399
the ethereum ecosystem needs to scale

2611
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:35,840
now and there are applications that want

2612
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:38,158
to do something now

2613
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:39,679
and you know if there aren't ethereum

2614
01:22:38,158 --> 01:22:40,799
friendly options for them then

2615
01:22:39,679 --> 01:22:42,560
like they're not going to just wait

2616
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:44,159
peacefully and do nothing for 12 months

2617
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,960
you know they're going to go to

2618
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:47,439
you know either binance smart chain or

2619
01:22:46,960 --> 01:22:50,639
you know

2620
01:22:47,439 --> 01:22:51,678
one of some other system or potentially

2621
01:22:50,639 --> 01:22:53,359
something that just has

2622
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,719
totally no alignment with ethereum

2623
01:22:53,359 --> 01:22:57,439
values whatsoever

2624
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:58,399
um but whereas you know with paul with

2625
01:22:57,439 --> 01:22:59,678
polygon like

2626
01:22:58,399 --> 01:23:02,158
the best thing that you can say in

2627
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:03,760
polygons favor and against optimism is

2628
01:23:02,158 --> 01:23:04,879
that you know optimism is not live and

2629
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,520
polygonal is life

2630
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:09,119
right like it just takes more work to

2631
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:11,440
create a system that has

2632
01:23:09,119 --> 01:23:12,238
these extra roll-ups uh security

2633
01:23:11,439 --> 01:23:14,319
features

2634
01:23:12,238 --> 01:23:15,759
and so polygon just said we're gonna be

2635
01:23:14,319 --> 01:23:18,000
the system that makes the pragmatic

2636
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:20,320
tradeoff we're gonna go

2637
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:21,679
you know functionality first and then

2638
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:22,880
you know we can talk about adding back

2639
01:23:21,679 --> 01:23:24,480
the security later

2640
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:25,920
so i've talked to them and like in

2641
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:28,718
principle i think

2642
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,920
they're very you know open to the idea

2643
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:32,880
of like adding more

2644
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:33,359
more security and at least becoming more

2645
01:23:32,880 --> 01:23:36,000
uh

2646
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:36,479
becoming a roll up or at least you know

2647
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,479
adding

2648
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:39,678
a polygon chain let's say roll up at

2649
01:23:38,479 --> 01:23:41,198
some point in the future

2650
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:42,880
which is definitely something i think

2651
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:44,000
they yeah you know absolutely should

2652
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,359
follow through one

2653
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:49,520
but like the fact that like they exist

2654
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:50,880
now and so you know applications can

2655
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:52,480
kind of bootstrap now

2656
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,000
on a chain that you know even though

2657
01:23:52,479 --> 01:23:55,759
it's security isn't perfect at least it

2658
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,560
exists and people can go use it um and

2659
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,800
then

2660
01:23:56,560 --> 01:24:00,880
over time you know the chain matures as

2661
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:03,199
the applications mature like units

2662
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,319
i think of a very reasonable strategy

2663
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:05,279
and i'm definitely

2664
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:07,920
really happy that they're part of the

2665
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:09,840
ecosystem

2666
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:11,440
yeah it's kind of interesting the

2667
01:24:09,840 --> 01:24:15,440
history of cryptocurrency

2668
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:17,678
has this um tension of really good ideas

2669
01:24:15,439 --> 01:24:19,359
that are hard to implement so they take

2670
01:24:17,679 --> 01:24:22,480
longer to implement

2671
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:24,000
and ideas that are not as good but are

2672
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:25,279
faster to implement this is like the

2673
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:26,960
story of like

2674
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:28,319
you have like javascript that basically

2675
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:30,158
took over the world

2676
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:31,519
because it was quick to implement within

2677
01:24:30,158 --> 01:24:34,960
10 days

2678
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:38,000
and then like later kept fixing itself

2679
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:40,158
i i don't know what to make of that sort

2680
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:42,319
of from an engineering perspective

2681
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,000
i'm more and more becoming comfortable

2682
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:46,639
and accepting the fact that our whole

2683
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:48,719
world will run a technology that's not

2684
01:24:46,639 --> 01:24:51,039
as good as it could have been

2685
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:53,039
just because the crappy solution is

2686
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:55,600
faster to implement and it sticks

2687
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:56,158
what do you make of that tension i think

2688
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,079
the

2689
01:24:56,158 --> 01:24:59,359
compromise that we've been taking within

2690
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:01,039
ethereum is

2691
01:24:59,359 --> 01:25:03,439
like when we have to take the crappy

2692
01:25:01,039 --> 01:25:05,039
solution we look for crappy solutions

2693
01:25:03,439 --> 01:25:06,719
that are forward compatible with

2694
01:25:05,039 --> 01:25:09,039
becoming good over time

2695
01:25:06,719 --> 01:25:10,399
right like when you build the the quick

2696
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:12,560
and dirty thing like you

2697
01:25:10,399 --> 01:25:13,439
you would still already have ideas in

2698
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:15,280
your head about

2699
01:25:13,439 --> 01:25:16,799
you know what the the more complete

2700
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:18,479
thing with all the security features

2701
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,159
added on would look like right even if

2702
01:25:18,479 --> 01:25:23,198
it requires a hard fork

2703
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:24,799
um yes like even so you know like for

2704
01:25:23,198 --> 01:25:25,678
example we're sharding right like well

2705
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:27,760
yeah i think

2706
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:29,199
it's likely that the first version of

2707
01:25:27,760 --> 01:25:30,719
chardonnay that comes out like is not

2708
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:32,719
going to have you know zk snarks and

2709
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:34,800
data availability sampling for example

2710
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:36,239
but we know what these technologies are

2711
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:37,520
we feel like we

2712
01:25:36,238 --> 01:25:39,839
you know have wrapped our heads around

2713
01:25:37,520 --> 01:25:40,639
them and so we know how to build a

2714
01:25:39,840 --> 01:25:42,480
system

2715
01:25:40,639 --> 01:25:44,239
where we can put all the pieces in place

2716
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:46,158
so that it becomes very easy to bolt

2717
01:25:44,238 --> 01:25:48,638
those components on in the future

2718
01:25:46,158 --> 01:25:49,359
uh so like if you do things that way

2719
01:25:48,639 --> 01:25:51,199
right then

2720
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:53,198
at the beginning you can have your

2721
01:25:51,198 --> 01:25:55,759
system that has the functionality but

2722
01:25:53,198 --> 01:25:58,079
say has less security or like less

2723
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:01,679
sustainability or less of something else

2724
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:03,519
but then over time like it's designed in

2725
01:26:01,679 --> 01:26:05,199
such a way that it has this easy on

2726
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:06,960
on-ramp to adding those things

2727
01:26:05,198 --> 01:26:09,039
right and if you don't think explicitly

2728
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,760
about like being future compatible then

2729
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:13,279
you do often end up with a a quick and

2730
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:13,920
dirty solution that backs you into a

2731
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:15,840
corner

2732
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,960
and then there are definitely cases

2733
01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:18,480
where like i think the ethereum

2734
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,359
ecosystem has suffered from that and we

2735
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:22,879
have had to

2736
01:26:19,359 --> 01:26:25,759
like expand pretty significant effort

2737
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:26,800
on for example removing features that we

2738
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:30,000
didn't realize

2739
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:32,079
that we actually can't sustain like one

2740
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:34,079
big example is just increasing the yeah

2741
01:26:32,079 --> 01:26:36,479
the gas costs so like making some

2742
01:26:34,079 --> 01:26:37,760
operations more expensive when they uh

2743
01:26:36,479 --> 01:26:39,039
because they should be expensive because

2744
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,760
they actually take a lot of time in the

2745
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:42,880
process

2746
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:44,480
and um so that's you know making a thing

2747
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:46,319
some things more expensive kind of like

2748
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:49,919
taking some functionality away

2749
01:26:46,319 --> 01:26:50,479
um so if you can like be cognizant of

2750
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,158
where

2751
01:26:50,479 --> 01:26:53,919
you're likely going into the future and

2752
01:26:52,158 --> 01:26:55,359
if you don't know like even be cognizant

2753
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,639
of both the most likely paths that

2754
01:26:55,359 --> 01:26:58,960
you'll take in the future

2755
01:26:56,639 --> 01:27:00,880
and coming like thinking about your road

2756
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,439
map and coming up with a road map where

2757
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:04,800
you know that like if you wants to do

2758
01:27:03,439 --> 01:27:06,479
either of those things then you have a

2759
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:08,320
clean path toward it

2760
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:09,919
that's probably the best kind of

2761
01:27:08,319 --> 01:27:11,920
practical way to get the best of both

2762
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:14,880
worlds that we have

2763
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,840
okay let's talk about this uh wonderful

2764
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:19,039
process of

2765
01:27:16,840 --> 01:27:22,159
merging

2766
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:25,359
okay so there's the main net

2767
01:27:22,158 --> 01:27:26,638
which is the ethereum 1.0 chain or the

2768
01:27:25,359 --> 01:27:28,319
ch

2769
01:27:26,639 --> 01:27:30,880
what should we say the chain that uses

2770
01:27:28,319 --> 01:27:33,439
proof of work as a consensus mechanism

2771
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:35,440
and then there is uh what is it called

2772
01:27:33,439 --> 01:27:38,479
the the beacon chain

2773
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:41,759
that uses the uh the

2774
01:27:38,479 --> 01:27:43,198
proof of stake mechanism and i believe

2775
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,600
the

2776
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:46,559
beacon has been deployed successfully is

2777
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:49,199
is working

2778
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,560
so that was in december 2020 there's a

2779
01:27:49,198 --> 01:27:52,158
bunch of questions around that that's

2780
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:54,560
fascinating as well but

2781
01:27:52,158 --> 01:27:55,839
i think the most fascinating question is

2782
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:59,520
um

2783
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:03,279
it's about merging those two when do

2784
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:04,800
the two chains one that's proof of work

2785
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:08,000
one that's proof of stake

2786
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:11,360
merge and what are the most difficult

2787
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:13,600
parts of this process right so i guess

2788
01:28:11,359 --> 01:28:15,839
you've said right the way that we if i

2789
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:17,120
set up this proof of stake transition is

2790
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:18,800
that at first

2791
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:20,238
the proof of stake chain just launches

2792
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,960
on its own right and this is the thing

2793
01:28:20,238 --> 01:28:23,678
that happened

2794
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:24,560
in december and the proof of stake chain

2795
01:28:23,679 --> 01:28:27,679
has been

2796
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:30,000
running for close to six months uh

2797
01:28:27,679 --> 01:28:31,920
now um i mean by the time people watch

2798
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,800
this it might actually be six months

2799
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:36,800
um and but it isn't actually coming to

2800
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:37,440
consensus on anything except for itself

2801
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:40,320
right

2802
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:42,399
so the idea behind that is to just give

2803
01:28:40,319 --> 01:28:44,399
the proof of stake chain time

2804
01:28:42,399 --> 01:28:46,000
to mature time for people to build the

2805
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:47,519
ecosystem around it time to make sure

2806
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:49,520
that there aren't any bugs

2807
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:51,120
um and just like prove to the community

2808
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,560
that you know proof of stake actually is

2809
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:55,519
real and it's

2810
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:56,560
and a full transition is realistic

2811
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:57,520
because you know the thing that you're

2812
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:59,440
transitioning to

2813
01:28:57,520 --> 01:29:01,040
already exists and already works and

2814
01:28:59,439 --> 01:29:02,960
then at some point in the future

2815
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:04,800
you have this event called the merge

2816
01:29:02,960 --> 01:29:06,560
where you basically

2817
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,920
take the activity that's being done

2818
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,440
inside of the proof of work chain

2819
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:10,960
and you actually move it over into the

2820
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:12,960
proof of stake chain so you get rid of

2821
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,719
the proof of work side completely

2822
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:20,319
uh so the way that the merge

2823
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:22,480
will work is um and it's definitely gone

2824
01:29:20,319 --> 01:29:24,799
through a few different iterations like

2825
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:26,638
the the earlier versions of this

2826
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:28,239
actually required more work for users

2827
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:29,039
and more work for clients it was much

2828
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,399
more like

2829
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:32,079
oh there's this new chain there's this

2830
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:33,759
old chain and then

2831
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:35,279
everyone has to like migrate from the

2832
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:36,639
old chain to the new chain and then at

2833
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:37,279
some point we'll forget about the old

2834
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:40,480
chin

2835
01:29:37,279 --> 01:29:43,599
the new version is designed to be

2836
01:29:40,479 --> 01:29:45,119
much more seamless for users right so

2837
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:48,639
basically what actually happens

2838
01:29:45,119 --> 01:29:49,279
is that the old chain basically becomes

2839
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:51,760
embedded

2840
01:29:49,279 --> 01:29:54,559
inside the new chain right so at

2841
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:56,960
starting from the merge transition block

2842
01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:59,199
every proof of stake chain block is

2843
01:29:56,960 --> 01:30:01,679
going to contain a block of

2844
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:03,519
the what what we consider now to what we

2845
01:30:01,679 --> 01:30:05,600
consider to be the ethereum chain today

2846
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,120
but we'll call it the execution chain

2847
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,639
and then at the same time

2848
01:30:07,119 --> 01:30:10,238
to create one of these blocks you're not

2849
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,319
going to need proof of work anymore

2850
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:14,319
right so basically at the same time you

2851
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:15,679
would both get rid of the proof of work

2852
01:30:14,319 --> 01:30:16,399
requirements for one of these blocks to

2853
01:30:15,679 --> 01:30:18,880
be valid

2854
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:20,079
but instead you require these blocks to

2855
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,520
be embedded inside

2856
01:30:20,079 --> 01:30:23,119
of the proof of stake blocks right so

2857
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,920
you basically have like a chain inside a

2858
01:30:23,119 --> 01:30:26,079
chain

2859
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:28,079
and this is you know from an

2860
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:29,198
architecture perspective it's you know

2861
01:30:28,079 --> 01:30:31,359
you might think it's a little bit

2862
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:32,879
sub-optimal but it actually has some

2863
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:34,319
nice properties and makes it

2864
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:36,239
easier to kind of think about the

2865
01:30:34,319 --> 01:30:37,920
consensus and think about

2866
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:39,919
the what we call the execution layer

2867
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:40,639
like transactions and contracts kind of

2868
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:43,760
separately

2869
01:30:40,639 --> 01:30:46,000
and upgrade them separately um and

2870
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:47,600
it also just means that the upgrade

2871
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,319
process is extremely seamless right

2872
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:49,679
because

2873
01:30:48,319 --> 01:30:51,279
from the point of view of a client

2874
01:30:49,679 --> 01:30:51,679
that's following the chain you basically

2875
01:30:51,279 --> 01:30:54,079
have to

2876
01:30:51,679 --> 01:30:54,880
up update nothing right you're still

2877
01:30:54,079 --> 01:30:56,319
following

2878
01:30:54,880 --> 01:30:58,319
the same chain and follows the same

2879
01:30:56,319 --> 01:30:59,840
rules except instead of checking proof

2880
01:30:58,319 --> 01:31:01,519
of work you'll switch to

2881
01:30:59,840 --> 01:31:03,279
checking that these blocks are embedded

2882
01:31:01,520 --> 01:31:06,000
inside of blocks of the proof statute

2883
01:31:03,279 --> 01:31:08,079
so there'll be this merge block that

2884
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:11,039
will mark this transition

2885
01:31:08,079 --> 01:31:12,319
and over time i guess the the new chain

2886
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:14,639
will contain the full

2887
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:16,399
record of all the transactions that's

2888
01:31:14,639 --> 01:31:19,600
ever happened on the previous chain

2889
01:31:16,399 --> 01:31:21,759
on the old chain so like maybe i'm

2890
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:24,400
asking a dumb question here but

2891
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:25,520
in in this process is the new chain

2892
01:31:24,399 --> 01:31:27,920
going to have

2893
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:29,040
all the information of the past

2894
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:32,480
transactions

2895
01:31:29,039 --> 01:31:34,800
the new chain is not going to hold

2896
01:31:32,479 --> 01:31:36,559
information from what happened in the

2897
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:40,239
ethereum chain before the merge

2898
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:43,440
right so like ethereum clients of the um

2899
01:31:40,238 --> 01:31:44,879
that um people are going to use like

2900
01:31:43,439 --> 01:31:45,759
around the time of the merchants soon

2901
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,440
after the merge

2902
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:49,199
they're probably just going to sync you

2903
01:31:47,439 --> 01:31:49,759
know like and check the proof of work

2904
01:31:49,198 --> 01:31:50,879
chain

2905
01:31:49,760 --> 01:31:52,560
up to the merge and then they're going

2906
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:54,000
to check the proof of stake chain but at

2907
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,440
some point in the future i think people

2908
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,119
will just stop bothering checking the

2909
01:31:55,439 --> 01:31:59,359
proof of work before the merge

2910
01:31:57,119 --> 01:32:01,198
got it so that old history information

2911
01:31:59,359 --> 01:32:02,799
is not important

2912
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:04,960
for the future or like if you're

2913
01:32:02,800 --> 01:32:07,520
operating actively on the

2914
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:08,800
on the new chain that history is not

2915
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,440
important to you

2916
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,880
it's not impo let's see so it's not

2917
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:16,638
strictly important for

2918
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:18,159
um app for just like in any

2919
01:32:16,639 --> 01:32:19,840
like smart contract or just like

2920
01:32:18,158 --> 01:32:22,079
applications that run on the blockchain

2921
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:24,000
it can be important to users and it can

2922
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:26,399
be important for some applications

2923
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:28,158
but we're basically saying that like

2924
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:30,158
maintaining and serving that

2925
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:32,158
is not going to be simultaneously the

2926
01:32:30,158 --> 01:32:34,000
responsibility of every ethereum node

2927
01:32:32,158 --> 01:32:36,158
if you want that information there can

2928
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,760
be separate protocols for backing it up

2929
01:32:36,158 --> 01:32:39,359
and like these other protocols actually

2930
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:40,079
exist right like there's something

2931
01:32:39,359 --> 01:32:42,000
called the graph

2932
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:43,279
which is doing some history retrieval

2933
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,039
potentially you can just take that

2934
01:32:43,279 --> 01:32:45,439
entire chain and stick it on bit torrent

2935
01:32:45,039 --> 01:32:48,560
like

2936
01:32:45,439 --> 01:32:49,839
there's lots of ways to like archive it

2937
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,039
and create kind of customized search

2938
01:32:49,840 --> 01:32:53,840
protocols for it

2939
01:32:51,039 --> 01:32:56,560
so what's your sense why so there's a

2940
01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:59,199
python 2 in python 3 and it took 4

2941
01:32:56,560 --> 01:33:00,080
ever for people to switch what's your

2942
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:02,960
sense why this

2943
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:05,279
merge has been taking longer than

2944
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,760
perhaps was expected

2945
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:08,719
i think the biggest reason is just you

2946
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:10,880
know we've been

2947
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:12,480
underestimating the technical complexity

2948
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:14,400
there's a lot of technical complexity in

2949
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:17,519
making a successful proof of stake chain

2950
01:33:14,399 --> 01:33:19,759
there's a lot of technical complexity in

2951
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:20,880
actually figuring out the transition

2952
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:24,000
process

2953
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:26,079
there's so that's bigger than social

2954
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:27,760
complexity so it's uh the technical

2955
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:28,880
complexity you would say is the bigger

2956
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:31,360
reason for the

2957
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:32,880
any delays than the social complexity i

2958
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:35,279
i actually think so i and i

2959
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:36,960
i think we've been very fortunate to not

2960
01:33:35,279 --> 01:33:37,599
have too much social complexity around

2961
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:41,198
the merge

2962
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:42,880
so not much drama no um i think the

2963
01:33:41,198 --> 01:33:45,198
the biggest part of the reason is just

2964
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:46,560
because we have been talking about proof

2965
01:33:45,198 --> 01:33:48,079
of stake in charting as being part of

2966
01:33:46,560 --> 01:33:49,679
the road map since um

2967
01:33:48,079 --> 01:33:51,679
almost the very beginning of the project

2968
01:33:49,679 --> 01:33:52,639
right like the very first proof-of-stake

2969
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:55,840
blog post does

2970
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:57,760
from january 2014 which was you know um

2971
01:33:55,840 --> 01:34:00,079
two months after the project started and

2972
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,199
like maybe even a day after the

2973
01:34:00,079 --> 01:34:05,198
announcement

2974
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:07,359
um so you know it was proof of stake was

2975
01:34:05,198 --> 01:34:09,119
not something that we uh kind of put on

2976
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:11,279
any on anybody by surprise

2977
01:34:09,119 --> 01:34:12,960
and then when the dow fork happened and

2978
01:34:11,279 --> 01:34:13,679
you know the people on the edc side

2979
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:16,000
split off

2980
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:17,760
i think it also just happens that a lot

2981
01:34:16,000 --> 01:34:19,279
of the people that were not willing to

2982
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:20,320
stomach the dow fork and then join the

2983
01:34:19,279 --> 01:34:23,039
etc side

2984
01:34:20,319 --> 01:34:25,198
they were the more bitcoiny types and

2985
01:34:23,039 --> 01:34:26,719
the more bitcoiny types do also tends to

2986
01:34:25,198 --> 01:34:28,719
like like proof of work more

2987
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,760
and so like that also sort of ended up

2988
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:32,158
you know sort of

2989
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:33,119
like purifying the communities on both

2990
01:34:32,158 --> 01:34:35,039
sides i guess

2991
01:34:33,119 --> 01:34:36,158
so ethereum classic is not switching to

2992
01:34:35,039 --> 01:34:38,479
proof of stake and

2993
01:34:36,158 --> 01:34:39,679
you know they're happy with their setup

2994
01:34:38,479 --> 01:34:43,519
and

2995
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:45,279
by the time that uh you know it came

2996
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:46,800
through the beacon chain launching ends

2997
01:34:45,279 --> 01:34:48,479
and now i think the community is

2998
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:50,719
there's very strongly in favor of the

2999
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:53,759
proof of stake switch

3000
01:34:50,719 --> 01:34:56,480
but let me ask the question that no

3001
01:34:53,760 --> 01:35:00,639
engineer wants to hear which is uh the

3002
01:34:56,479 --> 01:35:02,238
question of timeline when do you think

3003
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:04,880
the merge

3004
01:35:02,238 --> 01:35:06,158
will happen do you have a sense it might

3005
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,000
happen this year

3006
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:10,238
dear sense it might be pushed towards

3007
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:14,238
next year 2022

3008
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:17,359
um or uh or even beyond

3009
01:35:14,238 --> 01:35:18,718
um i think early 2022 was like the most

3010
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:21,599
realistic

3011
01:35:18,719 --> 01:35:23,359
there's i think there's definitely still

3012
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:25,360
like an optimistic case of it happening

3013
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:27,039
this year but like

3014
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:30,000
the realistic thing to count on is

3015
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:31,679
definitely the early part of

3016
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:33,359
very early part of next year is there

3017
01:35:31,679 --> 01:35:34,000
specific things that stand out to you

3018
01:35:33,359 --> 01:35:37,118
that are

3019
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:37,840
like do they'll make you feel good about

3020
01:35:37,118 --> 01:35:40,960
progress

3021
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,440
if you see it happening um so the thing

3022
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,880
that we

3023
01:35:41,439 --> 01:35:46,960
had last month is that we had this

3024
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,560
online hackathon called rayonism where

3025
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:50,560
basically a bunch of uh

3026
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:52,400
the different uh client developers that

3027
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:55,199
are going to be part of the transition

3028
01:35:52,399 --> 01:35:57,439
like hacks together some test nets of

3029
01:35:55,198 --> 01:35:59,919
the post-merge ethereum chain

3030
01:35:57,439 --> 01:36:01,198
so these were only test nets of what

3031
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,279
would happen after the merge they were

3032
01:36:01,198 --> 01:36:05,919
not test nets of the transition itself

3033
01:36:03,279 --> 01:36:07,679
so the thing that people are working on

3034
01:36:05,920 --> 01:36:10,880
now actually is the transition

3035
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:12,880
um so having a

3036
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:14,319
full specification of both the

3037
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,400
transition and post transition

3038
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:18,639
i mean we have specifications now but

3039
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:20,000
like in a realistic way

3040
01:36:18,639 --> 01:36:21,920
though probably needs to have a couple

3041
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:23,198
of changes and have things that continue

3042
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:26,000
to be ironed out

3043
01:36:23,198 --> 01:36:26,960
and then have a yet test net that does

3044
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,719
both the transition

3045
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:30,399
and the post transition and then like

3046
01:36:28,719 --> 01:36:32,239
once you have a test network then

3047
01:36:30,399 --> 01:36:34,000
you just have to do a lot of testing and

3048
01:36:32,238 --> 01:36:37,039
audit it um and then

3049
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:38,800
you know do some runs on not just a

3050
01:36:37,039 --> 01:36:40,719
specialized test network but on say an

3051
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:42,000
existing test network like a rob center

3052
01:36:40,719 --> 01:36:45,118
rinkeby that

3053
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:46,719
ethereum people already significantly

3054
01:36:45,118 --> 01:36:49,439
use and if it works then

3055
01:36:46,719 --> 01:36:50,719
you can deploy the transition on mainnet

3056
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:53,118
just as a quick comment

3057
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:54,239
because this is fascinating in august of

3058
01:36:53,118 --> 01:36:57,599
last year

3059
01:36:54,238 --> 01:37:00,158
there was this uh medalla

3060
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:01,119
i believe it's pronounced madasha it's a

3061
01:37:00,158 --> 01:37:03,439
south american

3062
01:37:01,118 --> 01:37:04,799
subway station i forget where but spell

3063
01:37:03,439 --> 01:37:06,000
with two l's

3064
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,600
yeah yeah because that's you know that's

3065
01:37:06,000 --> 01:37:09,520
how spanish works right like the two

3066
01:37:07,600 --> 01:37:12,000
else have uh

3067
01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,880
dasha yeah okay cool anyway but i read

3068
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:15,600
about it

3069
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,639
in uh middle of august august 14th there

3070
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:20,560
was an incident

3071
01:37:16,639 --> 01:37:22,800
on that test net um what how does this

3072
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:24,480
process work like what do you learn from

3073
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,119
those kinds of incidents when stuff goes

3074
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:28,638
wrong

3075
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:30,238
in the test process um i think uh that

3076
01:37:28,639 --> 01:37:32,159
incidence was that

3077
01:37:30,238 --> 01:37:33,678
there was a consensus failure of some

3078
01:37:32,158 --> 01:37:35,519
kindness i remember um

3079
01:37:33,679 --> 01:37:36,960
basically just different clients

3080
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:38,320
interpreting things in different ways

3081
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:39,359
and then one of them getting kicked off

3082
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:42,079
the network

3083
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:43,198
and then it ended up taking a while to

3084
01:37:42,079 --> 01:37:45,359
actually like

3085
01:37:43,198 --> 01:37:46,879
get everyone to get back online like a

3086
01:37:45,359 --> 01:37:49,279
big part of the reason why it took weeks

3087
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:51,440
to resolve right is because

3088
01:37:49,279 --> 01:37:52,960
it's on a test network like the coins

3089
01:37:51,439 --> 01:37:55,759
are valueless and so there's

3090
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:56,960
not really this big push of any kind for

3091
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:58,560
people to actually

3092
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:00,399
you know going down with a new client so

3093
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,400
they can start participating again

3094
01:38:00,399 --> 01:38:04,479
and so you know it definitely took a

3095
01:38:02,399 --> 01:38:05,118
while until the chain started finalizing

3096
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:08,399
again um

3097
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:09,359
but and then also like there was i think

3098
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:11,920
another

3099
01:38:09,359 --> 01:38:12,880
round of just not finalizing in october

3100
01:38:11,920 --> 01:38:16,319
as i remember

3101
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:17,920
um that i mean there were definitely

3102
01:38:16,319 --> 01:38:20,238
things that we learned like there were

3103
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:21,840
a lot of things especially that client

3104
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:22,799
developers just learned about like

3105
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:26,000
optimization

3106
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:27,279
and how to build their clients in a way

3107
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,920
that they can process things

3108
01:38:27,279 --> 01:38:31,599
efficiently um there's a lot that we

3109
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:33,359
learned from just like seeing the full

3110
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:34,960
life cycle of what happens when

3111
01:38:33,359 --> 01:38:37,039
more than a third of the validators go

3112
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:40,639
offline and then finalization stops

3113
01:38:37,039 --> 01:38:42,319
and then that kind of

3114
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:44,000
weird unusual state of the chain

3115
01:38:42,319 --> 01:38:45,359
continues for a while and then

3116
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:47,039
eventually everyone who is not

3117
01:38:45,359 --> 01:38:49,839
participating just

3118
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:51,439
gets enough of their stake like we don't

3119
01:38:49,840 --> 01:38:53,279
use the word swash we use the word weak

3120
01:38:51,439 --> 01:38:55,439
for this but like basically also burned

3121
01:38:53,279 --> 01:38:56,960
um until you know the people who are

3122
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:58,479
participating go back up to two thirds

3123
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,600
and then the chain goes back to

3124
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:02,319
finalizing

3125
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:04,079
so just seeing all of those edge cases

3126
01:39:02,319 --> 01:39:05,279
play out live i think actually helped a

3127
01:39:04,079 --> 01:39:06,880
lot and probably helped to really

3128
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:08,960
contribute to

3129
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:10,480
making us feel better about midnight i

3130
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:13,679
mean there's also an incident

3131
01:39:10,479 --> 01:39:16,879
just recently in april 24th

3132
01:39:13,679 --> 01:39:20,079
of 2021 where uh

3133
01:39:16,880 --> 01:39:21,920
this was on beacon i guess there was a

3134
01:39:20,079 --> 01:39:22,559
bug discovered in the software client

3135
01:39:21,920 --> 01:39:24,319
prism

3136
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,000
that prevented roughly 70 percent of

3137
01:39:24,319 --> 01:39:29,439
validators on the network

3138
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:31,920
from producing blocks i mean maybe you

3139
01:39:29,439 --> 01:39:34,638
can comment on what happened but

3140
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:35,199
broadly like the big picture what kind

3141
01:39:34,639 --> 01:39:38,000
of stuff

3142
01:39:35,198 --> 01:39:39,359
are you worried about in terms of

3143
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:41,439
problems that might arise

3144
01:39:39,359 --> 01:39:42,399
we're talking about small bugs i were

3145
01:39:41,439 --> 01:39:46,238
talking about

3146
01:39:42,399 --> 01:39:48,719
like emergent social unexpected

3147
01:39:46,238 --> 01:39:50,559
social bugs you know what are the things

3148
01:39:48,719 --> 01:39:51,279
that worry about the future of ethereum

3149
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,719
that

3150
01:39:51,279 --> 01:39:54,158
you want to make sure you construct

3151
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:55,359
mechanisms that prevent those things

3152
01:39:54,158 --> 01:39:57,519
from happening

3153
01:39:55,359 --> 01:40:00,079
so one of the lucky things there was

3154
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:02,159
that this particular bug only prevented

3155
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:03,039
proposals of blocks it did not prevent

3156
01:40:02,158 --> 01:40:04,399
attestations

3157
01:40:03,039 --> 01:40:06,238
right so at the stations is just a

3158
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:07,759
mechanism for voting on blocks

3159
01:40:06,238 --> 01:40:09,118
and it's the attestations that are

3160
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,960
actually responsible for the chain

3161
01:40:09,118 --> 01:40:12,880
finalizing so like coming to this

3162
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:15,279
more permanent agreement on blocks right

3163
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:16,480
so the chain was actually quite stable

3164
01:40:15,279 --> 01:40:20,079
all the way through

3165
01:40:16,479 --> 01:40:20,718
um the i think the thing that we

3166
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:22,960
generally

3167
01:40:20,719 --> 01:40:23,840
learned from these experience

3168
01:40:22,960 --> 01:40:26,639
experiences

3169
01:40:23,840 --> 01:40:28,159
is just how valuable it is to have the

3170
01:40:26,639 --> 01:40:29,600
some multi-client network

3171
01:40:28,158 --> 01:40:31,279
right so this is one of these areas

3172
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:33,360
where i think ethereum distinguishes

3173
01:40:31,279 --> 01:40:36,960
itself from like bitcoin for example

3174
01:40:33,359 --> 01:40:40,319
right that in ethereum we don't have

3175
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:42,399
one single client that that everyone

3176
01:40:40,319 --> 01:40:43,599
um just runs right there's multiple

3177
01:40:42,399 --> 01:40:45,039
implementations of

3178
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:47,119
the protocol and these multiple

3179
01:40:45,039 --> 01:40:50,000
implementations they're they all

3180
01:40:47,118 --> 01:40:50,799
process and verify the blocks that each

3181
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,118
other can

3182
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:54,159
you know verify right so they all speak

3183
01:40:53,118 --> 01:40:55,759
the same language

3184
01:40:54,158 --> 01:40:57,198
now sometimes when there's a bug they

3185
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:58,960
disagree right and

3186
01:40:57,198 --> 01:41:01,039
when two clients disagree because of a

3187
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,480
bug we call this a consensus failure

3188
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:04,639
and consensus failures are pretty

3189
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:07,839
serious right and when

3190
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:08,800
you have um clients monoculture like

3191
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:11,360
bitcoin does

3192
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:13,199
then like it's more rare to have

3193
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:14,799
consensus failures do you still have

3194
01:41:13,198 --> 01:41:16,399
them actually bitcoin had a consensus

3195
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,960
failure between two different versions

3196
01:41:16,399 --> 01:41:22,158
of the same client back in 2013

3197
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:24,079
um but they're less likely to happen but

3198
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:26,638
the interesting thing is that the

3199
01:41:24,079 --> 01:41:29,118
multi-client architecture has actually

3200
01:41:26,639 --> 01:41:30,000
i think saved ethereum much more than

3201
01:41:29,118 --> 01:41:31,759
it's heard it

3202
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:33,039
so even in this most recent incidents

3203
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:34,239
right like prism was not producing

3204
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:35,840
blocks but all the other clients were

3205
01:41:34,238 --> 01:41:38,718
still producing blocks

3206
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:39,520
um there's four others right yes it's a

3207
01:41:38,719 --> 01:41:43,279
prism

3208
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:46,239
nimbus teku and the white house um

3209
01:41:43,279 --> 01:41:46,880
and then also ethereum back in 2016 had

3210
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:48,479
this fun

3211
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:50,319
event that we call the shanghai dos

3212
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:50,799
attacks uh they're called that because

3213
01:41:50,319 --> 01:41:53,759
uh

3214
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:54,960
the attacks started like right on the

3215
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:57,039
first day of a

3216
01:41:54,960 --> 01:41:59,359
of our annual conference at defcon that

3217
01:41:57,039 --> 01:42:02,479
happens to be in shanghai that year

3218
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:04,960
so what happened like basically was that

3219
01:42:02,479 --> 01:42:05,678
someone came up with a way to create

3220
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:08,239
blocks

3221
01:42:05,679 --> 01:42:10,000
that were very slow for one clients to

3222
01:42:08,238 --> 01:42:11,839
process but not the other client

3223
01:42:10,000 --> 01:42:13,359
so at that time there were basically two

3224
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,719
ethereum clients there were they were

3225
01:42:13,359 --> 01:42:17,359
called geth and parity

3226
01:42:14,719 --> 01:42:17,920
um right now i think the top three ones

3227
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:21,279
are

3228
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:22,880
gath nethermind and baso um but

3229
01:42:21,279 --> 01:42:24,880
what happened as a result of us having

3230
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,199
two clients is that the attacker was

3231
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,118
just

3232
01:42:25,198 --> 01:42:28,799
not able to come up with blocks that

3233
01:42:27,118 --> 01:42:32,158
both clients were

3234
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:33,840
like uh completely failing at processing

3235
01:42:32,158 --> 01:42:35,279
and so like a lot of the miners and a

3236
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,560
lot of network participants they just

3237
01:42:35,279 --> 01:42:37,679
kept on switching between the two

3238
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:39,280
implementations

3239
01:42:37,679 --> 01:42:42,639
depending on which one worked and that

3240
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:42,639
actually really helped the

3241
01:42:42,719 --> 01:42:46,719
the chain i kind of survived through

3242
01:42:45,118 --> 01:42:47,759
that month of attacks as the attacker

3243
01:42:46,719 --> 01:42:49,760
just like kept on

3244
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:51,119
hammering at our system and identifying

3245
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:53,280
all of the weaknesses

3246
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:54,158
and just like forcing our clients to do

3247
01:42:53,279 --> 01:42:56,158
this you know

3248
01:42:54,158 --> 01:42:57,839
rapid sprint of just like optimizing the

3249
01:42:56,158 --> 01:43:00,000
hell out of everything and make sure

3250
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:00,960
there aren't any of those uh dust blocks

3251
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,600
or uh

3252
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:04,639
and dust bugs remaining um so that was

3253
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:06,480
another example

3254
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,760
and then like as a counterpoint as a

3255
01:43:06,479 --> 01:43:09,839
counter example so

3256
01:43:07,760 --> 01:43:10,800
like something that also shows the point

3257
01:43:09,840 --> 01:43:13,520
from the other side

3258
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,000
um bitcoin had this bug in 2010 right

3259
01:43:13,520 --> 01:43:17,760
the

3260
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:19,439
balance overflow bug basically someone

3261
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:20,960
created a transaction that had two

3262
01:43:19,439 --> 01:43:24,000
outputs and those

3263
01:43:20,960 --> 01:43:26,000
outputs had were both of a few billion

3264
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:27,840
bitcoin so like about two to the power

3265
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:28,960
of 63 satoshis

3266
01:43:27,840 --> 01:43:30,719
and then if you add those numbers

3267
01:43:28,960 --> 01:43:31,679
together you you go above to the power

3268
01:43:30,719 --> 01:43:33,840
of 64.

3269
01:43:31,679 --> 01:43:36,079
and of course you know computers like

3270
01:43:33,840 --> 01:43:36,880
once you go above to the power of 64 you

3271
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:39,840
wrap around

3272
01:43:36,880 --> 01:43:41,039
and so the bitcoin nodes thought that

3273
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:42,560
there was enough money to pay for the

3274
01:43:41,039 --> 01:43:44,000
transaction because it was asking for

3275
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:45,840
let's say like a billion satoshis or

3276
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,639
something but actually it was asking for

3277
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:50,000
to the power of 64 plus a billion and so

3278
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,800
you know the attacker just managed to

3279
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,840
create like

3280
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:57,279
billions of bitcoin out of thin air and

3281
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:59,360
this was not only discovered and fixed

3282
01:43:57,279 --> 01:44:02,238
after something like 12 hours

3283
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:03,599
um but you know if there had been like

3284
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:05,039
if bitcoin had been a multiple

3285
01:44:03,600 --> 01:44:07,600
implementation system

3286
01:44:05,039 --> 01:44:08,158
then what would have almost certainly

3287
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:10,079
happened

3288
01:44:08,158 --> 01:44:11,679
is like one of the clients would have

3289
01:44:10,079 --> 01:44:12,158
bugged out but the other clients would

3290
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:14,079
have

3291
01:44:12,158 --> 01:44:15,839
probably you know actually had a check

3292
01:44:14,079 --> 01:44:16,960
for that right and so

3293
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:19,520
there would have been a consensus

3294
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:21,840
failure but at least that would have

3295
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:23,280
um like alerted everyone that there is a

3296
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:25,199
problem very

3297
01:44:23,279 --> 01:44:26,800
quickly and it also would have given

3298
01:44:25,198 --> 01:44:27,839
everyone just like obvious social

3299
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,600
permission to go and

3300
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:31,520
you know pick which whichever one of the

3301
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:34,719
chains is correct and solve the problem

3302
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:36,880
um so like that's

3303
01:44:34,719 --> 01:44:37,920
i think a big learning that we've had

3304
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:39,600
from multiple

3305
01:44:37,920 --> 01:44:40,960
of our experiences in the ethereum

3306
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:43,199
ecosystem just like

3307
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,719
validating this multi-client model you

3308
01:44:43,198 --> 01:44:46,799
know to be fair it's a model that we get

3309
01:44:44,719 --> 01:44:48,319
criticized for a lot right like

3310
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,000
bitcoin people talk about you know the

3311
01:44:48,319 --> 01:44:50,719
risk of consensus failures that this

3312
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:53,359
creates

3313
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:55,118
um vc types are like well you know isn't

3314
01:44:53,359 --> 01:44:56,399
it expensive and wasteful to funds three

3315
01:44:55,118 --> 01:44:57,679
software teams where you could just be

3316
01:44:56,399 --> 01:44:59,759
making you know one

3317
01:44:57,679 --> 01:45:01,359
quote focused effort you know they love

3318
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:03,039
the word focused and like you know

3319
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:04,479
ethereum is not that but it's amazing

3320
01:45:03,039 --> 01:45:08,079
despite not being that

3321
01:45:04,479 --> 01:45:08,079
yeah um the

3322
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:13,679
basically yes so that was interesting

3323
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:15,760
and and then you know there have

3324
01:45:13,679 --> 01:45:17,600
definitely been other

3325
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:18,880
learnings as well just from like seeing

3326
01:45:17,600 --> 01:45:21,679
the chain live and

3327
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:22,800
you know seeing what actually is the

3328
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:24,960
staking experience

3329
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:26,480
like what are the actual incentives for

3330
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:28,560
all the different participants um

3331
01:45:26,479 --> 01:45:30,799
so i definitely feel like we're gaining

3332
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:32,320
a lot from this sort of one year of uh

3333
01:45:30,800 --> 01:45:34,079
trial running the chain before we

3334
01:45:32,319 --> 01:45:35,519
actually make all of ethereum depend on

3335
01:45:34,079 --> 01:45:37,519
it

3336
01:45:35,520 --> 01:45:39,760
let me ask uh perhaps a strange question

3337
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:40,480
but uh you know proponents of bitcoin

3338
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:44,079
will say

3339
01:45:40,479 --> 01:45:47,439
uh things like bitcoin fixes everything

3340
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:51,279
so why do we need ethereum

3341
01:45:47,439 --> 01:45:54,079
uh versus like bitcoin

3342
01:45:51,279 --> 01:45:56,158
plus lightning network for scalability

3343
01:45:54,079 --> 01:45:58,880
uh and then using bitcoin for

3344
01:45:56,158 --> 01:46:00,879
with this proof of work for security so

3345
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,639
in this kind of um

3346
01:46:00,880 --> 01:46:04,079
it is perhaps sort of a strange question

3347
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:07,199
but it's a high-level question

3348
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:09,679
why do we need another technology

3349
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:10,319
yes there's a bunch of nice features but

3350
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:13,118
like

3351
01:46:10,319 --> 01:46:13,519
doesn't bitcoin fix everything already

3352
01:46:13,118 --> 01:46:16,079
so

3353
01:46:13,520 --> 01:46:16,639
and the thing that always attracted me

3354
01:46:16,079 --> 01:46:19,279
about

3355
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:21,440
bitcoin is you know these values of you

3356
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:23,519
know decentralization creating these

3357
01:46:21,439 --> 01:46:24,638
open provisional systems that anyone can

3358
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,719
participate in

3359
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:28,319
and that aren't just going to flop over

3360
01:46:26,719 --> 01:46:29,920
and die if whoever created them gets

3361
01:46:28,319 --> 01:46:33,359
bored and like no

3362
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:34,719
that are resistance to like whoever runs

3363
01:46:33,359 --> 01:46:35,839
them breaking the rules and all of these

3364
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:38,000
things right and

3365
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:39,119
i think that pretty strongly that these

3366
01:46:38,000 --> 01:46:41,039
principles are

3367
01:46:39,118 --> 01:46:42,559
like really valid in importance to much

3368
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:43,279
more things than just money right like

3369
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:45,600
bitcoin is

3370
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:46,319
uh the blockchain for money and ethereum

3371
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,840
is uh

3372
01:46:46,319 --> 01:46:49,679
built from the start as a general

3373
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:51,679
purpose blockchain right it's you know

3374
01:46:49,679 --> 01:46:53,359
there is ether the asset on ethereum but

3375
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:56,239
then you can also make

3376
01:46:53,359 --> 01:46:57,839
you know decentralized financial things

3377
01:46:56,238 --> 01:46:59,519
what we call d5 today

3378
01:46:57,840 --> 01:47:01,760
um you know you can make like ens the

3379
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:04,560
decentralized domain name system

3380
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:05,039
um you can put make prediction markets

3381
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:08,639
on it

3382
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:10,719
you can make totally non-financial

3383
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:11,920
systems that just like keep track of

3384
01:47:10,719 --> 01:47:13,679
whether or not

3385
01:47:11,920 --> 01:47:15,840
some certificate was signed or whether

3386
01:47:13,679 --> 01:47:16,719
or not some like cryptographic key got

3387
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:20,400
revoked

3388
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:21,760
there's this big long list of like just

3389
01:47:20,399 --> 01:47:23,118
interesting things that you could use

3390
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:25,520
about blockchains to do

3391
01:47:23,118 --> 01:47:26,479
right like basically they are sort of

3392
01:47:25,520 --> 01:47:29,840
the missing piece

3393
01:47:26,479 --> 01:47:31,198
that um where without them the kinds of

3394
01:47:29,840 --> 01:47:32,719
things that a decentralized computer

3395
01:47:31,198 --> 01:47:34,079
network can do is very limited

3396
01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:36,000
and once you have them you know a lot of

3397
01:47:34,079 --> 01:47:39,840
those limitations end up going away

3398
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:41,520
uh and so

3399
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,440
ethereum was like always from the

3400
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,080
beginning about that right it's about

3401
01:47:43,439 --> 01:47:46,399
like hey

3402
01:47:44,079 --> 01:47:48,079
this isn't just money this is there's so

3403
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:50,399
much more that you could do

3404
01:47:48,079 --> 01:47:51,439
if you could just go ahead and make any

3405
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:54,000
infrastructure

3406
01:47:51,439 --> 01:47:55,519
or you know digital institution or dao

3407
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:58,000
or whatever you want to call it

3408
01:47:55,520 --> 01:48:00,000
where you the kind of the base layer of

3409
01:47:58,000 --> 01:48:02,000
the logic is just executed in this open

3410
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,079
and transparent way where everyone can

3411
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:05,520
see what's going on or you know if you

3412
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:07,118
like your zero knowledge proofs at least

3413
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:07,679
everyone can see proofs that prove to

3414
01:48:07,118 --> 01:48:10,238
you that

3415
01:48:07,679 --> 01:48:11,279
what's going on follows the rules um and

3416
01:48:10,238 --> 01:48:13,599
you don't need to

3417
01:48:11,279 --> 01:48:14,880
like just constantly keep trusting

3418
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:18,079
centralized actors

3419
01:48:14,880 --> 01:48:20,560
and hence the smart contracts exactly

3420
01:48:18,079 --> 01:48:21,439
as being a sort of a core technology as

3421
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:24,159
part of ethereum

3422
01:48:21,439 --> 01:48:25,759
yes exactly smart contracts the computer

3423
01:48:24,158 --> 01:48:27,599
programs that are running on ethereum

3424
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:28,960
they are like the core of what makes

3425
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:32,960
ethereum general purpose

3426
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:35,439
yeah um so i think like i do think that

3427
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,480
you know there's a lot more that wrong

3428
01:48:35,439 --> 01:48:38,079
with the world than

3429
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:39,678
just money right like i'm not one of

3430
01:48:38,079 --> 01:48:42,000
these people who thinks that

3431
01:48:39,679 --> 01:48:43,440
you know if you get rid of fiat currency

3432
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:45,118
and you replace it with cryptocurrency

3433
01:48:43,439 --> 01:48:46,158
then suddenly wars are going to go away

3434
01:48:45,118 --> 01:48:48,079
right because

3435
01:48:46,158 --> 01:48:50,158
like first of all um you know like

3436
01:48:48,079 --> 01:48:51,679
senoraj revenue is only a small portion

3437
01:48:50,158 --> 01:48:52,238
of government revenue right it's like

3438
01:48:51,679 --> 01:48:54,319
what

3439
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:56,319
five ten percent something like that

3440
01:48:54,319 --> 01:48:59,198
second of all like if

3441
01:48:56,319 --> 01:49:00,319
you are the sort of um this is one of

3442
01:48:59,198 --> 01:49:01,359
the things i don't even get about their

3443
01:49:00,319 --> 01:49:02,880
philosophy like

3444
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:05,198
let's say you're the sort of person who

3445
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,960
is a like an extreme and very

3446
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:08,638
distrusting libertarian and you think

3447
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,880
that these governments are terrible

3448
01:49:08,639 --> 01:49:13,520
right like we we know today that

3449
01:49:10,880 --> 01:49:16,079
governments find a combination of

3450
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:18,320
you know things like welfare and things

3451
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:19,920
like you know the military that

3452
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:21,679
you know goes and like bombs people in

3453
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:23,359
afghanistan right and

3454
01:49:21,679 --> 01:49:24,719
the so the question you have to ask is

3455
01:49:23,359 --> 01:49:28,479
like okay you

3456
01:49:24,719 --> 01:49:30,560
um with your new um you know

3457
01:49:28,479 --> 01:49:32,079
magic newfangled cyber currency that

3458
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:33,760
takes over the world

3459
01:49:32,079 --> 01:49:35,439
take away the government's ability to

3460
01:49:33,760 --> 01:49:37,599
have seniors revenue and so you reduce

3461
01:49:35,439 --> 01:49:39,759
the government's revenue by 10

3462
01:49:37,599 --> 01:49:41,039
if the government is that evil which

3463
01:49:39,760 --> 01:49:43,039
portion of its um

3464
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:44,960
expenses is it going to take that 10

3465
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:46,399
from is it gonna stop the bombing people

3466
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,520
in afghanistan or is it going to cut

3467
01:49:46,399 --> 01:49:48,799
welfare

3468
01:49:47,520 --> 01:49:50,800
if you think it's the first you have a

3469
01:49:48,800 --> 01:49:54,079
very optimistic view of the government

3470
01:49:50,800 --> 01:49:57,360
right so that's

3471
01:49:54,079 --> 01:49:58,399
i guess my perspective on like why the

3472
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:01,198
whole um you know

3473
01:49:58,399 --> 01:50:01,519
we're going to save the world and create

3474
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:03,919
and

3475
01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:05,679
uh create peace by like denying

3476
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,920
governments the right to stealth

3477
01:50:05,679 --> 01:50:09,359
taxation kind of perspective doesn't

3478
01:50:07,920 --> 01:50:11,118
really make much sense for me

3479
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:12,960
and i do think that there is real value

3480
01:50:11,118 --> 01:50:15,118
that comes from a

3481
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:17,599
decentralized and open currency like

3482
01:50:15,118 --> 01:50:19,439
just the fact that there is a financial

3483
01:50:17,599 --> 01:50:19,920
infrastructure that anyone in the world

3484
01:50:19,439 --> 01:50:21,598
can

3485
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:23,118
you know go ahead and use right like

3486
01:50:21,599 --> 01:50:24,560
it's

3487
01:50:23,118 --> 01:50:26,000
and that's something that can easily be

3488
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:27,280
a big boon for people right there's a

3489
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:30,639
lot of places

3490
01:50:27,279 --> 01:50:34,158
where the uh currency and

3491
01:50:30,639 --> 01:50:35,440
is much less stable than the dollar and

3492
01:50:34,158 --> 01:50:37,439
you know these people like they don't

3493
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:39,039
like well if they use bitcoin

3494
01:50:37,439 --> 01:50:40,399
their only option is to get big ones

3495
01:50:39,039 --> 01:50:41,198
right which you know are also pretty

3496
01:50:40,399 --> 01:50:43,439
volatile

3497
01:50:41,198 --> 01:50:44,638
um if they use ethereum then you know

3498
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:46,000
they can get ether but then they can

3499
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:48,000
also get stable coins right

3500
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,760
and you might think that you know oh

3501
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:51,039
you're not being ideologically pure

3502
01:50:49,760 --> 01:50:52,320
now you're giving them stable coins

3503
01:50:51,039 --> 01:50:53,679
which are mirroring dollars and

3504
01:50:52,319 --> 01:50:54,158
obviously dollars are going to collapse

3505
01:50:53,679 --> 01:50:55,760
too

3506
01:50:54,158 --> 01:50:57,359
but the reality is that delvers are

3507
01:50:55,760 --> 01:50:58,400
vastly more stable than the venezuelan

3508
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:01,439
bolivar

3509
01:50:58,399 --> 01:51:04,158
so like there are

3510
01:51:01,439 --> 01:51:05,198
really like meaningful and beneficial

3511
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:07,679
things that you can

3512
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:09,039
give to people by create having a global

3513
01:51:07,679 --> 01:51:11,359
and open financial system

3514
01:51:09,039 --> 01:51:12,719
but i think if you want to actually do

3515
01:51:11,359 --> 01:51:14,158
that like you have to have much more

3516
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:15,359
than just a currency right

3517
01:51:14,158 --> 01:51:17,198
and then if you want to go beyond

3518
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:17,759
financial things then you know you have

3519
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:20,799
to

3520
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:21,360
obviously have much more than a currency

3521
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,039
and then

3522
01:51:21,359 --> 01:51:24,880
you know you also have to actually

3523
01:51:23,039 --> 01:51:26,479
actually take scalability seriously

3524
01:51:24,880 --> 01:51:28,000
because the non-financial applications

3525
01:51:26,479 --> 01:51:30,959
like nobody's going to pay five dollars

3526
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:30,960
a transaction for them

3527
01:51:31,039 --> 01:51:36,158
can we return to dogs sure

3528
01:51:37,118 --> 01:51:43,198
no no no no no no no no the other one's

3529
01:51:40,639 --> 01:51:44,639
categorically forbidden get categorical

3530
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:46,960
is there any cryptocurrency based on

3531
01:51:44,639 --> 01:51:47,440
cats actually i i think there are like

3532
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:49,439
was

3533
01:51:47,439 --> 01:51:50,960
there was cat coin there was neon coin

3534
01:51:49,439 --> 01:51:51,839
for some reason they just didn't catch

3535
01:51:50,960 --> 01:51:54,480
on as much as

3536
01:51:51,840 --> 01:51:57,760
the dog coins did okay so let's talk

3537
01:51:54,479 --> 01:52:01,519
about dogecoin and elon musk

3538
01:51:57,760 --> 01:52:04,639
elon said that quote ideally

3539
01:52:01,520 --> 01:52:08,000
doge speeds up block time 10x

3540
01:52:04,639 --> 01:52:11,679
increases block size 10x and drops

3541
01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:14,880
fee 100x then it wins

3542
01:52:11,679 --> 01:52:17,440
hands down end quote you said

3543
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:18,159
in the blog post partially responding to

3544
01:52:17,439 --> 01:52:20,479
that

3545
01:52:18,158 --> 01:52:23,679
that there are subtle technical reasons

3546
01:52:20,479 --> 01:52:27,598
why this is not possible

3547
01:52:23,679 --> 01:52:31,118
to this elon said that you quote

3548
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:31,599
fear the doge uh so let's talk about

3549
01:52:31,118 --> 01:52:34,000
this

3550
01:52:31,599 --> 01:52:35,840
what are the technical uh hurdles for

3551
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,198
dogecoin that prevent it from becoming

3552
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:39,599
one of the primary

3553
01:52:37,198 --> 01:52:40,238
cryptocurrencies of the world and do you

3554
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:42,079
in fact

3555
01:52:40,238 --> 01:52:43,598
fear the doge i definitely feel

3556
01:52:42,079 --> 01:52:44,158
obligated to correct the record i

3557
01:52:43,599 --> 01:52:46,239
definitely

3558
01:52:44,158 --> 01:52:48,000
do not fear the dosh okay no i love the

3559
01:52:46,238 --> 01:52:50,079
dosh um i actually

3560
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:51,599
visited the doge in japan a few years

3561
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:53,840
back it's uh

3562
01:52:51,599 --> 01:52:55,599
she's an amazing dog he's still alive

3563
01:52:53,840 --> 01:52:58,800
wait the original doge yeah

3564
01:52:55,599 --> 01:53:02,079
oh wow um

3565
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:04,079
so you know we accept doge every

3566
01:53:02,079 --> 01:53:05,118
every year for our annual def con

3567
01:53:04,079 --> 01:53:08,479
conferences

3568
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:10,319
um so and i definitely you know don't

3569
01:53:08,479 --> 01:53:10,718
think ethereum is opposed to dot coins i

3570
01:53:10,319 --> 01:53:13,118
mean

3571
01:53:10,719 --> 01:53:14,560
like i kind of wants to feel like you

3572
01:53:13,118 --> 01:53:16,399
know ethereum is at least a little bit

3573
01:53:14,560 --> 01:53:18,320
in spirit itself a dog coin and then you

3574
01:53:16,399 --> 01:53:19,759
know as i'm as i mentioned you know i

3575
01:53:18,319 --> 01:53:21,279
love doge i bought

3576
01:53:19,760 --> 01:53:22,800
i bought a bunch of doughs i still hold

3577
01:53:21,279 --> 01:53:25,759
some a bunch of dosh

3578
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:27,520
the on the scalability question like the

3579
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:30,079
challenge basically is like

3580
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:31,679
the limits uh scalability as a and the

3581
01:53:30,079 --> 01:53:32,960
trade-offs with centralization right

3582
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:34,399
like if you just

3583
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:36,239
increase the parameters without doing

3584
01:53:34,399 --> 01:53:37,759
anything else then it just becomes

3585
01:53:36,238 --> 01:53:39,279
more and more difficult for people to

3586
01:53:37,760 --> 01:53:41,920
validate the chain and uh

3587
01:53:39,279 --> 01:53:43,359
just becomes more likely that the chain

3588
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:44,800
becomes centralized and

3589
01:53:43,359 --> 01:53:47,279
becomes vulnerable to all kinds of

3590
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:48,800
capture so does it need like

3591
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:50,319
some of the layer two technologies that

3592
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:52,239
we've been talking about

3593
01:53:50,319 --> 01:53:54,238
um i mean i personally think that you

3594
01:53:52,238 --> 01:53:55,839
know if doge wants to

3595
01:53:54,238 --> 01:53:58,158
somehow bridge to ethereum and then

3596
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:59,199
people can trade doge thousands of times

3597
01:53:58,158 --> 01:54:00,399
a second inside of

3598
01:53:59,198 --> 01:54:02,960
loopering then you know that would be

3599
01:54:00,399 --> 01:54:05,359
amazing i mean if they want to just like

3600
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:07,118
take zika roll up style technology and

3601
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:09,279
just have thousands of transactions a

3602
01:54:07,118 --> 01:54:10,719
second on their own chain then that's um

3603
01:54:09,279 --> 01:54:12,880
you know that would be a great outcome

3604
01:54:10,719 --> 01:54:13,679
as well so what is there ways for

3605
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:16,719
ethereum

3606
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:20,319
and uh dogecoin to work together so

3607
01:54:16,719 --> 01:54:22,880
okay so there's a power behind a person

3608
01:54:20,319 --> 01:54:25,519
like elon musk pushing the development

3609
01:54:22,880 --> 01:54:28,560
of a cryptocurrency

3610
01:54:25,520 --> 01:54:29,920
is there ways to leverage that power and

3611
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:32,080
that momentum

3612
01:54:29,920 --> 01:54:32,960
to improve ethereum to improve some of

3613
01:54:32,079 --> 01:54:36,158
the

3614
01:54:32,960 --> 01:54:38,079
sort of uh cryptocurrencies that are

3615
01:54:36,158 --> 01:54:41,279
already technologically advanced and

3616
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:44,319
pushing forward that kind of technology

3617
01:54:41,279 --> 01:54:46,880
i i definitely think there is room

3618
01:54:44,319 --> 01:54:48,000
for you know that uh there's that meme

3619
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,400
of doge like

3620
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:52,000
taking over that's the door i've seen it

3621
01:54:50,399 --> 01:54:55,920
is there a way to ride that

3622
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:58,079
uh that storm that wave of the doge

3623
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:00,880
has taken over i think if we could have

3624
01:54:58,079 --> 01:55:02,079
a secure doshu ethereum bridge then

3625
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:04,319
you know that would be amazing and then

3626
01:55:02,079 --> 01:55:06,639
when ethereum gets its scalability

3627
01:55:04,319 --> 01:55:08,158
any scalability thing that works for

3628
01:55:06,639 --> 01:55:08,880
ethereum assets you would be able to

3629
01:55:08,158 --> 01:55:11,118
also like

3630
01:55:08,880 --> 01:55:12,719
trade wrapped doors with extremely low

3631
01:55:11,118 --> 01:55:13,198
transaction fees and very high speed as

3632
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:15,198
well

3633
01:55:13,198 --> 01:55:16,879
is there uh is there precedence for

3634
01:55:15,198 --> 01:55:18,399
building secure bridges between

3635
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:20,000
cryptocurrencies

3636
01:55:18,399 --> 01:55:21,759
is that i mean how difficult is this

3637
01:55:20,000 --> 01:55:23,920
kind of task that's it's definitely

3638
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:25,280
something that's in its infancy infancy

3639
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:26,880
there definitely have been some

3640
01:55:25,279 --> 01:55:27,920
cross-chain interaction things that have

3641
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,760
been done before

3642
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:31,599
um so one the earliest is probably the

3643
01:55:29,760 --> 01:55:34,079
concept of merge mining right when

3644
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:36,319
a chain just makes its entire

3645
01:55:34,079 --> 01:55:37,920
proof-of-work algorithm dependent on

3646
01:55:36,319 --> 01:55:39,599
the proof-of-work algorithm of another

3647
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:41,760
chain and so i think

3648
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,039
famous doshcoin actually merged mines

3649
01:55:41,760 --> 01:55:44,480
the litecoin which is

3650
01:55:43,039 --> 01:55:46,079
i think in retrospect it's not looking

3651
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:48,959
like a very good choice because now

3652
01:55:46,079 --> 01:55:49,760
deutsche coin is bigger than litecoin um

3653
01:55:48,960 --> 01:55:53,118
but

3654
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:53,760
um you know if there's potentially some

3655
01:55:53,118 --> 01:55:57,359
way for

3656
01:55:53,760 --> 01:55:59,360
dogecoin to merge mine within ethereum

3657
01:55:57,359 --> 01:56:00,639
proof of stake ins of some kinds then

3658
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:02,799
like that could be an interesting

3659
01:56:00,639 --> 01:56:05,679
alternative um

3660
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:06,480
if so that's one type of like chain

3661
01:56:05,679 --> 01:56:08,239
interaction

3662
01:56:06,479 --> 01:56:09,519
as far as like bridges like one chain

3663
01:56:08,238 --> 01:56:11,039
reading another chain

3664
01:56:09,520 --> 01:56:12,880
early in ethereum's history there was

3665
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:14,639
this project called btc relay

3666
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:16,960
it's a smart contract on ethereum that

3667
01:56:14,639 --> 01:56:19,760
just verifies bitcoin blocks

3668
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:21,118
i think people stopped really caring

3669
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:22,320
about and maintaining it because there

3670
01:56:21,118 --> 01:56:24,238
just weren't enough

3671
01:56:22,319 --> 01:56:25,679
applications that were actually

3672
01:56:24,238 --> 01:56:27,598
interested in using it at the time and

3673
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:29,039
the transaction fees got too high to

3674
01:56:27,599 --> 01:56:32,079
actually maintain it

3675
01:56:29,039 --> 01:56:33,279
so i i think if we want to make a btc

3676
01:56:32,079 --> 01:56:35,279
relay 2.0

3677
01:56:33,279 --> 01:56:36,800
and that becomes cheaper because you

3678
01:56:35,279 --> 01:56:38,238
know it uses snarks or something like

3679
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:40,880
that then you probably could

3680
01:56:38,238 --> 01:56:41,519
but and maybe now is the time when you

3681
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:43,118
actually

3682
01:56:41,520 --> 01:56:45,280
like can do that sort of one-way

3683
01:56:43,118 --> 01:56:46,079
verification but the one challenge

3684
01:56:45,279 --> 01:56:48,158
though is that

3685
01:56:46,079 --> 01:56:49,840
if he wants to have a bridge that allows

3686
01:56:48,158 --> 01:56:51,359
you to move assets between chins

3687
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:52,560
then you don't just need one-way

3688
01:56:51,359 --> 01:56:53,679
verification you need two-way

3689
01:56:52,560 --> 01:56:55,440
verification

3690
01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:57,118
right and ethereum can verify anything

3691
01:56:55,439 --> 01:56:58,799
because ethereum smart contracts can

3692
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:01,679
just run arbitrary code

3693
01:56:58,800 --> 01:57:03,520
but if you want bitcoin to be able to do

3694
01:57:01,679 --> 01:57:05,118
things based on what happens in ethereum

3695
01:57:03,520 --> 01:57:06,159
lands then like bitcoin would have to

3696
01:57:05,118 --> 01:57:07,439
basically

3697
01:57:06,158 --> 01:57:09,359
well they can do everything with soft

3698
01:57:07,439 --> 01:57:10,000
forks because like you know that that's

3699
01:57:09,359 --> 01:57:12,479
their religion

3700
01:57:10,000 --> 01:57:14,399
but no they'll they'll do it that way

3701
01:57:12,479 --> 01:57:17,279
and if doge wants to

3702
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:17,839
make a fork where that allow allows for

3703
01:57:17,279 --> 01:57:20,319
like

3704
01:57:17,840 --> 01:57:21,520
two-way transferability with the

3705
01:57:20,319 --> 01:57:22,960
ethereum then you know

3706
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:25,840
they could i mean i i think that would

3707
01:57:22,960 --> 01:57:27,840
be a lovely collaboration to make if

3708
01:57:25,840 --> 01:57:29,119
there's interest i think there might

3709
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:32,400
actually even be

3710
01:57:29,118 --> 01:57:35,279
some multi-sig funds that have some um

3711
01:57:32,399 --> 01:57:37,279
some funding it's just a bounty for

3712
01:57:35,279 --> 01:57:39,679
someone to make a bridge between the two

3713
01:57:37,279 --> 01:57:41,519
yeah could you maybe try to

3714
01:57:39,679 --> 01:57:42,639
psychoanalyze elon musk for a brief

3715
01:57:41,520 --> 01:57:46,000
second

3716
01:57:42,639 --> 01:57:48,079
so what are your thoughts about tesla

3717
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,000
and elon musk's journey through the

3718
01:57:48,079 --> 01:57:51,920
cryptocurrency world

3719
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,118
so first with bitcoin and then with

3720
01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:55,840
doshcoin

3721
01:57:53,118 --> 01:57:57,359
so acquiring a large acquiring holding a

3722
01:57:55,840 --> 01:58:00,719
large amount of bitcoin

3723
01:57:57,359 --> 01:58:02,719
and i believe at least considering the

3724
01:58:00,719 --> 01:58:04,560
acquiring and holding a large amount of

3725
01:58:02,719 --> 01:58:06,480
doshcoin positives

3726
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:08,159
negatives what do you think the future

3727
01:58:06,479 --> 01:58:10,000
for tesla and spacex

3728
01:58:08,158 --> 01:58:11,920
in the cryptocurrency space looks like

3729
01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:14,960
do you think they'll consider ethereum

3730
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:15,760
um i'm i'm sure that if you know that

3731
01:58:14,960 --> 01:58:17,920
they stay in

3732
01:58:15,760 --> 01:58:21,840
the the cryptocurrency ecosystem at all

3733
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:21,840
then they have to at some point

3734
01:58:21,920 --> 01:58:28,079
yeah you know bitcoin number one

3735
01:58:25,118 --> 01:58:29,359
dogecoin number i mean you know come on

3736
01:58:28,079 --> 01:58:31,840
it deserves to be number three

3737
01:58:29,359 --> 01:58:33,118
and then or number two and then ethereum

3738
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:37,520
can be whatever that uh

3739
01:58:33,118 --> 01:58:41,679
whatever that other number is um but um

3740
01:58:37,520 --> 01:58:44,159
the if ethereum only becomes a dot

3741
01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:45,039
coin somehow maybe change the logo to

3742
01:58:44,158 --> 01:58:47,839
incorporate

3743
01:58:45,039 --> 01:58:48,238
a dog of some sort almost like doors

3744
01:58:47,840 --> 01:58:51,199
like

3745
01:58:48,238 --> 01:58:52,718
uh sneaking behind oh that would be that

3746
01:58:51,198 --> 01:58:53,039
would be fascinating before the emerge

3747
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:56,319
happened

3748
01:58:53,039 --> 01:58:58,399
and i think like elon you definitely

3749
01:58:56,319 --> 01:58:59,519
i think you would make a mistake if you

3750
01:58:58,399 --> 01:59:02,158
were to kind of

3751
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:03,840
ascribe too much like sophisticated

3752
01:59:02,158 --> 01:59:06,399
malevolent ins or or

3753
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:07,199
any intel like deep intentionality to

3754
01:59:06,399 --> 01:59:09,359
the whole process

3755
01:59:07,198 --> 01:59:11,359
i think like he's just a human being and

3756
01:59:09,359 --> 01:59:11,679
he likes dogs just like i like dogs yeah

3757
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:13,598
right

3758
01:59:11,679 --> 01:59:15,359
that is i think that is literally the

3759
01:59:13,599 --> 01:59:16,159
reasoning behind the whole dose dogecoin

3760
01:59:15,359 --> 01:59:18,719
thing

3761
01:59:16,158 --> 01:59:20,079
there is some aspect to which i mean the

3762
01:59:18,719 --> 01:59:23,679
guy

3763
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:25,760
helped launch a car into space

3764
01:59:23,679 --> 01:59:27,440
right like you could you could ask like

3765
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:30,800
what is the purpose of that

3766
01:59:27,439 --> 01:59:33,279
i think the purpose of that is uh fun

3767
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:34,239
there i think he truly is more and more

3768
01:59:33,279 --> 01:59:36,800
especially

3769
01:59:34,238 --> 01:59:38,000
lately embodying the whole idea that the

3770
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:39,920
most

3771
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:42,238
the most entertaining outcome is the

3772
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:44,000
most likely and he's fully embracing the

3773
01:59:42,238 --> 01:59:46,158
most entertaining outcome

3774
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:48,158
and in many ways dogecoin is the most

3775
01:59:46,158 --> 01:59:50,238
entertaining cryptocurrency

3776
01:59:48,158 --> 01:59:51,839
as cryptocurrency becomes more and more

3777
01:59:50,238 --> 01:59:53,359
impactful in the world

3778
01:59:51,840 --> 01:59:55,039
people are getting more and more serious

3779
01:59:53,359 --> 01:59:56,960
about it and so he's selecting the

3780
01:59:55,039 --> 01:59:59,198
cryptocurrency that is the most the

3781
01:59:56,960 --> 02:00:01,679
least serious and the most fun

3782
01:59:59,198 --> 02:00:02,399
and there's something to that uh like

3783
02:00:01,679 --> 02:00:06,079
coupling

3784
02:00:02,399 --> 02:00:08,319
fun with uh technological sophistication

3785
02:00:06,079 --> 02:00:10,319
um and somehow figuring out a way to do

3786
02:00:08,319 --> 02:00:10,639
that absolutely you do that well you

3787
02:00:10,319 --> 02:00:12,639
know i

3788
02:00:10,639 --> 02:00:15,760
i i want the world to be fun i think the

3789
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:15,760
world being fun is great

3790
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:19,679
okay let me ask about a couple other

3791
02:00:18,079 --> 02:00:21,920
technologies if it's okay

3792
02:00:19,679 --> 02:00:24,239
sure what are your thoughts about chain

3793
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:28,480
link and hybrid smart contracts that

3794
02:00:24,238 --> 02:00:31,359
utilize off-chain external data sources

3795
02:00:28,479 --> 02:00:33,198
and i think it's definitely necessary

3796
02:00:31,359 --> 02:00:35,519
for smart contracts so that

3797
02:00:33,198 --> 02:00:37,118
you do a lot of things to use off chain

3798
02:00:35,520 --> 02:00:38,560
data of some kind right like

3799
02:00:37,118 --> 02:00:39,920
if you want to have a stable coin you

3800
02:00:38,560 --> 02:00:41,119
need a price oracle so you know what

3801
02:00:39,920 --> 02:00:43,760
price you're targeting

3802
02:00:41,118 --> 02:00:46,158
um if he wants to have some fancy you

3803
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,560
know crop insurance gadget like i always

3804
02:00:46,158 --> 02:00:48,079
you know

3805
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:50,159
i think ether risk has been doing a lot

3806
02:00:48,079 --> 02:00:52,719
of uh good work with that in

3807
02:00:50,158 --> 02:00:54,399
i think it was either kenya or sri lanka

3808
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:56,000
or both like they're they're making a

3809
02:00:54,399 --> 02:00:58,158
lot of

3810
02:00:56,000 --> 02:00:59,118
good progress and some in some of those

3811
02:00:58,158 --> 02:01:00,799
places

3812
02:00:59,118 --> 02:01:02,799
like you need some kind of oracle to

3813
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:04,239
tell you you know did it actually rain

3814
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:06,800
in this particular area

3815
02:01:04,238 --> 02:01:08,479
um if he wants to have like assets that

3816
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:09,199
mirror other financial assets you need

3817
02:01:08,479 --> 02:01:10,479
an oracle

3818
02:01:09,198 --> 02:01:12,719
if you want to have a prediction market

3819
02:01:10,479 --> 02:01:15,759
you need an oracle and

3820
02:01:12,719 --> 02:01:18,319
so projects that provide oracles are

3821
02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:19,840
definitely really important and there

3822
02:01:18,319 --> 02:01:21,759
are definitely different kinds of use

3823
02:01:19,840 --> 02:01:22,319
cases like augur is more about you know

3824
02:01:21,760 --> 02:01:24,560
events

3825
02:01:22,319 --> 02:01:26,000
and the auger oracle is designed like i

3826
02:01:24,560 --> 02:01:27,119
think differently from chain link right

3827
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:29,198
like chain link

3828
02:01:27,118 --> 02:01:31,198
emphasizes the whole you know like we

3829
02:01:29,198 --> 02:01:32,559
have a fast automated

3830
02:01:31,198 --> 02:01:34,879
thing that just like gives you data

3831
02:01:32,560 --> 02:01:36,320
quickly um whereas auger

3832
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:38,000
is more you know we don't give a crap

3833
02:01:36,319 --> 02:01:39,359
about speed um

3834
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,639
and look we don't need to give a crap

3835
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:42,238
about speed because if you want to get

3836
02:01:40,639 --> 02:01:42,960
your money out on a prediction market

3837
02:01:42,238 --> 02:01:44,399
that where

3838
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:46,079
in reality it's resolved you can

3839
02:01:44,399 --> 02:01:47,198
probably just sell your coins for 99

3840
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:50,639
cents anyway

3841
02:01:47,198 --> 02:01:52,319
um so i mean i i think i mean the chain

3842
02:01:50,639 --> 02:01:55,920
link is definitely like

3843
02:01:52,319 --> 02:01:58,799
taking a yeah good and the important

3844
02:01:55,920 --> 02:02:00,800
part of the oracle design space and i'm

3845
02:01:58,800 --> 02:02:02,960
definitely happy that there is like

3846
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:04,000
that project taking the task on and at

3847
02:02:02,960 --> 02:02:05,599
the same time i do think

3848
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:07,039
that you know their their frog army on

3849
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:07,840
twitter can get a bit intense sometimes

3850
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:10,000
but like frog

3851
02:02:07,840 --> 02:02:11,679
army is there is there a way to

3852
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:12,238
incorporate sort of oracle network type

3853
02:02:11,679 --> 02:02:15,920
of

3854
02:02:12,238 --> 02:02:17,839
ideas into ethereum i personally

3855
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:19,279
would prefer the ethereum base layer

3856
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:20,960
like

3857
02:02:19,279 --> 02:02:22,559
stay away from trying to provide too

3858
02:02:20,960 --> 02:02:25,359
much functionality because

3859
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:25,920
i think once you have the ethereum base

3860
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:29,118
layer

3861
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:32,480
making a claim about like say the us

3862
02:02:29,118 --> 02:02:34,000
dollar to ethereum price like and

3863
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:35,598
at some sense you're basically saying

3864
02:02:34,000 --> 02:02:38,639
that like ethereum as a

3865
02:02:35,599 --> 02:02:40,000
base platform starts making what could

3866
02:02:38,639 --> 02:02:41,760
be geopolitical statements

3867
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:43,279
right right like for example you know

3868
02:02:41,760 --> 02:02:45,280
imagine if there was some

3869
02:02:43,279 --> 02:02:46,639
you know civil war in the us split up

3870
02:02:45,279 --> 02:02:48,158
and you had two currencies that both

3871
02:02:46,639 --> 02:02:50,239
claims to be the us dollar well

3872
02:02:48,158 --> 02:02:51,920
you know ethereum would would have to

3873
02:02:50,238 --> 02:02:53,598
pick one for the sake of everyone who's

3874
02:02:51,920 --> 02:02:55,039
already using that oracle so you know

3875
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:55,599
does that mean that the blockchain would

3876
02:02:55,039 --> 02:02:58,079
be

3877
02:02:55,599 --> 02:02:59,360
like taking a position in this big

3878
02:02:58,079 --> 02:03:02,880
megapolitical debate

3879
02:02:59,359 --> 02:03:03,519
so i think like for the just those kinds

3880
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:07,118
of reasons

3881
02:03:03,520 --> 02:03:09,760
i would personally like prefer um

3882
02:03:07,118 --> 02:03:10,238
ethereum itself to be more of this sort

3883
02:03:09,760 --> 02:03:12,560
of

3884
02:03:10,238 --> 02:03:14,000
pure platform that just analyzes the

3885
02:03:12,560 --> 02:03:16,960
transactions and just

3886
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:18,399
mathematically using uh deterministic

3887
02:03:16,960 --> 02:03:20,158
consensus rules and then if you need the

3888
02:03:18,399 --> 02:03:24,238
oracles that can be all your tears

3889
02:03:20,158 --> 02:03:26,238
i think ethereum benefits from

3890
02:03:24,238 --> 02:03:28,479
not trying to do everything at layer one

3891
02:03:26,238 --> 02:03:29,759
and having this like very robust way or

3892
02:03:28,479 --> 02:03:31,198
two ecosystem where you have all these

3893
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:33,199
projects doing interesting things

3894
02:03:31,198 --> 02:03:35,759
yeah focus on the basic technology avoid

3895
02:03:33,198 --> 02:03:39,598
the politics gotcha

3896
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:39,599
let me ask a bit of a human question

3897
02:03:40,238 --> 02:03:43,678
charles hoskinson someone you've worked

3898
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:46,158
with

3899
02:03:43,679 --> 02:03:48,639
in the early days of ethereum there

3900
02:03:46,158 --> 02:03:51,198
appears to my outsider view

3901
02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:52,239
to have been a bit of a falling out is

3902
02:03:51,198 --> 02:03:54,799
there a positive

3903
02:03:52,238 --> 02:03:58,319
inspiring human story to be told about

3904
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:58,320
why you two parted ways

3905
02:03:59,439 --> 02:04:03,598
i kind of wants to let the various books

3906
02:04:01,599 --> 02:04:07,199
about ethereum speak for themselves

3907
02:04:03,599 --> 02:04:10,159
um but you know you know if i feel like

3908
02:04:07,198 --> 02:04:11,279
you know since that time i think you

3909
02:04:10,158 --> 02:04:15,359
know charles has

3910
02:04:11,279 --> 02:04:17,359
clearly progressed and then he

3911
02:04:15,359 --> 02:04:19,118
matured in a lot of ways and i mean

3912
02:04:17,359 --> 02:04:20,880
people who follow charles

3913
02:04:19,118 --> 02:04:22,639
closely have definitely told me that you

3914
02:04:20,880 --> 02:04:22,960
know like 2021 charles is very different

3915
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:25,599
from

3916
02:04:22,960 --> 02:04:26,078
2014 charles and i'm sure 2021 vitalik

3917
02:04:25,599 --> 02:04:28,560
is much

3918
02:04:26,078 --> 02:04:29,439
different from 2014 metallic as well i'm

3919
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:32,400
kind of interested

3920
02:04:29,439 --> 02:04:33,839
how the 2030 and 2040 vitalik and

3921
02:04:32,399 --> 02:04:36,238
charles look like as well

3922
02:04:33,840 --> 02:04:37,279
oh interesting like the progression of

3923
02:04:36,238 --> 02:04:39,039
the humans

3924
02:04:37,279 --> 02:04:40,559
is this going to be one of those things

3925
02:04:39,039 --> 02:04:42,399
where like everyone comes full circle

3926
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,119
and then 2030 vitalik and charles are

3927
02:04:42,399 --> 02:04:45,519
best friends

3928
02:04:43,118 --> 02:04:46,799
yeah i mean not necessarily best friends

3929
02:04:45,520 --> 02:04:51,199
but some kind of

3930
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:52,639
uh um are able to reminisce in ways that

3931
02:04:51,198 --> 02:04:54,319
is um

3932
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:56,000
that puts some of the tension of the

3933
02:04:54,319 --> 02:04:59,279
past behind i think

3934
02:04:56,000 --> 02:05:01,840
such things are possible um i think

3935
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:02,719
you know people definitely absolutely

3936
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:05,279
have a right to

3937
02:05:02,719 --> 02:05:06,560
and uh and they should strive to just

3938
02:05:05,279 --> 02:05:07,519
constantly change and reinvent

3939
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:10,079
themselves

3940
02:05:07,520 --> 02:05:12,159
um is there something you could say

3941
02:05:10,078 --> 02:05:12,960
about your thoughts about the cardano

3942
02:05:12,158 --> 02:05:17,118
project

3943
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:20,480
that charles hoskinson leads they've

3944
02:05:17,118 --> 02:05:22,559
worked on some interesting ideas that

3945
02:05:20,479 --> 02:05:24,238
mirror some of the ideas in ethereum

3946
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:28,000
proof of stake

3947
02:05:24,238 --> 02:05:28,959
working on smart contracts and all those

3948
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:31,359
kinds of things

3949
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:32,960
is there something again positive

3950
02:05:31,359 --> 02:05:34,559
inspiring that you could say

3951
02:05:32,960 --> 02:05:36,880
are they a competitor is it

3952
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:38,480
complementary technology

3953
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:40,239
it's uh and there's definitely

3954
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:41,118
interesting ideas in there i mean i do

3955
02:05:40,238 --> 02:05:43,279
think cardano

3956
02:05:41,118 --> 02:05:44,960
takes a bit of a different approach than

3957
02:05:43,279 --> 02:05:46,639
ethereum and that you know they really

3958
02:05:44,960 --> 02:05:49,520
emphasize having these big

3959
02:05:46,639 --> 02:05:51,679
academic proofs for everything whereas

3960
02:05:49,520 --> 02:05:53,599
ethereum tends to be more okay with

3961
02:05:51,679 --> 02:05:55,520
heuristic arguments and in part because

3962
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:58,800
it's just trying to do more faster

3963
02:05:55,520 --> 02:06:00,560
um but you know there's definitely very

3964
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:03,679
interesting things that come out of

3965
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:05,679
you know iohk research and so is there

3966
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:07,279
can you comment on that kind of idea i

3967
02:06:05,679 --> 02:06:09,679
as sort of uh

3968
02:06:07,279 --> 02:06:12,078
having a foot in research enjoy

3969
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:15,118
charles's kind of emphasis on papers

3970
02:06:12,078 --> 02:06:16,158
and like deep academic rigor is there

3971
02:06:15,118 --> 02:06:19,279
what's the role

3972
02:06:16,158 --> 02:06:20,479
of deep research rigor in the world of

3973
02:06:19,279 --> 02:06:21,759
cryptocurrency

3974
02:06:20,479 --> 02:06:23,039
interesting i'm actually the sort of

3975
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:24,639
person who thinks deep rigor is

3976
02:06:23,039 --> 02:06:26,639
overrated

3977
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:28,960
um the reason why i think deep rigor is

3978
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:32,239
overrated is because i think like

3979
02:06:28,960 --> 02:06:32,719
the the in terms of like why protocols

3980
02:06:32,238 --> 02:06:35,759
fail

3981
02:06:32,719 --> 02:06:37,439
i think the number of failures or that

3982
02:06:35,760 --> 02:06:37,920
are outside the model is even more

3983
02:06:37,439 --> 02:06:39,279
important

3984
02:06:37,920 --> 02:06:41,359
is like bigger and more important than

3985
02:06:39,279 --> 02:06:43,118
the failures that are inside the model

3986
02:06:41,359 --> 02:06:44,399
right so if you take selfish mining for

3987
02:06:43,118 --> 02:06:47,359
example like the

3988
02:06:44,399 --> 02:06:49,679
the that original discovery from 2013

3989
02:06:47,359 --> 02:06:52,799
that showed how

3990
02:06:49,679 --> 02:06:55,520
um bitcoin does

3991
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:57,279
like even if it has a 50 uh fault

3992
02:06:55,520 --> 02:06:58,000
tolerance assuming everyone's honest it

3993
02:06:57,279 --> 02:07:00,639
only has a

3994
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:02,078
yeah you know zero to 33 percent fault

3995
02:07:00,639 --> 02:07:02,719
tolerance depending on your network

3996
02:07:02,078 --> 02:07:05,920
model

3997
02:07:02,719 --> 02:07:07,920
if you assume uh rational actors and

3998
02:07:05,920 --> 02:07:09,520
like to me that wasn't that was a great

3999
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:10,719
example of like an outside the model

4000
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:13,040
failure right because

4001
02:07:10,719 --> 02:07:13,760
traditional consensus research just up

4002
02:07:13,039 --> 02:07:16,319
until

4003
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:16,960
or before the blockchain days did not

4004
02:07:16,319 --> 02:07:19,279
think about

4005
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:20,719
like incentivization much right like

4006
02:07:19,279 --> 02:07:22,399
there was a little bit of thought about

4007
02:07:20,719 --> 02:07:23,920
incentivization there's like

4008
02:07:22,399 --> 02:07:25,598
a couple of papers on the byzantine

4009
02:07:23,920 --> 02:07:27,440
altruist rational model but

4010
02:07:25,599 --> 02:07:29,360
it wasn't that deep it was mostly

4011
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:30,719
operating under the assumption that

4012
02:07:29,359 --> 02:07:32,960
you know this we're going to make

4013
02:07:30,719 --> 02:07:34,560
consensus between 15 participants and

4014
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:36,480
these are institutions

4015
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:38,159
and if something goes wrong then you

4016
02:07:36,479 --> 02:07:39,839
know if it was we can figure out

4017
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:41,039
whether or not it was deliberate offline

4018
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:41,920
and if they did something evil we

4019
02:07:41,039 --> 02:07:43,679
consume them

4020
02:07:41,920 --> 02:07:45,359
whereas in the crypto world you can't do

4021
02:07:43,679 --> 02:07:47,279
that right and so

4022
02:07:45,359 --> 02:07:48,719
like that whole discovery basically

4023
02:07:47,279 --> 02:07:50,719
arose just because

4024
02:07:48,719 --> 02:07:52,960
like you know the model of uh

4025
02:07:50,719 --> 02:07:54,719
traditional uh consensus research just

4026
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:55,279
like didn't cover those possibilities

4027
02:07:54,719 --> 02:07:57,039
and then

4028
02:07:55,279 --> 02:07:58,319
like once you go out of the model those

4029
02:07:57,039 --> 02:08:01,118
other issues do exist

4030
02:07:58,319 --> 02:08:01,439
right um so but then at the same time

4031
02:08:01,118 --> 02:08:03,920
like

4032
02:08:01,439 --> 02:08:05,039
there definitely are um protocols that

4033
02:08:03,920 --> 02:08:07,599
turn out to be

4034
02:08:05,039 --> 02:08:09,439
insecu that do have failures inside the

4035
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:10,400
model like this reminds me of at the

4036
02:08:09,439 --> 02:08:14,559
time when

4037
02:08:10,399 --> 02:08:16,799
i think i found a bug in a proposed uh

4038
02:08:14,560 --> 02:08:18,079
consensus implementation from either

4039
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:21,119
bitshares or eos

4040
02:08:18,078 --> 02:08:23,359
this happened around the end of 2017. um

4041
02:08:21,118 --> 02:08:24,319
so that was definitely inside the model

4042
02:08:23,359 --> 02:08:25,679
because like they had

4043
02:08:24,319 --> 02:08:27,039
a very clear idea of what they were

4044
02:08:25,679 --> 02:08:27,840
trying to achieve they had a very clear

4045
02:08:27,039 --> 02:08:29,279
description

4046
02:08:27,840 --> 02:08:31,039
and like there's a very clear

4047
02:08:29,279 --> 02:08:32,238
mathematical um argument for why the

4048
02:08:31,039 --> 02:08:34,078
description doesn't lead to what they're

4049
02:08:32,238 --> 02:08:35,678
trying to achieve but ultimately

4050
02:08:34,078 --> 02:08:37,599
what you're trying to achieve can never

4051
02:08:35,679 --> 02:08:38,560
be fully like described in formal

4052
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:41,199
language right like

4053
02:08:38,560 --> 02:08:43,119
i think this is the big discovery of you

4054
02:08:41,198 --> 02:08:43,919
know the ai safety people for example

4055
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:47,359
right like

4056
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:49,679
just having a a specification of what

4057
02:08:47,359 --> 02:08:52,639
you want is an insanely hard problem

4058
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:54,078
and like the more powerful the optimizer

4059
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:55,760
that you're giving the instructions to

4060
02:08:54,078 --> 02:08:59,279
the more you have to be careful

4061
02:08:55,760 --> 02:09:02,560
and and so you know i think

4062
02:08:59,279 --> 02:09:05,679
there are kind of these two sides

4063
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:07,520
and then the other thing is that

4064
02:09:05,679 --> 02:09:08,800
a lot like a lot of the academic

4065
02:09:07,520 --> 02:09:10,719
approach ends up

4066
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:12,960
like basically optimizing for other

4067
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:16,480
people inside of the academic system

4068
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:18,319
and it doesn't really optimize for like

4069
02:09:16,479 --> 02:09:19,839
curious outsiders whereas like i

4070
02:09:18,319 --> 02:09:21,759
personally met like totally optimized

4071
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:23,039
for curious outsiders or at least i feel

4072
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:27,119
like i strive to

4073
02:09:23,039 --> 02:09:30,960
so i guess like that's my case for why

4074
02:09:27,118 --> 02:09:31,359
i like tends to behave in ways that you

4075
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:33,279
know

4076
02:09:31,359 --> 02:09:35,118
occasionally traditional academic types

4077
02:09:33,279 --> 02:09:37,519
criticize as being reckless um

4078
02:09:35,118 --> 02:09:38,158
but i you know on the other hand you

4079
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:40,480
know there's

4080
02:09:38,158 --> 02:09:41,598
i mean there's definitely real benefits

4081
02:09:40,479 --> 02:09:44,799
that come from

4082
02:09:41,599 --> 02:09:47,520
like just taking us

4083
02:09:44,800 --> 02:09:48,960
a rigorous approach especially when you

4084
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:50,960
know you know what the thing that

4085
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:52,960
ex like you know what the specification

4086
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:55,039
is of what you're trying to get

4087
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:56,319
and like you're trying to kind of

4088
02:09:55,039 --> 02:09:58,000
improve your way

4089
02:09:56,319 --> 02:09:59,759
or provide protocols that actually

4090
02:09:58,000 --> 02:10:00,000
provide that like you know exactly what

4091
02:09:59,760 --> 02:10:02,880
you're

4092
02:10:00,000 --> 02:10:04,880
looking for i feel like realistically

4093
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:05,920
you probably wants to do both kinds of

4094
02:10:04,880 --> 02:10:07,359
analysis

4095
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:09,118
and like sometimes even want to do both

4096
02:10:07,359 --> 02:10:09,759
kinds of analysis and stages right like

4097
02:10:09,118 --> 02:10:11,359
you have

4098
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:13,119
you want to do more quick and dirty

4099
02:10:11,359 --> 02:10:14,078
things and even want public feedback on

4100
02:10:13,118 --> 02:10:16,078
the quick and dirty stuff

4101
02:10:14,078 --> 02:10:17,439
and then later on you formalize it more

4102
02:10:16,078 --> 02:10:20,719
and then you get more feedback

4103
02:10:17,439 --> 02:10:23,839
um like in general i guess i feel like

4104
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:26,800
the norms of research in

4105
02:10:23,840 --> 02:10:28,480
the future like the internet has just

4106
02:10:26,800 --> 02:10:29,119
changed so much there's no way that it's

4107
02:10:28,479 --> 02:10:31,198
not going

4108
02:10:29,118 --> 02:10:33,118
and you know it's it's even changed like

4109
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:34,638
collaboration structures and like the

4110
02:10:33,118 --> 02:10:35,359
patterns in which we work with each

4111
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:37,599
other

4112
02:10:35,359 --> 02:10:38,719
there's no way that the correct

4113
02:10:37,599 --> 02:10:40,560
structure for

4114
02:10:38,719 --> 02:10:42,000
club collaborative research is the same

4115
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:45,199
as what it was 15 years ago

4116
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:47,520
but like what combination of these

4117
02:10:45,198 --> 02:10:49,439
existing components and of new ideas it

4118
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:52,000
is like that's something that's you know

4119
02:10:49,439 --> 02:10:52,960
totally legitimate to kind of fight it

4120
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:54,639
out and i think it's

4121
02:10:52,960 --> 02:10:55,920
great that there's different ecosystems

4122
02:10:54,639 --> 02:10:56,880
that have different attitudes to things

4123
02:10:55,920 --> 02:10:58,880
like you know i think

4124
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:01,039
you know there's a big possibility that

4125
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:02,159
you know things that the ethereum

4126
02:11:01,039 --> 02:11:03,599
ways that the ethereum ecosystem

4127
02:11:02,158 --> 02:11:05,359
approaches some problems is totally

4128
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:07,039
wrong and if there's other ecosystems or

4129
02:11:05,359 --> 02:11:08,238
different principles and they can

4130
02:11:07,039 --> 02:11:10,639
do well that's something that we can

4131
02:11:08,238 --> 02:11:11,439
learn from in the spirit of the depth

4132
02:11:10,639 --> 02:11:14,239
first search

4133
02:11:11,439 --> 02:11:15,439
can you comment on ai safety and some

4134
02:11:14,238 --> 02:11:17,279
people are really worried about the

4135
02:11:15,439 --> 02:11:18,399
existential risks of artificial

4136
02:11:17,279 --> 02:11:20,960
intelligence

4137
02:11:18,399 --> 02:11:21,598
is there something you could say that's

4138
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:24,960
uh

4139
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:27,599
hopeful about how we avoid in the same

4140
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:29,679
kind of line of uh reasoning about

4141
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:31,360
creating formal models versus kind of

4142
02:11:29,679 --> 02:11:33,440
looking outside the model into

4143
02:11:31,359 --> 02:11:36,479
what the real world actually is like is

4144
02:11:33,439 --> 02:11:39,598
there some lessons from that we can take

4145
02:11:36,479 --> 02:11:41,759
and map onto the ai safety world where

4146
02:11:39,599 --> 02:11:43,279
the potentials of the technology whether

4147
02:11:41,760 --> 02:11:46,480
it's in autonomous

4148
02:11:43,279 --> 02:11:47,359
uh weapon systems or just the paperclip

4149
02:11:46,479 --> 02:11:50,078
problem

4150
02:11:47,359 --> 02:11:51,759
uh that we can avoid ai destroying the

4151
02:11:50,078 --> 02:11:54,319
world

4152
02:11:51,760 --> 02:11:54,800
so my impression is actually that like

4153
02:11:54,319 --> 02:11:56,880
this is

4154
02:11:54,800 --> 02:11:58,400
more of a kind of faraway impression and

4155
02:11:56,880 --> 02:12:00,000
it could be wrong that it might even be

4156
02:11:58,399 --> 02:12:01,359
that one of the challenges that ai is

4157
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:04,319
not formal enough

4158
02:12:01,359 --> 02:12:06,158
like because ai does is very like

4159
02:12:04,319 --> 02:12:07,279
practitioner oriented right like it's

4160
02:12:06,158 --> 02:12:09,118
all about like hey

4161
02:12:07,279 --> 02:12:10,559
i found a couple of hacks and look i ran

4162
02:12:09,118 --> 02:12:12,399
them and look you know they seem to

4163
02:12:10,560 --> 02:12:15,360
improve classification accuracy from you

4164
02:12:12,399 --> 02:12:18,078
know 0.684 to 0.773

4165
02:12:15,359 --> 02:12:18,639
uh so a lot of the time like there just

4166
02:12:18,078 --> 02:12:20,799
isn't

4167
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:22,639
actual science behind like why this hack

4168
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:24,079
works and why this uh

4169
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:26,078
other hack doesn't work you just sort of

4170
02:12:24,078 --> 02:12:29,679
like trial and error your way into it

4171
02:12:26,078 --> 02:12:31,359
um but and i could see how that approach

4172
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:32,239
works but at the same time like that

4173
02:12:31,359 --> 02:12:34,799
approach is

4174
02:12:32,238 --> 02:12:36,319
not good for legibility for example it's

4175
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:37,760
not good for like understanding what the

4176
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:40,238
heck is actually going on

4177
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:41,920
like how these kinds of systems

4178
02:12:40,238 --> 02:12:45,279
conceivably might fail

4179
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:48,239
like there's even you know a debate on

4180
02:12:45,279 --> 02:12:49,279
like can you take gpt3 like things and

4181
02:12:48,238 --> 02:12:50,559
just scale them up and

4182
02:12:49,279 --> 02:12:52,319
their intelligence will continue to

4183
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:53,840
improve or is there just like

4184
02:12:52,319 --> 02:12:55,519
some types of reasoning that they're

4185
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:57,440
fundamentally bad at and like

4186
02:12:55,520 --> 02:12:58,800
yeah they're not gonna get good at it no

4187
02:12:57,439 --> 02:13:00,000
matter how much you like scale this

4188
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:01,199
exact same approach and add more

4189
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,800
hardware to it

4190
02:13:01,198 --> 02:13:06,559
so having like

4191
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:08,159
thinking about what's going on more

4192
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:09,119
explicitly i mean my understanding is

4193
02:13:08,158 --> 02:13:12,000
that a big part of

4194
02:13:09,118 --> 02:13:12,880
a ai safety research is trying to do

4195
02:13:12,000 --> 02:13:16,000
that sort of stuff

4196
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:19,039
right and formalize yeah formalize

4197
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:21,118
try to improve just ai legibility

4198
02:13:19,039 --> 02:13:23,118
like trying to understand you know if

4199
02:13:21,118 --> 02:13:24,399
the ai makes some classification so we

4200
02:13:23,118 --> 02:13:26,479
can actually see

4201
02:13:24,399 --> 02:13:27,598
like what happens and what's going on in

4202
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:30,000
the middle right

4203
02:13:27,599 --> 02:13:30,800
whereas with crypto or with traditional

4204
02:13:30,000 --> 02:13:33,520
cryptography

4205
02:13:30,800 --> 02:13:34,239
you know it's like very much not well

4206
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:35,679
okay i mean

4207
02:13:34,238 --> 02:13:37,039
i shouldn't quite say that it's

4208
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:39,039
traditional cryptography is this

4209
02:13:37,039 --> 02:13:40,158
interesting mix of being very formal and

4210
02:13:39,039 --> 02:13:43,359
being very informal

4211
02:13:40,158 --> 02:13:45,039
because it's very formal with given

4212
02:13:43,359 --> 02:13:46,559
these security assumptions prove that

4213
02:13:45,039 --> 02:13:47,359
the protocol works under these security

4214
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:49,119
assumptions

4215
02:13:47,359 --> 02:13:50,880
the places where it's very informal is

4216
02:13:49,118 --> 02:13:52,238
like well how do we even know that there

4217
02:13:50,880 --> 02:13:53,359
isn't an efficient algorithm for

4218
02:13:52,238 --> 02:13:55,839
factoring numbers

4219
02:13:53,359 --> 02:13:56,479
yeah we kind of tried it for 40 years

4220
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:58,239
and then

4221
02:13:56,479 --> 02:14:00,238
you know so far no one's found anything

4222
02:13:58,238 --> 02:14:02,000
better than the gen general number field

4223
02:14:00,238 --> 02:14:03,118
sieve and like okay fine we'll just

4224
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:04,960
assume it's fine

4225
02:14:03,118 --> 02:14:06,960
you know how do we know you can't i'm

4226
02:14:04,960 --> 02:14:08,960
gonna find uh the the discrete log

4227
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:11,279
between two elliptic curve points like

4228
02:14:08,960 --> 02:14:12,800
no did it a couple of decades no one's

4229
02:14:11,279 --> 02:14:14,719
found anything

4230
02:14:12,800 --> 02:14:17,279
faster than like baby step giant step

4231
02:14:14,719 --> 02:14:20,639
stuff uh so

4232
02:14:17,279 --> 02:14:23,679
that's and like

4233
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:25,359
there's there's a there's definitely uh

4234
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:27,279
ways in which that approach really makes

4235
02:14:25,359 --> 02:14:28,719
sense right because at least you can

4236
02:14:27,279 --> 02:14:31,039
concentrate your analysis

4237
02:14:28,719 --> 02:14:32,560
on a small number of building blocks and

4238
02:14:31,039 --> 02:14:33,840
like you know you do have some intuitive

4239
02:14:32,560 --> 02:14:34,639
reasoning about those building blocks

4240
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:35,920
but like at least

4241
02:14:34,639 --> 02:14:37,359
there's a small number of building

4242
02:14:35,920 --> 02:14:37,920
blocks and lots of people are looking at

4243
02:14:37,359 --> 02:14:39,359
them

4244
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:40,880
and then everything else just sort of

4245
02:14:39,359 --> 02:14:41,679
gets formally built on top and you

4246
02:14:40,880 --> 02:14:43,440
actually can

4247
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:45,520
like mathematically reduce the security

4248
02:14:43,439 --> 02:14:47,759
of big thanks to building blocks right

4249
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:48,560
like you can have mathematical proofs

4250
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:51,920
that say

4251
02:14:48,560 --> 02:14:53,599
you know if you make a zk snark of a yes

4252
02:14:51,920 --> 02:14:54,480
statement when in reality that statement

4253
02:14:53,599 --> 02:14:57,760
is false

4254
02:14:54,479 --> 02:14:59,919
then you can use that to like

4255
02:14:57,760 --> 02:15:01,199
extract information out of elliptic

4256
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:02,399
curves that you know it completely

4257
02:15:01,198 --> 02:15:03,279
breaks the problem or something like

4258
02:15:02,399 --> 02:15:06,000
that

4259
02:15:03,279 --> 02:15:06,960
uh so so zika is an example where

4260
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,840
formalism is

4261
02:15:06,960 --> 02:15:10,960
is beneficial absolutely yeah and so

4262
02:15:09,840 --> 02:15:13,279
maybe you can have the same kind of

4263
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:16,158
stuff in the ai safety within

4264
02:15:13,279 --> 02:15:18,238
within ai systems that you can get get a

4265
02:15:16,158 --> 02:15:19,679
hold of some kind of

4266
02:15:18,238 --> 02:15:21,279
aspect of the systems that you can

4267
02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:23,039
control right provably

4268
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:24,319
and then in blockchains and

4269
02:15:23,039 --> 02:15:26,639
cryptocurrency i

4270
02:15:24,319 --> 02:15:28,399
think the one area where consensus like

4271
02:15:26,639 --> 02:15:28,960
mechanisms is still more an art than a

4272
02:15:28,399 --> 02:15:30,960
science

4273
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:32,399
is that these aren't just like

4274
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,840
technological systems they're crypto

4275
02:15:32,399 --> 02:15:35,279
economic systems right and they make

4276
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:37,199
assumptions about people

4277
02:15:35,279 --> 02:15:38,559
and which assumptions you can make about

4278
02:15:37,198 --> 02:15:39,519
people is not something that you can

4279
02:15:38,560 --> 02:15:43,280
prove with math

4280
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:45,840
right the even just the basic 51 percent

4281
02:15:43,279 --> 02:15:47,039
exact people are honest can you trust

4282
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:49,520
the 51 percent

4283
02:15:47,039 --> 02:15:51,198
um if you can't trust the 51 can you

4284
02:15:49,520 --> 02:15:54,079
trust the other 49

4285
02:15:51,198 --> 02:15:54,960
to be able to coordinate on like making

4286
02:15:54,078 --> 02:15:56,799
their own fork

4287
02:15:54,960 --> 02:15:58,319
what will happen to coin prices like how

4288
02:15:56,800 --> 02:16:00,320
do people as

4289
02:15:58,319 --> 02:16:01,920
human beings react to these events like

4290
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:03,920
there's all of these assumptions

4291
02:16:01,920 --> 02:16:05,520
yeah but you know at the same time look

4292
02:16:03,920 --> 02:16:06,960
if you can write down the assumptions

4293
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:09,199
then you can like do

4294
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:10,319
formal things with them i almost forgot

4295
02:16:09,198 --> 02:16:12,479
to ask you

4296
02:16:10,319 --> 02:16:14,559
about one of the most exciting aspects

4297
02:16:12,479 --> 02:16:15,279
of ethereum i mean it's non-technical i

4298
02:16:14,560 --> 02:16:18,560
think it's a

4299
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:22,238
it's a societal it's social which is

4300
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:23,760
nfts so what do you think

4301
02:16:22,238 --> 02:16:25,519
what do you think about the explosion of

4302
02:16:23,760 --> 02:16:28,800
nfts in the recent

4303
02:16:25,520 --> 02:16:30,960
months especially in the art world

4304
02:16:28,800 --> 02:16:33,519
and beyond and what does the future look

4305
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:36,398
like so this is maybe

4306
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:38,719
the social impact on the world on on the

4307
02:16:36,398 --> 02:16:40,959
individual creators of all kinds

4308
02:16:38,718 --> 02:16:42,318
like is that something you've actually

4309
02:16:40,959 --> 02:16:45,199
expected to see

4310
02:16:42,318 --> 02:16:46,000
and ft's having this kind of impact and

4311
02:16:45,200 --> 02:16:49,200
beyond

4312
02:16:46,000 --> 02:16:51,679
what do you think will happen in the uh

4313
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:53,599
in the digital space with nfts

4314
02:16:51,679 --> 02:16:55,359
in virtual reality and gaming all those

4315
02:16:53,599 --> 02:16:57,840
kinds of things

4316
02:16:55,359 --> 02:16:58,800
i was definitely surprised by like nfts

4317
02:16:57,840 --> 02:17:01,359
in particular

4318
02:16:58,799 --> 02:17:03,279
like i even actually i think might be on

4319
02:17:01,359 --> 02:17:04,719
record somewhere on some tech conference

4320
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:06,479
panel like they were asking you know

4321
02:17:04,718 --> 02:17:08,398
um it was one of those overrated or

4322
02:17:06,478 --> 02:17:09,199
underrated sections and asked about nfts

4323
02:17:08,398 --> 02:17:10,879
and i thought

4324
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:12,159
and i said like hey i think nfts are

4325
02:17:10,879 --> 02:17:13,679
overrated yeah and you know in

4326
02:17:12,159 --> 02:17:14,239
retrospect that turned out to be quite

4327
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:16,398
wrong

4328
02:17:14,239 --> 02:17:17,519
i might think like i guess i just

4329
02:17:16,398 --> 02:17:20,000
personally

4330
02:17:17,519 --> 02:17:22,159
can't really relate to this concept of

4331
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:25,280
like spending a lot of money on a thing

4332
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:25,840
like there's nothing you know there's no

4333
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:28,479
queer

4334
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:29,599
kind of understanding of why that thing

4335
02:17:28,478 --> 02:17:32,799
would uh

4336
02:17:29,599 --> 02:17:33,599
maintain its value right um uniqueness

4337
02:17:32,799 --> 02:17:36,879
of a thing

4338
02:17:33,599 --> 02:17:39,359
having value right exactly like that's

4339
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:40,799
like i definitely am like cannot really

4340
02:17:39,359 --> 02:17:41,359
understand you know the psychology

4341
02:17:40,799 --> 02:17:42,799
behind

4342
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:44,000
like buying you know paying two hundred

4343
02:17:42,799 --> 02:17:45,358
thousand dollars for original art

4344
02:17:44,000 --> 02:17:46,959
painting i'd be like you know

4345
02:17:45,359 --> 02:17:48,479
if i had a mansion just like give me

4346
02:17:46,959 --> 02:17:50,558
photocopies of everything

4347
02:17:48,478 --> 02:17:52,000
you can hang three photocopies of the

4348
02:17:50,558 --> 02:17:53,438
the mona lisa section

4349
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:54,638
well i would even have the mona lisa i

4350
02:17:53,439 --> 02:17:56,079
think i'd probably just like have some

4351
02:17:54,638 --> 02:17:57,679
nyan cats or something

4352
02:17:56,079 --> 02:17:59,359
that's one thing where mathematics or

4353
02:17:57,679 --> 02:18:01,599
theoretical computer science cannot

4354
02:17:59,359 --> 02:18:02,239
formalize why the heck nfts are valuable

4355
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:05,679
exactly

4356
02:18:02,239 --> 02:18:07,280
but the thing that uh that

4357
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:09,439
makes me very happy about the space now

4358
02:18:07,280 --> 02:18:11,040
that it has happened is that

4359
02:18:09,439 --> 02:18:12,159
i mean this gets back to the

4360
02:18:11,040 --> 02:18:13,760
conversation that we had at the

4361
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:14,959
beginning right like i'm interested in

4362
02:18:13,760 --> 02:18:17,280
this concept of

4363
02:18:14,959 --> 02:18:18,799
decentralized public goods funding right

4364
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:21,519
like i want

4365
02:18:18,799 --> 02:18:23,279
things that are good and valuable to as

4366
02:18:21,519 --> 02:18:25,200
much as possible also be

4367
02:18:23,280 --> 02:18:26,639
things that can't you know economically

4368
02:18:25,200 --> 02:18:28,880
sustain the people who produce them

4369
02:18:26,638 --> 02:18:30,718
right because if you don't have that

4370
02:18:28,879 --> 02:18:31,920
then either the public goods just don't

4371
02:18:30,718 --> 02:18:34,478
get produced at all

4372
02:18:31,920 --> 02:18:36,159
or people make like centralized versions

4373
02:18:34,478 --> 02:18:38,159
that have some of the properties and try

4374
02:18:36,159 --> 02:18:39,840
to be substitutes but actually just like

4375
02:18:38,159 --> 02:18:41,280
concentrate control in a very small

4376
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:42,478
group right

4377
02:18:41,280 --> 02:18:44,479
and you know both of those things are

4378
02:18:42,478 --> 02:18:46,478
not very nice uh so

4379
02:18:44,478 --> 02:18:48,239
the nice thing about nfts would be well

4380
02:18:46,478 --> 02:18:50,159
if you're an artist and you can

4381
02:18:48,239 --> 02:18:51,760
just mint nfts and this is a source of

4382
02:18:50,159 --> 02:18:53,519
revenue it's like great that's another

4383
02:18:51,760 --> 02:18:55,280
stream of revenue for

4384
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:57,200
you know creative work that often does

4385
02:18:55,280 --> 02:18:58,000
still get get underfunded and that's

4386
02:18:57,200 --> 02:18:59,519
amazing

4387
02:18:58,000 --> 02:19:03,439
okay let me ask you a weird question we

4388
02:18:59,519 --> 02:19:03,439
talk about craig wright a little bit but

4389
02:19:03,519 --> 02:19:07,920
a lot of people write to me one of two

4390
02:19:06,318 --> 02:19:11,599
emails

4391
02:19:07,920 --> 02:19:15,200
one email uh is uh

4392
02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:18,239
calling any coin outside of bitcoin a uh

4393
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:19,200
a scam and then the other email is

4394
02:19:18,239 --> 02:19:22,638
saying

4395
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:24,000
my my favorite coin is the best coin

4396
02:19:22,638 --> 02:19:26,079
it's going to save the world whatever

4397
02:19:24,000 --> 02:19:29,040
that coin is

4398
02:19:26,079 --> 02:19:30,000
uh and so i sit back and i look at i

4399
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:32,960
have no idea

4400
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:36,239
i i trust i tried to figure out like the

4401
02:19:32,959 --> 02:19:39,279
humans that i trust in this space

4402
02:19:36,239 --> 02:19:39,760
just but basic human qualities but do

4403
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:43,040
you think

4404
02:19:39,760 --> 02:19:45,200
some coins are scams uh

4405
02:19:43,040 --> 02:19:47,439
do you think some coins maybe another

4406
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:48,640
way to ask it are scammier than other

4407
02:19:47,439 --> 02:19:50,720
coins

4408
02:19:48,639 --> 02:19:51,840
how are people that are looking outside

4409
02:19:50,719 --> 02:19:54,000
of the space where there's

4410
02:19:51,840 --> 02:19:55,280
all these cryptocurrencies supposed to

4411
02:19:54,000 --> 02:19:58,239
figure out

4412
02:19:55,280 --> 02:20:00,000
what is a scam and not or how to use the

4413
02:19:58,239 --> 02:20:01,119
right kind of language when talking

4414
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,799
about them

4415
02:20:01,120 --> 02:20:04,560
because there's the harshness of the

4416
02:20:02,799 --> 02:20:05,279
language from the bitcoin maximalist

4417
02:20:04,559 --> 02:20:07,199
that

4418
02:20:05,280 --> 02:20:08,880
doesn't just say everything is a scam

4419
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:11,439
including ethereum

4420
02:20:08,879 --> 02:20:13,358
uh but they use terms like coin

4421
02:20:11,439 --> 02:20:15,040
that says it's not only a scam it's like

4422
02:20:13,359 --> 02:20:16,960
a waste of time i mean

4423
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:18,319
every word you can use they say that

4424
02:20:16,959 --> 02:20:20,959
that's very harsh

4425
02:20:18,318 --> 02:20:23,039
and then some people are just apply the

4426
02:20:20,959 --> 02:20:26,239
word scam a lit much much

4427
02:20:23,040 --> 02:20:28,240
more conservatively and just refer to

4428
02:20:26,239 --> 02:20:28,799
coins that legitimately are trying to

4429
02:20:28,239 --> 02:20:31,520
scam

4430
02:20:28,799 --> 02:20:33,279
people out of their money as scams so

4431
02:20:31,520 --> 02:20:35,359
what do we do with this word scam should

4432
02:20:33,280 --> 02:20:38,159
it ever be applied to coins

4433
02:20:35,359 --> 02:20:39,840
and uh is it a a binary thing or is it

4434
02:20:38,159 --> 02:20:42,159
the gray area

4435
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:44,159
hmm it's i think it's definitely a gray

4436
02:20:42,159 --> 02:20:46,159
area like there's definitely

4437
02:20:44,159 --> 02:20:47,680
things that are really in actual scams

4438
02:20:46,159 --> 02:20:49,439
like i mean bit connects would be one

4439
02:20:47,680 --> 02:20:50,239
example of uh something that's away on

4440
02:20:49,439 --> 02:20:53,040
the scam

4441
02:20:50,239 --> 02:20:54,959
spectrum did you see their 2017

4442
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:58,080
promotional video by the way

4443
02:20:54,959 --> 02:20:58,879
big connect yeah hey what's up what's up

4444
02:20:58,079 --> 02:21:02,318
what's up

4445
02:20:58,879 --> 02:21:04,639
piconic this is it was this three minute

4446
02:21:02,318 --> 02:21:05,840
48 second video that was just of this

4447
02:21:04,639 --> 02:21:07,840
guy

4448
02:21:05,840 --> 02:21:09,200
making this totally crazy rant and it

4449
02:21:07,840 --> 02:21:11,200
was at some

4450
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:12,319
conference in vietnam where they were of

4451
02:21:11,200 --> 02:21:13,840
course like trying to

4452
02:21:12,318 --> 02:21:15,439
convince a whole bunch of people to buy

4453
02:21:13,840 --> 02:21:17,359
this coin and they had this claims about

4454
02:21:15,439 --> 02:21:19,200
how it would go to go up in value

4455
02:21:17,359 --> 02:21:22,239
yeah that was definitely like the peak

4456
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:22,240
of these pure

4457
02:21:22,959 --> 02:21:27,599
completely scammy coins and you know

4458
02:21:25,920 --> 02:21:28,318
that was definitely really terrible and

4459
02:21:27,600 --> 02:21:30,000
i actually

4460
02:21:28,318 --> 02:21:31,519
i feel like we have less despite

4461
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:33,120
cryptocurrency as a whole being bigger

4462
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:35,200
we actually have

4463
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:36,720
quite a bit less of that now but then of

4464
02:21:35,200 --> 02:21:37,760
course you know there's this bit this

4465
02:21:36,719 --> 02:21:40,079
spectrum

4466
02:21:37,760 --> 02:21:41,680
of things that are not completely scams

4467
02:21:40,079 --> 02:21:43,120
um and then things that are

4468
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:45,200
not scams and that are technically

4469
02:21:43,120 --> 02:21:47,520
totally fine projects but where

4470
02:21:45,200 --> 02:21:48,399
the their community is just incredibly

4471
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:50,399
sketchy

4472
02:21:48,398 --> 02:21:52,478
and then all the way to you know things

4473
02:21:50,398 --> 02:21:53,358
that are where the community is nice but

4474
02:21:52,478 --> 02:21:55,199
maybe the

4475
02:21:53,359 --> 02:21:56,559
project is just fundamentally incapable

4476
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,920
of achieving what it's trying to do or

4477
02:21:56,559 --> 02:21:58,398
in the community doesn't realize and

4478
02:21:57,920 --> 02:22:00,879
then

4479
02:21:58,398 --> 02:22:01,840
you know a really good project right so

4480
02:22:00,879 --> 02:22:04,959
like

4481
02:22:01,840 --> 02:22:07,120
if you want to go a step like

4482
02:22:04,959 --> 02:22:08,000
well if that's 100 scam then like you

4483
02:22:07,120 --> 02:22:10,560
know what would i call

4484
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,079
like say 80 scam well like bitcoin sv is

4485
02:22:10,559 --> 02:22:13,199
one example this is a craig wright's

4486
02:22:12,079 --> 02:22:15,039
fork of bitcoin

4487
02:22:13,200 --> 02:22:16,880
like theoretically it's a blockchain

4488
02:22:15,040 --> 02:22:19,439
right it's a fork of bitcoin

4489
02:22:16,879 --> 02:22:20,079
it has some you know 500 12 megabyte

4490
02:22:19,439 --> 02:22:21,600
blocks

4491
02:22:20,079 --> 02:22:23,200
if you really wanted to you could use

4492
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:24,800
the blockchain you know it's uh

4493
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:26,399
it satisfies the property is that you

4494
02:22:24,799 --> 02:22:29,438
know you can send transactions

4495
02:22:26,398 --> 02:22:30,000
onto it you can probably um you know use

4496
02:22:29,439 --> 02:22:31,680
it as

4497
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:34,159
as a backup to store your files if you

4498
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:36,079
really wanted to just because it has

4499
02:22:34,159 --> 02:22:38,079
it has so much space you know it might

4500
02:22:36,079 --> 02:22:41,920
fail but

4501
02:22:38,079 --> 02:22:43,520
like it's the but at the same time

4502
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:44,960
like you know as they basically said

4503
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:47,680
like craig wright is

4504
02:22:44,959 --> 02:22:49,119
a scammer and like half the you know

4505
02:22:47,680 --> 02:22:51,040
community is just totally bad

4506
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:52,319
insane so the humans

4507
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:54,560
the humans of a particular

4508
02:22:52,318 --> 02:22:56,398
cryptocurrency is what makes for a scam

4509
02:22:54,559 --> 02:22:57,519
and not like the humans at the top that

4510
02:22:56,398 --> 02:22:59,519
have a voice

4511
02:22:57,520 --> 02:23:01,600
right guiding the community yeah like i

4512
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:02,880
think you know in the case of bsv like

4513
02:23:01,600 --> 02:23:05,359
the humans they yeah

4514
02:23:02,879 --> 02:23:06,639
make just completely wrong and just

4515
02:23:05,359 --> 02:23:08,960
obviously

4516
02:23:06,639 --> 02:23:10,398
wrong claims about like what bsv is

4517
02:23:08,959 --> 02:23:11,438
capable of accomplishing and

4518
02:23:10,398 --> 02:23:14,079
like what it concealed we could

4519
02:23:11,439 --> 02:23:15,840
accomplish and like there's just

4520
02:23:14,079 --> 02:23:18,318
a lot of aspects of it that make it feel

4521
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:20,239
like a money grab so that's one example

4522
02:23:18,318 --> 02:23:21,760
and then you know you gotta go a bit

4523
02:23:20,239 --> 02:23:23,359
further and then you know you have like

4524
02:23:21,760 --> 02:23:25,359
the trons of the world

4525
02:23:23,359 --> 02:23:26,640
and like you know that's a platform you

4526
02:23:25,359 --> 02:23:28,720
know you can use it you can do

4527
02:23:26,639 --> 02:23:30,079
you can do stuff on it but at the same

4528
02:23:28,719 --> 02:23:32,398
time like you know

4529
02:23:30,079 --> 02:23:33,680
they did plagiarize the ipfs white paper

4530
02:23:32,398 --> 02:23:35,279
and then

4531
02:23:33,680 --> 02:23:37,520
you know they had so the scammy

4532
02:23:35,280 --> 02:23:39,280
qualities yeah see the thing that throws

4533
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:40,800
me off a lot this makes it very

4534
02:23:39,280 --> 02:23:44,560
difficult for me

4535
02:23:40,799 --> 02:23:46,398
is that most coins but the ones that

4536
02:23:44,559 --> 02:23:49,519
make me feel like are

4537
02:23:46,398 --> 02:23:53,039
scammy have a large community of people

4538
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:56,239
that are super positive about it

4539
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:59,520
like and they'll write to me

4540
02:23:56,239 --> 02:24:00,559
now that said sort of on the flip side

4541
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:04,079
of that

4542
02:24:00,559 --> 02:24:06,159
bitcoin people are also very positive

4543
02:24:04,079 --> 02:24:07,680
there's some sense and the the reason i

4544
02:24:06,159 --> 02:24:09,840
was

4545
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:10,960
having like squinty eyes looking at

4546
02:24:09,840 --> 02:24:13,439
bitcoin

4547
02:24:10,959 --> 02:24:14,079
for quite a while is like why is

4548
02:24:13,439 --> 02:24:17,920
everyone so

4549
02:24:14,079 --> 02:24:21,200
positive i was getting total cult vibes

4550
02:24:17,920 --> 02:24:25,840
like like the ideas are not grounded in

4551
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:27,680
truth but are grounded in an obsession

4552
02:24:25,840 --> 02:24:29,760
of like when you can artificially

4553
02:24:27,680 --> 02:24:31,520
conjure up a truth which is why i was a

4554
02:24:29,760 --> 02:24:33,359
little bit like worried about bitcoin

4555
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:34,880
i think i've learned a lot since then to

4556
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:38,479
where like

4557
02:24:34,879 --> 02:24:39,759
um i i learned to separate the community

4558
02:24:38,478 --> 02:24:41,679
from the ideas

4559
02:24:39,760 --> 02:24:43,840
and i think bitcoin is a revolutionary

4560
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:46,479
idea on on many fronts

4561
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:48,880
but still a community that's like

4562
02:24:46,478 --> 02:24:51,119
dogmatically excited about something

4563
02:24:48,879 --> 02:24:53,519
whatever that is makes me skeptical

4564
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:55,520
maybe it's just like my upbringing

4565
02:24:53,520 --> 02:24:56,880
but when everybody's really excited

4566
02:24:55,520 --> 02:25:00,960
about something

4567
02:24:56,879 --> 02:25:02,879
it makes me um it makes me skeptical

4568
02:25:00,959 --> 02:25:04,478
and it make but it also makes me

4569
02:25:02,879 --> 02:25:05,920
difficult to decide what is this cam or

4570
02:25:04,478 --> 02:25:07,199
not because some of the most exciting

4571
02:25:05,920 --> 02:25:08,478
ideas in this world

4572
02:25:07,200 --> 02:25:11,520
have a community of people who are

4573
02:25:08,478 --> 02:25:13,438
excited about it right because it's um

4574
02:25:11,520 --> 02:25:14,800
i don't know i think space exploration

4575
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:17,520
is super exciting

4576
02:25:14,799 --> 02:25:18,318
and uh and there's people i know a lot

4577
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:20,159
of them that are

4578
02:25:18,318 --> 02:25:21,359
exceptionally excited about space

4579
02:25:20,159 --> 02:25:24,719
exploration

4580
02:25:21,359 --> 02:25:26,239
does that mean it's a scam no no uh

4581
02:25:24,719 --> 02:25:27,920
so i don't know what to do with that and

4582
02:25:26,239 --> 02:25:30,159
so mostly i just try to stay away

4583
02:25:27,920 --> 02:25:31,280
i suppose but it's it's unfortunate

4584
02:25:30,159 --> 02:25:32,719
because i'm sure there's a lot of

4585
02:25:31,280 --> 02:25:34,319
exciting technologies

4586
02:25:32,719 --> 02:25:35,920
in that space i mean like in the case of

4587
02:25:34,318 --> 02:25:39,279
bitcoin like i would definitely not call

4588
02:25:35,920 --> 02:25:41,600
bitcoin as cam right

4589
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:43,280
right i would not i would i would also

4590
02:25:41,600 --> 02:25:45,120
not call litecoin a scam

4591
02:25:43,280 --> 02:25:47,040
there's people who call litecoin scam

4592
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:47,439
because they just like say oh look you

4593
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:49,840
know

4594
02:25:47,439 --> 02:25:52,000
it has no fundamental use case and the

4595
02:25:49,840 --> 02:25:54,159
concept of being silver to bitcoin

4596
02:25:52,000 --> 02:25:55,520
bitcoin's gold is just like stupid and

4597
02:25:54,159 --> 02:25:56,799
you know it's a bit like

4598
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:58,960
millie bitcoin is the silver to

4599
02:25:56,799 --> 02:26:02,398
bitcoin's gold um but

4600
02:25:58,959 --> 02:26:03,679
the at the same time like if you have

4601
02:26:02,398 --> 02:26:05,840
these people who are just

4602
02:26:03,680 --> 02:26:07,040
you know they do seem to earnestly

4603
02:26:05,840 --> 02:26:08,960
believe this and

4604
02:26:07,040 --> 02:26:10,800
uh like they are trying to just like

4605
02:26:08,959 --> 02:26:12,639
make like one be a litecoin as as best

4606
02:26:10,799 --> 02:26:14,159
as they can then like that's

4607
02:26:12,639 --> 02:26:15,920
to me that's enough for it to not be a

4608
02:26:14,159 --> 02:26:19,200
scam yeah um

4609
02:26:15,920 --> 02:26:21,280
that's and then so

4610
02:26:19,200 --> 02:26:23,200
yeah i think the the biggest gray area

4611
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:26,479
is definitely between

4612
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:28,800
like projects that

4613
02:26:26,478 --> 02:26:30,478
are earnest and but you know they have

4614
02:26:28,799 --> 02:26:32,398
just all sorts of these

4615
02:26:30,478 --> 02:26:34,239
like different combinations of flawed

4616
02:26:32,398 --> 02:26:36,239
qualities to them yeah yeah

4617
02:26:34,239 --> 02:26:37,520
i mean the the ones that legitimately is

4618
02:26:36,239 --> 02:26:39,199
a scam is when

4619
02:26:37,520 --> 02:26:42,399
the key people that are at the head of

4620
02:26:39,200 --> 02:26:45,840
the project are intentionally lying

4621
02:26:42,398 --> 02:26:48,398
and i think as long as their the intent

4622
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:49,120
is to try to do good in the world even

4623
02:26:48,398 --> 02:26:50,799
if the

4624
02:26:49,120 --> 02:26:53,359
your actual implementation of that is

4625
02:26:50,799 --> 02:26:54,959
flawed i think that's not a scam

4626
02:26:53,359 --> 02:26:57,920
it could be flawed ideas it could be

4627
02:26:54,959 --> 02:27:00,879
wrong ideas but it's not a scam

4628
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:02,960
i'm learning to navigate this space yeah

4629
02:27:00,879 --> 02:27:06,000
it's definitely a very

4630
02:27:02,959 --> 02:27:07,119
challenging space to navigate i mean you

4631
02:27:06,000 --> 02:27:08,719
know it's uh

4632
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:10,240
in some ways a reflection of the world

4633
02:27:08,719 --> 02:27:12,959
at large

4634
02:27:10,239 --> 02:27:13,680
yeah and as we've said maybe offline

4635
02:27:12,959 --> 02:27:15,519
that

4636
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:17,439
the fact that money is evolved makes it

4637
02:27:15,520 --> 02:27:20,880
a little bit more complicated

4638
02:27:17,439 --> 02:27:24,720
that um you know lives can be ruined

4639
02:27:20,879 --> 02:27:26,318
by um by by the choice of technologies

4640
02:27:24,719 --> 02:27:29,199
that are taking on so

4641
02:27:26,318 --> 02:27:29,519
it makes it more real more painful more

4642
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:32,960
like

4643
02:27:29,520 --> 02:27:35,840
elevated the impact of this like imagine

4644
02:27:32,959 --> 02:27:36,879
like mac versus pc wars if everyone who

4645
02:27:35,840 --> 02:27:39,040
bought a macbook

4646
02:27:36,879 --> 02:27:40,959
had 10 apple shares inside of it and

4647
02:27:39,040 --> 02:27:42,160
everyone who had a pc had 10 microsoft

4648
02:27:40,959 --> 02:27:44,478
shares inside of it

4649
02:27:42,159 --> 02:27:45,280
and then you had you know the the elites

4650
02:27:44,478 --> 02:27:47,599
who bought

4651
02:27:45,280 --> 02:27:48,640
their macs back in 1983 and that they

4652
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:49,920
spent 500

4653
02:27:48,639 --> 02:27:51,840
dead and now they have 40 million

4654
02:27:49,920 --> 02:27:53,680
dollars and they just think that they're

4655
02:27:51,840 --> 02:27:55,920
these gurus who understands the future

4656
02:27:53,680 --> 02:27:58,159
of finance and geopolitics and

4657
02:27:55,920 --> 02:27:59,520
they make theories about why you know

4658
02:27:58,159 --> 02:28:00,639
apple is the one that's going to bring

4659
02:27:59,520 --> 02:28:03,439
freedom to the world

4660
02:28:00,639 --> 02:28:05,039
and uh window is like you know secretly

4661
02:28:03,439 --> 02:28:07,120
allied with the access of evil

4662
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:08,880
oh that's brilliant so yes this is so

4663
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:10,720
brilliant so i think the right way to

4664
02:28:08,879 --> 02:28:12,559
think about this is we map

4665
02:28:10,719 --> 02:28:14,719
the some of the cryptocurrency battles

4666
02:28:12,559 --> 02:28:18,318
into the space of like emacs versus vim

4667
02:28:14,719 --> 02:28:19,840
or apple versus pc if

4668
02:28:18,318 --> 02:28:22,318
there was some stock that came along

4669
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:22,639
with each each implementation of the you

4670
02:28:22,318 --> 02:28:25,519
know

4671
02:28:22,639 --> 02:28:27,439
uh each pc each mac that's fascinating

4672
02:28:25,520 --> 02:28:29,920
this is 100 correct

4673
02:28:27,439 --> 02:28:31,840
100 correct because then that really

4674
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:33,439
energizes the armies of people debating

4675
02:28:31,840 --> 02:28:35,760
over this in a way that

4676
02:28:33,439 --> 02:28:37,280
something without money does not okay

4677
02:28:35,760 --> 02:28:39,600
let me ask you about something

4678
02:28:37,280 --> 02:28:42,479
really fascinating that you are also

4679
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:46,239
excited about which is longevity

4680
02:28:42,478 --> 02:28:50,000
anti-aging you have donated money to the

4681
02:28:46,239 --> 02:28:53,119
sense foundation so you have an interest

4682
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:55,120
in this whole space of lifespan research

4683
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:56,479
what's your vision here or what do you

4684
02:28:55,120 --> 02:28:59,840
hope to see in

4685
02:28:56,478 --> 02:29:03,599
anti-aging and longevity research

4686
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:05,439
i think i hope to see the concept of

4687
02:29:03,600 --> 02:29:07,680
what of us seeing your parents and

4688
02:29:05,439 --> 02:29:09,200
grandparents die just slowly disappear

4689
02:29:07,680 --> 02:29:10,639
from the public consciousness as an

4690
02:29:09,200 --> 02:29:12,640
experience that happens

4691
02:29:10,639 --> 02:29:14,318
over the course of uh half a century the

4692
02:29:12,639 --> 02:29:16,079
same way that getting lost in

4693
02:29:14,318 --> 02:29:17,600
a city slowly disappeared over the

4694
02:29:16,079 --> 02:29:19,600
public consciousness over the last 50

4695
02:29:17,600 --> 02:29:22,000
now that we have smartphones

4696
02:29:19,600 --> 02:29:23,840
the thing you have from nick bostrom the

4697
02:29:22,000 --> 02:29:27,600
essay

4698
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:30,719
uh pinned in your twitter is argues that

4699
02:29:27,600 --> 02:29:33,680
essentially that you know death is

4700
02:29:30,719 --> 02:29:35,519
almost unethical like the fact that we

4701
02:29:33,680 --> 02:29:36,318
don't do something about this thing that

4702
02:29:35,520 --> 02:29:39,040
um

4703
02:29:36,318 --> 02:29:40,159
this in the essays is a dragon that

4704
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:43,359
keeps

4705
02:29:40,159 --> 02:29:46,000
like murdering everybody around us

4706
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:46,640
including our parents and grandparents

4707
02:29:46,000 --> 02:29:48,159
is uh

4708
02:29:46,639 --> 02:29:51,119
like the fact that we don't try to do

4709
02:29:48,159 --> 02:29:55,600
something aggressively about that dragon

4710
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:57,840
is uh doesn't make any sense um

4711
02:29:55,600 --> 02:30:00,159
so you think this is a battle worth

4712
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:01,680
fighting a battle for immortality or at

4713
02:30:00,159 --> 02:30:03,680
least longevity

4714
02:30:01,680 --> 02:30:04,800
i'd say absolutely and i'd say it's a

4715
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:08,318
battle where

4716
02:30:04,799 --> 02:30:10,000
we're really have started over the last

4717
02:30:08,318 --> 02:30:13,199
five years in particular to see

4718
02:30:10,000 --> 02:30:15,760
the first cracks of uh no humanities

4719
02:30:13,200 --> 02:30:18,640
and me starting to make things that look

4720
02:30:15,760 --> 02:30:20,800
like they'll turn into victories

4721
02:30:18,639 --> 02:30:22,639
do you uh do you think humans can

4722
02:30:20,799 --> 02:30:26,239
eventually live forever

4723
02:30:22,639 --> 02:30:27,920
and maybe as a side comment to that what

4724
02:30:26,239 --> 02:30:29,840
technology do you think will enable that

4725
02:30:27,920 --> 02:30:32,318
is a genetic modification

4726
02:30:29,840 --> 02:30:33,920
is it cloning is it uploading your mind

4727
02:30:32,318 --> 02:30:35,279
define forever like are we talking a

4728
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:38,398
thousand years a million

4729
02:30:35,280 --> 02:30:40,479
10 to the 14 10 to the 45

4730
02:30:38,398 --> 02:30:41,439
well let's start as i tweeted today

4731
02:30:40,478 --> 02:30:43,039
eventually everything

4732
02:30:41,439 --> 02:30:44,639
uh the universe will be filled with

4733
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:47,840
supermassive black holes

4734
02:30:44,639 --> 02:30:49,840
so that that forever maybe like

4735
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:50,880
backtracking to work we'll have we'll

4736
02:30:49,840 --> 02:30:54,639
have 10 the

4737
02:30:50,879 --> 02:30:54,639
16 years to figure it out yes

4738
02:30:54,959 --> 02:31:00,318
uh yeah maybe travel between um

4739
02:30:58,478 --> 02:31:02,879
between the multiverse between the

4740
02:31:00,318 --> 02:31:06,639
different universes the multiverse

4741
02:31:02,879 --> 02:31:10,879
i mean but forever meaning like

4742
02:31:06,639 --> 02:31:12,959
you know uh millennia um um

4743
02:31:10,879 --> 02:31:15,039
i guess i definitely think that we can

4744
02:31:12,959 --> 02:31:16,639
get there i definitely think that it's

4745
02:31:15,040 --> 02:31:18,560
the sort of thing that's

4746
02:31:16,639 --> 02:31:20,559
going to take an insanely huge amount of

4747
02:31:18,559 --> 02:31:21,760
work and i definitely think it's the

4748
02:31:20,559 --> 02:31:23,279
sort of thing where

4749
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:25,280
you know once we figure out the first

4750
02:31:23,280 --> 02:31:27,680
crop of problems and

4751
02:31:25,280 --> 02:31:29,200
like people start living to 150 we'll

4752
02:31:27,680 --> 02:31:30,720
just realize that there's like 10 other

4753
02:31:29,200 --> 02:31:32,000
problems that kill you half a slowly and

4754
02:31:30,719 --> 02:31:34,559
will have to do more work

4755
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:36,079
but you know the good news is that this

4756
02:31:34,559 --> 02:31:37,600
this is you know aubry's longevity

4757
02:31:36,079 --> 02:31:40,079
escape velocity argument that

4758
02:31:37,600 --> 02:31:41,760
if you get everyone to lift 250 now then

4759
02:31:40,079 --> 02:31:45,280
you know you have half a century to fix

4760
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:47,760
all those other problems as well so yeah

4761
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:48,399
i'm optimistic for that reason i think

4762
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:50,719
um

4763
02:31:48,398 --> 02:31:51,760
it you definitely do not want to

4764
02:31:50,719 --> 02:31:53,599
underestimate

4765
02:31:51,760 --> 02:31:55,200
uh human ingenuity especially over the

4766
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:57,040
long term but just to look at what

4767
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:58,880
happens to computers between you know

4768
02:31:57,040 --> 02:32:00,880
the eniac in 1950 and where we are in

4769
02:31:58,879 --> 02:32:03,279
2020 right like that's

4770
02:32:00,879 --> 02:32:04,559
a span of 70 years um so like you know

4771
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:07,040
both of us i think

4772
02:32:04,559 --> 02:32:07,840
with uh you know even just present-day

4773
02:32:07,040 --> 02:32:10,960
technology and

4774
02:32:07,840 --> 02:32:12,559
we have at least 70 more years to left

4775
02:32:10,959 --> 02:32:14,559
so just like imagine what kind of sea

4776
02:32:12,559 --> 02:32:16,639
change will happen in biomedicine

4777
02:32:14,559 --> 02:32:18,079
during that time and the other thing

4778
02:32:16,639 --> 02:32:18,559
that made me optimistic is that i

4779
02:32:18,079 --> 02:32:21,920
actually

4780
02:32:18,559 --> 02:32:25,039
think covet has been this kind of

4781
02:32:21,920 --> 02:32:27,920
event that's really a kind of pushed

4782
02:32:25,040 --> 02:32:29,760
um biomedicine and especially like

4783
02:32:27,920 --> 02:32:32,000
activist approaches to biomedicine

4784
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:33,600
really into the public consciousness

4785
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:36,239
right like it basically

4786
02:32:33,600 --> 02:32:37,439
it's put people into this mindset that

4787
02:32:36,239 --> 02:32:39,039
you know wait but like

4788
02:32:37,439 --> 02:32:40,479
you know it's not just like you know the

4789
02:32:39,040 --> 02:32:42,720
bits and tweets that are

4790
02:32:40,478 --> 02:32:43,760
going to save the world you know the bio

4791
02:32:42,719 --> 02:32:48,000
is actually like

4792
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:50,559
super important and huge and um

4793
02:32:48,000 --> 02:32:52,559
you know ultimately what's uh ending the

4794
02:32:50,559 --> 02:32:54,239
ending covid basically you know is that

4795
02:32:52,559 --> 02:32:56,079
the vaccines and the vaccines have just

4796
02:32:54,239 --> 02:33:00,159
been you know amazing

4797
02:32:56,079 --> 02:33:03,200
and uh if you can take that energy and

4798
02:33:00,159 --> 02:33:05,039
start and also like this uh

4799
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:06,399
i think philosophical attitude that i've

4800
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:07,520
noticed like i think

4801
02:33:06,398 --> 02:33:09,840
the way that i would describe the

4802
02:33:07,520 --> 02:33:12,640
philosophical attitude here

4803
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:13,359
this is going more depth first is that i

4804
02:33:12,639 --> 02:33:16,639
think

4805
02:33:13,359 --> 02:33:18,559
the way that i kind of interpret part of

4806
02:33:16,639 --> 02:33:20,879
what i would call late 20th century

4807
02:33:18,559 --> 02:33:21,279
ideology is that there is this mentality

4808
02:33:20,879 --> 02:33:24,239
that

4809
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:24,960
you know nature is good and disruptions

4810
02:33:24,239 --> 02:33:26,639
from nature

4811
02:33:24,959 --> 02:33:28,478
are bad and generally you want to

4812
02:33:26,639 --> 02:33:30,000
minimize disruptions from nature

4813
02:33:28,478 --> 02:33:31,358
and like this exists everywhere in the

4814
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:33,200
political spectrum right so there's

4815
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:35,040
nature as in literal nature

4816
02:33:33,200 --> 02:33:36,800
and my view is that like the right wing

4817
02:33:35,040 --> 02:33:40,080
version of that is market sas nature

4818
02:33:36,799 --> 02:33:40,559
right um markets as nature yeah like you

4819
02:33:40,079 --> 02:33:43,359
know they

4820
02:33:40,559 --> 02:33:45,279
the way that that like that kind of

4821
02:33:43,359 --> 02:33:47,200
philosophy talks about you know

4822
02:33:45,280 --> 02:33:49,040
markets and like the goal of not

4823
02:33:47,200 --> 02:33:51,359
interfering with them like you know it's

4824
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:52,880
it is very kind of like nature styled

4825
02:33:51,359 --> 02:33:54,800
and then of course you know the the

4826
02:33:52,879 --> 02:33:57,199
conservative one which is like

4827
02:33:54,799 --> 02:33:58,159
traditional culture that existed before

4828
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:00,000
the activists

4829
02:33:58,159 --> 02:34:01,520
started controlling everything as also

4830
02:34:00,000 --> 02:34:04,159
being a kind of nature

4831
02:34:01,520 --> 02:34:06,000
um but the 21st century attitude and

4832
02:34:04,159 --> 02:34:09,039
like really covet you know

4833
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:11,359
has flipped a lot of minds because

4834
02:34:09,040 --> 02:34:13,359
with kovid what's happened is that well

4835
02:34:11,359 --> 02:34:15,280
no like it's not nature is not safe

4836
02:34:13,359 --> 02:34:17,760
right the default is like

4837
02:34:15,280 --> 02:34:19,520
you know untold and misery and suffering

4838
02:34:17,760 --> 02:34:22,559
and tens of millions of people dying

4839
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:25,760
the only way out for us is through like

4840
02:34:22,559 --> 02:34:28,639
basically um human ingenuity

4841
02:34:25,760 --> 02:34:30,159
and that frame of mind is one that's

4842
02:34:28,639 --> 02:34:33,680
like much more friendly

4843
02:34:30,159 --> 02:34:36,159
to one uh the this other

4844
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:37,680
um change of minds that i want to see

4845
02:34:36,159 --> 02:34:38,879
which is like basically treating aging

4846
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:42,318
as an engineering problem

4847
02:34:38,879 --> 02:34:43,679
right like the default is all 7.8

4848
02:34:42,318 --> 02:34:44,000
billion human beings that are currently

4849
02:34:43,680 --> 02:34:45,120
on this

4850
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:47,359
earth are going to die and they're going

4851
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:48,720
to live their last decade of life in a

4852
02:34:47,359 --> 02:34:50,960
debilitating pain

4853
02:34:48,719 --> 02:34:51,840
and the only way to stop that is human

4854
02:34:50,959 --> 02:34:53,358
ingenuity

4855
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:55,520
and you know we don't we don't have that

4856
02:34:53,359 --> 02:34:56,479
solution yet but you know if we work

4857
02:34:55,520 --> 02:34:58,319
hard we will

4858
02:34:56,478 --> 02:34:59,679
and more and more people on the biology

4859
02:34:58,318 --> 02:35:02,239
side computational biology

4860
02:34:59,680 --> 02:35:04,398
are basically converting the mess of the

4861
02:35:02,239 --> 02:35:05,199
the human biology into an engineering

4862
02:35:04,398 --> 02:35:07,199
problem

4863
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:08,399
and once that conversion is happening

4864
02:35:07,200 --> 02:35:10,000
looking at the

4865
02:35:08,398 --> 02:35:11,439
the genetical the proteins all those

4866
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,239
kinds of things once that conversion

4867
02:35:11,439 --> 02:35:15,200
happens

4868
02:35:12,239 --> 02:35:16,959
you can now apply the tools that we know

4869
02:35:15,200 --> 02:35:18,479
how to solve engineering problems

4870
02:35:16,959 --> 02:35:20,799
to solving it that way and then there's

4871
02:35:18,478 --> 02:35:23,679
also the other version which is

4872
02:35:20,799 --> 02:35:24,559
you know why do we romanticize this meat

4873
02:35:23,680 --> 02:35:27,520
vehicle

4874
02:35:24,559 --> 02:35:29,199
that ultimately is just the thing that

4875
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:30,880
carries the brain maybe we can

4876
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:32,319
more and more convert ourselves into the

4877
02:35:30,879 --> 02:35:34,159
digital realm

4878
02:35:32,318 --> 02:35:35,680
this is where like neural link yeah i

4879
02:35:34,159 --> 02:35:36,318
have the brain computer interfaces and

4880
02:35:35,680 --> 02:35:38,479
then achieve

4881
02:35:36,318 --> 02:35:40,000
immortality in the space of information

4882
02:35:38,478 --> 02:35:41,679
in the digital space versus the

4883
02:35:40,000 --> 02:35:43,680
biology space that stuff's interesting

4884
02:35:41,680 --> 02:35:45,920
too i agree again i think

4885
02:35:43,680 --> 02:35:47,600
you know we we have enough resources and

4886
02:35:45,920 --> 02:35:49,760
we should just try all the parallel

4887
02:35:47,600 --> 02:35:51,120
tracks you know it's great that we have

4888
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:52,478
people just trying to make our bodies

4889
02:35:51,120 --> 02:35:53,439
work it's great that we have people

4890
02:35:52,478 --> 02:35:56,398
trying to

4891
02:35:53,439 --> 02:35:57,680
upload like or improve brain scanning

4892
02:35:56,398 --> 02:35:59,519
it's also great that we have

4893
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:00,800
just like people improving cryonics so

4894
02:35:59,520 --> 02:36:02,560
like we could just like

4895
02:36:00,799 --> 02:36:04,079
you know go to sleep in the freezer and

4896
02:36:02,559 --> 02:36:06,159
um eventually

4897
02:36:04,079 --> 02:36:08,000
hopefully sometime in the future you

4898
02:36:06,159 --> 02:36:10,879
know healthy is going to be able to wake

4899
02:36:08,000 --> 02:36:12,318
up um all of this uh um you know you

4900
02:36:10,879 --> 02:36:14,398
know anyone who

4901
02:36:12,318 --> 02:36:15,840
gets chronically frozen today will be

4902
02:36:14,398 --> 02:36:17,439
able to wake up but you know

4903
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:19,040
that's all that's a bad right that's the

4904
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:21,920
last resort and then

4905
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:22,240
the other interesting thing about um the

4906
02:36:21,920 --> 02:36:24,960
like

4907
02:36:22,239 --> 02:36:25,520
extreme uploading approach right is um

4908
02:36:24,959 --> 02:36:28,719
like

4909
02:36:25,520 --> 02:36:32,479
we're excited about space and one of the

4910
02:36:28,719 --> 02:36:34,318
points that uh a lot of science

4911
02:36:32,478 --> 02:36:35,519
or like hard science fiction types make

4912
02:36:34,318 --> 02:36:36,959
is that you know if you want to explore

4913
02:36:35,520 --> 02:36:37,520
space that's a lot easier if you're not

4914
02:36:36,959 --> 02:36:40,079
a human

4915
02:36:37,520 --> 02:36:40,720
right like one example of this is that

4916
02:36:40,079 --> 02:36:42,398
you know

4917
02:36:40,719 --> 02:36:43,519
in the context of humans we're talking

4918
02:36:42,398 --> 02:36:44,799
about like oh we're going to be able to

4919
02:36:43,520 --> 02:36:46,079
go to the moon oh we're going to be able

4920
02:36:44,799 --> 02:36:48,799
to go to mars

4921
02:36:46,079 --> 02:36:50,398
but there's this project called starshot

4922
02:36:48,799 --> 02:36:51,519
i believe right that's basically trying

4923
02:36:50,398 --> 02:36:54,079
to

4924
02:36:51,520 --> 02:36:55,120
send spacecraft to mini spacecrafts to

4925
02:36:54,079 --> 02:36:57,200
alpha centauri

4926
02:36:55,120 --> 02:36:59,200
and they literally believe that they're

4927
02:36:57,200 --> 02:37:00,640
going to be able to get spacecraft over

4928
02:36:59,200 --> 02:37:01,600
to alpha centauri like four light years

4929
02:37:00,639 --> 02:37:04,478
away by

4930
02:37:01,600 --> 02:37:05,840
like the 2060s no i mean by traveling

4931
02:37:04,478 --> 02:37:06,239
close to the speed of light yeah exactly

4932
02:37:05,840 --> 02:37:08,159
like

4933
02:37:06,239 --> 02:37:09,439
so based the way it works is you know

4934
02:37:08,159 --> 02:37:10,879
you have these light sails like you

4935
02:37:09,439 --> 02:37:12,159
basically take the as a spacecraft and

4936
02:37:10,879 --> 02:37:13,839
you shine a laser at it

4937
02:37:12,159 --> 02:37:15,280
and the laser is insanely strong and

4938
02:37:13,840 --> 02:37:18,639
quickly accelerated at

4939
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:20,560
100 g's no i think it was 10 000 gs

4940
02:37:18,639 --> 02:37:21,840
um until it gets to 20 the speed of

4941
02:37:20,559 --> 02:37:22,559
light and then you know it goes on your

4942
02:37:21,840 --> 02:37:25,840
merry way

4943
02:37:22,559 --> 02:37:28,879
right so if you wants to be in

4944
02:37:25,840 --> 02:37:30,000
um like personally explore the alpha

4945
02:37:28,879 --> 02:37:32,799
centauri system

4946
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:33,520
within like two centuries or once or one

4947
02:37:32,799 --> 02:37:37,438
century

4948
02:37:33,520 --> 02:37:39,200
then you know being a robot is like

4949
02:37:37,439 --> 02:37:40,479
by far the most practical way to do it

4950
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:42,399
because there's no way that a human

4951
02:37:40,478 --> 02:37:44,799
being can survive 10 000 years

4952
02:37:42,398 --> 02:37:46,478
so it's it's definitely interesting long

4953
02:37:44,799 --> 02:37:48,639
term but at the same time

4954
02:37:46,478 --> 02:37:51,039
like there's definitely a lot of like

4955
02:37:48,639 --> 02:37:53,439
psychological hang-ups and a lot of like

4956
02:37:51,040 --> 02:37:54,240
deep philosophy that we'll just have to

4957
02:37:53,439 --> 02:37:56,079
grapple with

4958
02:37:54,239 --> 02:37:57,439
well i think to get there i think what

4959
02:37:56,079 --> 02:37:58,959
it hangs on the

4960
02:37:57,439 --> 02:38:00,880
topic of whether we can convert

4961
02:37:58,959 --> 02:38:02,079
consciousness into an engineering

4962
02:38:00,879 --> 02:38:05,039
problem so like

4963
02:38:02,079 --> 02:38:06,318
is consciousness tied to our biology

4964
02:38:05,040 --> 02:38:08,560
because the moment we can

4965
02:38:06,318 --> 02:38:09,840
convert consciousness into a digital

4966
02:38:08,559 --> 02:38:12,239
form then we can

4967
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:13,600
send it with that light sale to office

4968
02:38:12,239 --> 02:38:16,559
centauri until then

4969
02:38:13,600 --> 02:38:17,840
a robot is not carrying anything except

4970
02:38:16,559 --> 02:38:19,519
maybe some basic knowledge like

4971
02:38:17,840 --> 02:38:22,398
wikipedia it's not carrying

4972
02:38:19,520 --> 02:38:23,439
the flame of human consciousness i have

4973
02:38:22,398 --> 02:38:25,760
high hopes

4974
02:38:23,439 --> 02:38:27,439
for converting consciousness into

4975
02:38:25,760 --> 02:38:29,200
engineering problem

4976
02:38:27,439 --> 02:38:30,880
in fact i think it's not as difficult as

4977
02:38:29,200 --> 02:38:32,240
people think i'm i

4978
02:38:30,879 --> 02:38:34,398
agree with that i'm definitely in the

4979
02:38:32,239 --> 02:38:36,159
camp that consciousness is

4980
02:38:34,398 --> 02:38:38,239
a property of the algorithm and not a

4981
02:38:36,159 --> 02:38:40,478
property of brain structure

4982
02:38:38,239 --> 02:38:42,079
um the other fun like the kinds of

4983
02:38:40,478 --> 02:38:43,599
philosophical things we'd have to grab

4984
02:38:42,079 --> 02:38:45,039
with grapple with is like

4985
02:38:43,600 --> 02:38:46,960
once you upload yourself like you can

4986
02:38:45,040 --> 02:38:48,880
hit control c you know like

4987
02:38:46,959 --> 02:38:51,119
it would be wouldn't be lovely to have

4988
02:38:48,879 --> 02:38:53,438
like 10 copies of fellow experience

4989
02:38:51,120 --> 02:38:54,640
like we could just interview everyone so

4990
02:38:53,439 --> 02:38:56,318
this is i mean this is

4991
02:38:54,639 --> 02:38:58,398
i i have to ask this question it's a

4992
02:38:56,318 --> 02:38:59,760
difficult one which

4993
02:38:58,398 --> 02:39:01,599
i don't think he'll be wonderful first

4994
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:04,398
of all um

4995
02:39:01,600 --> 02:39:06,239
sure so in the following way and this

4996
02:39:04,398 --> 02:39:08,719
has to do with immortality as well

4997
02:39:06,239 --> 02:39:09,840
there's something about scarcity that

4998
02:39:08,719 --> 02:39:12,719
creates

4999
02:39:09,840 --> 02:39:14,318
value or um there's a bunch of

5000
02:39:12,719 --> 02:39:16,398
philosophers victor franco

5001
02:39:14,318 --> 02:39:17,359
bernard williams ernest becker they

5002
02:39:16,398 --> 02:39:20,559
argue that

5003
02:39:17,359 --> 02:39:21,200
death or the scarcity of life creates

5004
02:39:20,559 --> 02:39:24,318
meaning

5005
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:27,600
and the reason we life is beautiful

5006
02:39:24,318 --> 02:39:28,478
the reason so many moments of experience

5007
02:39:27,600 --> 02:39:31,600
of

5008
02:39:28,478 --> 02:39:34,478
of love or delicious food

5009
02:39:31,600 --> 02:39:35,280
all those things are made delicious

5010
02:39:34,478 --> 02:39:37,519
because they're

5011
02:39:35,280 --> 02:39:39,520
finite because they end and because we

5012
02:39:37,520 --> 02:39:41,840
don't have that many of them

5013
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:43,680
and there's a kind of worry that if we

5014
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:46,159
extend the human lifespan

5015
02:39:43,680 --> 02:39:46,880
if we achieve immortality or if we god

5016
02:39:46,159 --> 02:39:50,000
forbid

5017
02:39:46,879 --> 02:39:52,318
clone me

5018
02:39:50,000 --> 02:39:53,840
multiple times then you lose the

5019
02:39:52,318 --> 02:39:56,079
richness of what it means

5020
02:39:53,840 --> 02:39:56,880
to have this life to have this

5021
02:39:56,079 --> 02:39:58,639
experience

5022
02:39:56,879 --> 02:40:00,239
does that worry you at all do you think

5023
02:39:58,639 --> 02:40:02,639
there's some aspect to which

5024
02:40:00,239 --> 02:40:03,680
death does in fact give meaning to life

5025
02:40:02,639 --> 02:40:05,680
i guess like

5026
02:40:03,680 --> 02:40:07,280
the one historical parallel and like

5027
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:07,680
this might be a bit unfair is that you

5028
02:40:07,280 --> 02:40:09,520
know

5029
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:10,720
there have been philosophers that said

5030
02:40:09,520 --> 02:40:13,680
that have said things like

5031
02:40:10,719 --> 02:40:14,959
you know war gives like meaning to human

5032
02:40:13,680 --> 02:40:17,279
collectives and

5033
02:40:14,959 --> 02:40:19,438
the struggle for supremacy between you

5034
02:40:17,279 --> 02:40:21,600
know nations and races as this

5035
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:23,600
like big driver of progress that like

5036
02:40:21,600 --> 02:40:25,120
that ensures that ever that everyone

5037
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:27,600
strives to be their best

5038
02:40:25,120 --> 02:40:29,279
and um you know of course uh this

5039
02:40:27,600 --> 02:40:30,960
viewpoint got into the head of a crazy

5040
02:40:29,279 --> 02:40:32,000
austrian guy and 20 years later his

5041
02:40:30,959 --> 02:40:32,719
soldiers were shooting at my

5042
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:34,959
grandparents

5043
02:40:32,719 --> 02:40:36,239
um so you know these days we don't

5044
02:40:34,959 --> 02:40:38,639
really

5045
02:40:36,239 --> 02:40:40,159
have that but yet life still feels

5046
02:40:38,639 --> 02:40:41,039
meaningful there's we've still found

5047
02:40:40,159 --> 02:40:44,719
other ways to

5048
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:47,120
uh or them like they're still

5049
02:40:44,719 --> 02:40:48,559
uh striving for technological progress

5050
02:40:47,120 --> 02:40:51,040
there's still

5051
02:40:48,559 --> 02:40:52,559
um you know uh striving for

5052
02:40:51,040 --> 02:40:54,560
self-improvement in general

5053
02:40:52,559 --> 02:40:56,239
and it turns out that you know you don't

5054
02:40:54,559 --> 02:40:57,840
actually need to have existential

5055
02:40:56,239 --> 02:40:59,359
conflicts in order to

5056
02:40:57,840 --> 02:41:00,639
in order to have that now maybe you need

5057
02:40:59,359 --> 02:41:02,159
conflict but we have other kinds of

5058
02:41:00,639 --> 02:41:03,599
conflicts right look we have you know

5059
02:41:02,159 --> 02:41:05,359
competition between businesses

5060
02:41:03,600 --> 02:41:07,439
competition between political ideologies

5061
02:41:05,359 --> 02:41:10,399
competition between projects

5062
02:41:07,439 --> 02:41:10,720
and so you know these are like whatever

5063
02:41:10,398 --> 02:41:12,478
what

5064
02:41:10,719 --> 02:41:14,559
whatever the psychological needs are

5065
02:41:12,478 --> 02:41:18,398
like they're just our substitutes for it

5066
02:41:14,559 --> 02:41:20,799
so i guess like yeah so if we uh

5067
02:41:18,398 --> 02:41:21,519
i'm trying to say i i feel like once we

5068
02:41:20,799 --> 02:41:25,119
start

5069
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:27,200
living to to the age of uh 200 then

5070
02:41:25,120 --> 02:41:29,040
like i'm just intuitively expecting that

5071
02:41:27,200 --> 02:41:31,760
we'll see some like

5072
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:32,240
substitutes emerge in the same way yeah

5073
02:41:31,760 --> 02:41:35,200
that

5074
02:41:32,239 --> 02:41:37,760
will will create conflicts of other

5075
02:41:35,200 --> 02:41:40,319
sorts that lead to less human suffering

5076
02:41:37,760 --> 02:41:42,318
than wars do like we'll just start

5077
02:41:40,318 --> 02:41:44,639
playing diablo four five six and

5078
02:41:42,318 --> 02:41:45,439
because you die in video games so maybe

5079
02:41:44,639 --> 02:41:48,478
we'll get

5080
02:41:45,439 --> 02:41:50,479
some of the inkling of scarcity

5081
02:41:48,478 --> 02:41:52,239
through the activities we partake in as

5082
02:41:50,478 --> 02:41:54,719
opposed to our own body dying

5083
02:41:52,239 --> 02:41:55,439
i mean i feel shitty when i uh like you

5084
02:41:54,719 --> 02:41:58,719
can

5085
02:41:55,439 --> 02:42:00,239
i remember in diablo three you can play

5086
02:41:58,719 --> 02:42:01,840
in hardcore mode

5087
02:42:00,239 --> 02:42:03,840
where if you die in the game your

5088
02:42:01,840 --> 02:42:07,359
character is dead maybe you will

5089
02:42:03,840 --> 02:42:09,040
get the the richness of

5090
02:42:07,359 --> 02:42:10,479
like what that we currently get from

5091
02:42:09,040 --> 02:42:12,319
life by having like

5092
02:42:10,478 --> 02:42:14,159
little artificial versions of ourselves

5093
02:42:12,318 --> 02:42:15,680
that die interestingly enough as i've

5094
02:42:14,159 --> 02:42:17,119
just like personally

5095
02:42:15,680 --> 02:42:18,880
spent more time in this world i've

5096
02:42:17,120 --> 02:42:20,319
started realizing that you know there is

5097
02:42:18,879 --> 02:42:23,358
a concept of like

5098
02:42:20,318 --> 02:42:24,799
real fight finiteness that still like

5099
02:42:23,359 --> 02:42:26,239
exists and it might even still be a

5100
02:42:24,799 --> 02:42:28,079
thing that provides meaning that doesn't

5101
02:42:26,239 --> 02:42:30,559
require anyone to actually die

5102
02:42:28,079 --> 02:42:31,520
like for example like how many people

5103
02:42:30,559 --> 02:42:34,318
from

5104
02:42:31,520 --> 02:42:35,600
middle school or even high school or

5105
02:42:34,318 --> 02:42:36,559
yours like do you still talk to

5106
02:42:35,600 --> 02:42:38,479
regularly

5107
02:42:36,559 --> 02:42:40,159
i'm happy to be close friends with like

5108
02:42:38,478 --> 02:42:41,760
four or five of them okay well like in

5109
02:42:40,159 --> 02:42:43,039
my case the answer is zero for middle

5110
02:42:41,760 --> 02:42:45,920
school and two for high school

5111
02:42:43,040 --> 02:42:46,800
you're right right it dropped exactly it

5112
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:48,960
dropped

5113
02:42:46,799 --> 02:42:50,879
right and so like there's a lot of these

5114
02:42:48,959 --> 02:42:52,000
just like relationships that end up

5115
02:42:50,879 --> 02:42:55,358
being very finite

5116
02:42:52,000 --> 02:42:57,120
um a person changes their i feel like a

5117
02:42:55,359 --> 02:42:59,040
person changes enough of their worldview

5118
02:42:57,120 --> 02:43:00,640
after 25 years wasn't there even a study

5119
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:03,040
about this something like

5120
02:43:00,639 --> 02:43:04,079
a person and themselves 25 years later

5121
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:06,720
about as different

5122
02:43:04,079 --> 02:43:07,600
as like two different people or

5123
02:43:06,719 --> 02:43:09,920
something like this

5124
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:11,760
um so you know like i mean just like you

5125
02:43:09,920 --> 02:43:12,799
can have conflict without bloodshed i

5126
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:15,200
think um you know you can

5127
02:43:12,799 --> 02:43:16,478
you can have finiteness and even you

5128
02:43:15,200 --> 02:43:18,720
know the the necessary

5129
02:43:16,478 --> 02:43:19,599
sorrows of uh finiteness that give

5130
02:43:18,719 --> 02:43:21,760
meaning without

5131
02:43:19,600 --> 02:43:22,640
like literally any anyone having to end

5132
02:43:21,760 --> 02:43:24,639
their life

5133
02:43:22,639 --> 02:43:26,959
and hopefully if we do extend our life

5134
02:43:24,639 --> 02:43:28,799
we'll figure out ways to extend

5135
02:43:26,959 --> 02:43:31,039
the period of time where there's newer

5136
02:43:28,799 --> 02:43:31,599
neuroplasticity yes to where we could

5137
02:43:31,040 --> 02:43:34,240
change

5138
02:43:31,600 --> 02:43:34,960
our world views continually throughout

5139
02:43:34,239 --> 02:43:37,039
that time so

5140
02:43:34,959 --> 02:43:38,318
have some of these different phases of

5141
02:43:37,040 --> 02:43:40,319
life

5142
02:43:38,318 --> 02:43:43,199
uh i thought it would be fun to hear you

5143
02:43:40,318 --> 02:43:43,199
speak a little russian

5144
02:44:14,770 --> 02:44:17,809
[Music]

5145
02:44:32,159 --> 02:44:35,600
do you think there's uh so for people

5146
02:44:34,159 --> 02:44:39,279
who don't speak russian

5147
02:44:35,600 --> 02:44:40,880
that uh vitalik said that there is um

5148
02:44:39,279 --> 02:44:42,319
that there is something to the spirit of

5149
02:44:40,879 --> 02:44:42,959
the people that are russian that are

5150
02:44:42,318 --> 02:44:45,920
working

5151
02:44:42,959 --> 02:44:47,278
in the cryptocurrency world that uh is a

5152
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:49,680
little bit different and

5153
02:44:47,279 --> 02:44:51,680
it and it's something that uh that

5154
02:44:49,680 --> 02:44:52,720
connects to some kind of aspect of your

5155
02:44:51,680 --> 02:44:55,600
own

5156
02:44:52,719 --> 02:44:56,879
self some kind of roots there it it it's

5157
02:44:55,600 --> 02:44:58,318
it's kind of interesting do you think

5158
02:44:56,879 --> 02:45:00,000
that there's um

5159
02:44:58,318 --> 02:45:01,600
does it make you sad that there's these

5160
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:05,439
two different worlds

5161
02:45:01,600 --> 02:45:06,640
that are uh sort of in part disconnected

5162
02:45:05,439 --> 02:45:08,720
by

5163
02:45:06,639 --> 02:45:10,639
language and i'm sure the same could be

5164
02:45:08,719 --> 02:45:11,599
the case with china and other parts of

5165
02:45:10,639 --> 02:45:14,959
the world

5166
02:45:11,600 --> 02:45:17,200
or the language

5167
02:45:14,959 --> 02:45:18,318
slows the transmission of the beauty of

5168
02:45:17,200 --> 02:45:19,920
the culture

5169
02:45:18,318 --> 02:45:22,079
in a certain kind of way where you can't

5170
02:45:19,920 --> 02:45:24,000
truly collaborate like you can

5171
02:45:22,079 --> 02:45:25,680
all speak english you're collaborating

5172
02:45:24,000 --> 02:45:28,000
on maybe a technical level

5173
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:28,960
but you're not collaborating on the

5174
02:45:28,000 --> 02:45:31,120
level of like

5175
02:45:28,959 --> 02:45:34,079
some deep human connection do you see

5176
02:45:31,120 --> 02:45:36,000
that being able to speak both languages

5177
02:45:34,079 --> 02:45:37,279
there's definitely benefits i think to

5178
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:39,760
be able to like

5179
02:45:37,279 --> 02:45:42,720
speak multiple languages and like once

5180
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:44,880
you can right like you it you discover

5181
02:45:42,719 --> 02:45:46,719
that like even your mindset changes

5182
02:45:44,879 --> 02:45:48,159
while you're in speaking in one language

5183
02:45:46,719 --> 02:45:49,199
versus the other like people have told

5184
02:45:48,159 --> 02:45:52,318
me this like

5185
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:54,240
when i speak russian i sound more like i

5186
02:45:52,318 --> 02:45:56,318
guess like to the point in pragmatic

5187
02:45:54,239 --> 02:45:57,279
when i speak chinese i sound more cute

5188
02:45:56,318 --> 02:46:00,879
when i

5189
02:45:57,279 --> 02:46:03,359
speak english i'm something else um

5190
02:46:00,879 --> 02:46:03,358
i guess

5191
02:46:04,159 --> 02:46:07,920
there's definitely like a richness that

5192
02:46:06,318 --> 02:46:10,559
you're missing if you're only

5193
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:11,120
like in one of these language bubbles

5194
02:46:10,559 --> 02:46:13,519
but

5195
02:46:11,120 --> 02:46:15,040
you know i guess the arguments on the

5196
02:46:13,520 --> 02:46:16,720
other side would be that you know if

5197
02:46:15,040 --> 02:46:17,279
everyone spoke the same language then

5198
02:46:16,719 --> 02:46:19,199
like

5199
02:46:17,279 --> 02:46:22,399
there would just be one bubble right

5200
02:46:19,200 --> 02:46:24,720
this is the challenge i think like

5201
02:46:22,398 --> 02:46:26,239
there are actually benefits to having

5202
02:46:24,719 --> 02:46:27,920
cultural diversity and you definitely

5203
02:46:26,239 --> 02:46:28,799
don't want the entire world to be too

5204
02:46:27,920 --> 02:46:30,960
conformist

5205
02:46:28,799 --> 02:46:32,719
yeah and well one of the interesting

5206
02:46:30,959 --> 02:46:35,358
things about crypto is that it's just

5207
02:46:32,719 --> 02:46:36,159
a culture that actually like manages to

5208
02:46:35,359 --> 02:46:37,920
like

5209
02:46:36,159 --> 02:46:39,520
somehow you know have its uniqueness and

5210
02:46:37,920 --> 02:46:40,799
brazil and even preserve its

5211
02:46:39,520 --> 02:46:42,479
independence from

5212
02:46:40,799 --> 02:46:44,079
all of all of these surrounding

5213
02:46:42,478 --> 02:46:44,879
countries despite being embedded in all

5214
02:46:44,079 --> 02:46:47,760
of them

5215
02:46:44,879 --> 02:46:48,719
so it uh spans outside the geographical

5216
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:50,960
boundaries

5217
02:46:48,719 --> 02:46:53,278
and language in some ways does as well

5218
02:46:50,959 --> 02:46:54,959
and then in the way these cultures

5219
02:46:53,279 --> 02:46:56,560
these bubbles are created i mean they

5220
02:46:54,959 --> 02:46:58,239
overlap in interesting ways it's almost

5221
02:46:56,559 --> 02:46:59,920
like a hierarchy and the same is the

5222
02:46:58,239 --> 02:47:01,840
case with the crypto world

5223
02:46:59,920 --> 02:47:03,359
there's uh you know there's communities

5224
02:47:01,840 --> 02:47:04,559
associated with these cryptocurrencies

5225
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:05,760
there's communities within those

5226
02:47:04,559 --> 02:47:08,159
communities

5227
02:47:05,760 --> 02:47:09,920
and it's yeah i mean i think like you

5228
02:47:08,159 --> 02:47:11,119
know it's definitely sad whenever these

5229
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:14,318
groups are

5230
02:47:11,120 --> 02:47:16,000
are fighting each other um and like it's

5231
02:47:14,318 --> 02:47:19,680
definitely good for them to

5232
02:47:16,000 --> 02:47:22,398
like if people can cooperate more um

5233
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:23,040
but you know at the same time like just

5234
02:47:22,398 --> 02:47:25,519
having

5235
02:47:23,040 --> 02:47:27,680
like groups of people that have you know

5236
02:47:25,520 --> 02:47:28,960
different kinds of life experiences like

5237
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:31,600
there's definitely something benefit

5238
02:47:28,959 --> 02:47:33,119
from that so let me ask one last

5239
02:47:31,600 --> 02:47:33,680
question i don't think i asked you last

5240
02:47:33,120 --> 02:47:35,040
time

5241
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:37,040
the ridiculous question about the

5242
02:47:35,040 --> 02:47:38,720
meaning of life uh

5243
02:47:37,040 --> 02:47:41,439
you know dostoevsky said beauty will

5244
02:47:38,719 --> 02:47:41,438
save the world

5245
02:47:43,920 --> 02:47:47,279
some people believe money is a big part

5246
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:49,680
of happiness and

5247
02:47:47,279 --> 02:47:50,319
you've turned first of all you've made a

5248
02:47:49,680 --> 02:47:52,159
lot of money

5249
02:47:50,318 --> 02:47:53,760
you turned away a lot of money he turned

5250
02:47:52,159 --> 02:47:56,239
away a lot of power

5251
02:47:53,760 --> 02:47:59,520
so you're a fascinating person to ask

5252
02:47:56,239 --> 02:48:01,279
what do you think is meaning to life

5253
02:47:59,520 --> 02:48:03,439
the thing that i've realized with money

5254
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:05,359
as i uh

5255
02:48:03,439 --> 02:48:06,960
have experienced both having a little of

5256
02:48:05,359 --> 02:48:10,800
it and i'm having a lot of it

5257
02:48:06,959 --> 02:48:14,398
is that um the benefit

5258
02:48:10,799 --> 02:48:16,079
of like you can get the most out of um

5259
02:48:14,398 --> 02:48:18,159
money if you think of it not as

5260
02:48:16,079 --> 02:48:19,600
something that like lets you do and have

5261
02:48:18,159 --> 02:48:21,200
more things but as

5262
02:48:19,600 --> 02:48:23,359
something that lets you worry about

5263
02:48:21,200 --> 02:48:25,920
fewer things right like

5264
02:48:23,359 --> 02:48:27,840
you know if you have you know if the

5265
02:48:25,920 --> 02:48:28,639
your savings are just you know non-zero

5266
02:48:27,840 --> 02:48:30,079
at all then

5267
02:48:28,639 --> 02:48:32,318
you don't have to worry as much about

5268
02:48:30,079 --> 02:48:34,478
losing your job and

5269
02:48:32,318 --> 02:48:35,760
you know if you feel like you're you

5270
02:48:34,478 --> 02:48:37,278
have a job that just like really

5271
02:48:35,760 --> 02:48:38,880
conflicts with your values then

5272
02:48:37,279 --> 02:48:40,159
like if you have even six months saved

5273
02:48:38,879 --> 02:48:41,599
up that just makes it easier for you to

5274
02:48:40,159 --> 02:48:42,559
say bye-bye i'm going to do something

5275
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:45,950
else

5276
02:48:42,559 --> 02:48:47,680
if you have more money then you can

5277
02:48:45,950 --> 02:48:50,399
[Music]

5278
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:51,520
you know not worry about like even what

5279
02:48:50,398 --> 02:48:53,920
you're doing the am

5280
02:48:51,520 --> 02:48:55,680
needing to be profitable at all um once

5281
02:48:53,920 --> 02:48:58,079
you get more money then

5282
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:59,840
like you can you know choose

5283
02:48:58,079 --> 02:49:01,120
transportation options and food options

5284
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:02,719
that just like

5285
02:49:01,120 --> 02:49:04,319
have less hassle in your life and allow

5286
02:49:02,719 --> 02:49:08,079
you to be lazier uh

5287
02:49:04,318 --> 02:49:10,719
so if you like

5288
02:49:08,079 --> 02:49:11,359
this aspect of just like reducing

5289
02:49:10,719 --> 02:49:13,840
troubles

5290
02:49:11,359 --> 02:49:15,359
and like opening up room for um other

5291
02:49:13,840 --> 02:49:17,840
things i think is

5292
02:49:15,359 --> 02:49:19,359
a big part of it like if you just if you

5293
02:49:17,840 --> 02:49:20,159
instead think of money as being like

5294
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:22,399
this positive

5295
02:49:20,159 --> 02:49:24,000
or this thing that like gives you stuff

5296
02:49:22,398 --> 02:49:26,079
and you try to

5297
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:27,120
derive meaning from the stuff i think

5298
02:49:26,079 --> 02:49:29,760
that's uh

5299
02:49:27,120 --> 02:49:31,120
much more likely to be like a road to

5300
02:49:29,760 --> 02:49:32,239
like basically squandering that

5301
02:49:31,120 --> 02:49:34,880
opportunity

5302
02:49:32,239 --> 02:49:35,920
so yeah and i guess my philosophy is on

5303
02:49:34,879 --> 02:49:38,398
that is definitely

5304
02:49:35,920 --> 02:49:40,079
more subtractive than added over there

5305
02:49:38,398 --> 02:49:41,840
but once you have enough money that you

5306
02:49:40,079 --> 02:49:43,920
don't have to worry about the money

5307
02:49:41,840 --> 02:49:45,920
you're burdened with another question

5308
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:47,840
which is of meaning and

5309
02:49:45,920 --> 02:49:48,960
do you think there's meaning to it all

5310
02:49:47,840 --> 02:49:52,239
or

5311
02:49:48,959 --> 02:49:55,358
it seems like your own life you're

5312
02:49:52,239 --> 02:49:58,159
trying to build cool stuff that

5313
02:49:55,359 --> 02:49:59,200
alleviates some level of suffering in

5314
02:49:58,159 --> 02:50:01,279
the world

5315
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:02,399
well i mean one way to think about it is

5316
02:50:01,279 --> 02:50:04,399
like

5317
02:50:02,398 --> 02:50:05,519
think of think back to like how you

5318
02:50:04,398 --> 02:50:05,920
thought about life when you were in

5319
02:50:05,520 --> 02:50:08,159
school

5320
02:50:05,920 --> 02:50:09,520
right well in school this is interesting

5321
02:50:08,159 --> 02:50:12,719
to think about right because

5322
02:50:09,520 --> 02:50:14,399
in a lot of ways like it's just totally

5323
02:50:12,719 --> 02:50:16,239
outside of bounds of

5324
02:50:14,398 --> 02:50:18,079
you know the kinds of systems that are

5325
02:50:16,239 --> 02:50:20,559
like social systems that we live in as

5326
02:50:18,079 --> 02:50:22,079
um as adults or maybe not like maybe

5327
02:50:20,559 --> 02:50:23,519
things like academia are intended to

5328
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:24,799
replicate parts of school

5329
02:50:23,520 --> 02:50:26,640
like first of all school is very

5330
02:50:24,799 --> 02:50:28,799
totalitarian right like

5331
02:50:26,639 --> 02:50:30,879
you know you have to follow the teacher

5332
02:50:28,799 --> 02:50:32,719
the the teacher's instructions the bulk

5333
02:50:30,879 --> 02:50:35,039
of your schedule is like forced to be in

5334
02:50:32,719 --> 02:50:38,079
particular areas and you know you can

5335
02:50:35,040 --> 02:50:40,399
control um

5336
02:50:38,079 --> 02:50:42,079
and they're real for you from you know

5337
02:50:40,398 --> 02:50:44,239
leaving the grounds during this period

5338
02:50:42,079 --> 02:50:45,200
this period of time um you know assign a

5339
02:50:44,239 --> 02:50:46,959
lot of homework

5340
02:50:45,200 --> 02:50:48,560
but at the same time also you know

5341
02:50:46,959 --> 02:50:50,478
school is a bit of

5342
02:50:48,559 --> 02:50:51,760
a bit of a post-scarcity utopia in that

5343
02:50:50,478 --> 02:50:53,519
you just don't have to worry about

5344
02:50:51,760 --> 02:50:55,760
getting resources for yourself

5345
02:50:53,520 --> 02:50:57,120
and you know we've both like lived

5346
02:50:55,760 --> 02:50:58,800
through 12 years of that

5347
02:50:57,120 --> 02:51:00,880
right so you know like what does that

5348
02:50:58,799 --> 02:51:04,398
say about us and i think

5349
02:51:00,879 --> 02:51:04,879
like in one thing of aspect obviously is

5350
02:51:04,398 --> 02:51:08,799
that

5351
02:51:04,879 --> 02:51:09,039
in it does like there's definitely like

5352
02:51:08,799 --> 02:51:11,358
an

5353
02:51:09,040 --> 02:51:13,040
easiness to living life if all of your

5354
02:51:11,359 --> 02:51:16,640
decisions are made for you

5355
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:19,760
and one of the challenges of

5356
02:51:16,639 --> 02:51:21,840
adulthood i guess is moving to this uh

5357
02:51:19,760 --> 02:51:23,359
world where like all your choices are

5358
02:51:21,840 --> 02:51:23,920
much more self-directed and you just

5359
02:51:23,359 --> 02:51:26,800
have to

5360
02:51:23,920 --> 02:51:29,680
like learn to live and deal with that um

5361
02:51:26,799 --> 02:51:33,679
yeah dealing with the burden of freedom

5362
02:51:29,680 --> 02:51:36,960
in some sense actually interesting and

5363
02:51:33,680 --> 02:51:37,920
because uh i in some ways i feel like

5364
02:51:36,959 --> 02:51:40,478
even my first

5365
02:51:37,920 --> 02:51:41,359
like five years of doing ethereum things

5366
02:51:40,478 --> 02:51:42,719
uh yeah

5367
02:51:41,359 --> 02:51:44,880
my life was not even all that

5368
02:51:42,719 --> 02:51:45,438
self-directed because for a lot of it

5369
02:51:44,879 --> 02:51:47,358
was just

5370
02:51:45,439 --> 02:51:49,200
you know responding to obligations right

5371
02:51:47,359 --> 02:51:50,318
like someone said oh you know come to

5372
02:51:49,200 --> 02:51:52,079
speak at this event

5373
02:51:50,318 --> 02:51:53,519
in korea okay you know come to speak of

5374
02:51:52,079 --> 02:51:56,719
this thing in taiwan okay

5375
02:51:53,520 --> 02:51:57,920
um oh like we need up for ethereum to

5376
02:51:56,719 --> 02:52:00,159
launch we need

5377
02:51:57,920 --> 02:52:01,680
um you know this particular piece to be

5378
02:52:00,159 --> 02:52:04,000
done and tested okay work on that

5379
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:05,840
right we know we need some uh um a proof

5380
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:09,200
of stake algorithm work on that

5381
02:52:05,840 --> 02:52:12,398
and the last year of uh coved

5382
02:52:09,200 --> 02:52:14,079
life um like basically i was like

5383
02:52:12,398 --> 02:52:16,159
holed up in singapore for much of it

5384
02:52:14,079 --> 02:52:18,079
right and it gave me a lot more alone

5385
02:52:16,159 --> 02:52:19,840
time you know i had much less travel

5386
02:52:18,079 --> 02:52:21,520
and that was definitely a very new and

5387
02:52:19,840 --> 02:52:24,960
interesting experience for me

5388
02:52:21,520 --> 02:52:28,239
would you characterize it by sadness

5389
02:52:24,959 --> 02:52:31,358
melancholy hope uh

5390
02:52:28,239 --> 02:52:33,279
dreaming like innovative period like how

5391
02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:35,359
would you characterize that alone time

5392
02:52:33,279 --> 02:52:36,640
sum of all five um definitely some

5393
02:52:35,359 --> 02:52:40,000
self-discovery

5394
02:52:36,639 --> 02:52:41,920
um i definitely did like take this uh

5395
02:52:40,000 --> 02:52:44,000
make this very deliberate decision that

5396
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:47,120
like okay i have this time and

5397
02:52:44,000 --> 02:52:48,559
i'm going to like actually make

5398
02:52:47,120 --> 02:52:50,560
something meaningful out of it

5399
02:52:48,559 --> 02:52:52,398
um so like one example of the things i

5400
02:52:50,559 --> 02:52:55,278
did is i just like actually

5401
02:52:52,398 --> 02:52:57,358
started really listening to our um

5402
02:52:55,279 --> 02:52:59,600
audiobooks and podcasts much more

5403
02:52:57,359 --> 02:53:01,760
like just this year i basically kind of

5404
02:52:59,600 --> 02:53:03,520
discovered that the podcast space is

5405
02:53:01,760 --> 02:53:04,880
real for the first time i guess

5406
02:53:03,520 --> 02:53:06,319
like before that you know there would be

5407
02:53:04,879 --> 02:53:08,079
things that i would get interviewed for

5408
02:53:06,318 --> 02:53:10,159
but yeah i

5409
02:53:08,079 --> 02:53:11,200
was not really kind of like mentally

5410
02:53:10,159 --> 02:53:12,719
incorporated i

5411
02:53:11,200 --> 02:53:14,960
did not mentally incorporate this um

5412
02:53:12,719 --> 02:53:16,159
idea that like podcasts are a thing that

5413
02:53:14,959 --> 02:53:18,398
you can go listen to

5414
02:53:16,159 --> 02:53:19,200
and this year i did okay you know my

5415
02:53:18,398 --> 02:53:21,439
friend uh

5416
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:22,560
um carl lafourche one of the the

5417
02:53:21,439 --> 02:53:24,398
optimism people

5418
02:53:22,559 --> 02:53:25,600
uh recommended hardcore history to me

5419
02:53:24,398 --> 02:53:27,840
and so i went ahead and just

5420
02:53:25,600 --> 02:53:28,880
listens to all the hardcore histories uh

5421
02:53:27,840 --> 02:53:30,880
but then after that

5422
02:53:28,879 --> 02:53:32,559
like yeah listen to like 10 lux

5423
02:53:30,879 --> 02:53:33,920
speedmans and then a bunch of others

5424
02:53:32,559 --> 02:53:37,119
says and

5425
02:53:33,920 --> 02:53:40,398
after that i also got into um audiobooks

5426
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:42,240
um oh i listened to the entire um

5427
02:53:40,398 --> 02:53:44,239
the rise and fall of the third reich the

5428
02:53:42,239 --> 02:53:46,239
whole thing 45 hours

5429
02:53:44,239 --> 02:53:47,920
that that was fascinating so what else

5430
02:53:46,239 --> 02:53:50,478
did you ask about because dana's gonna

5431
02:53:47,920 --> 02:53:52,318
love hearing this i'm gonna tell you

5432
02:53:50,478 --> 02:53:54,879
do you have uh do you have a period of

5433
02:53:52,318 --> 02:53:57,119
history whether it's dan or in general

5434
02:53:54,879 --> 02:53:58,879
that you draw for your own life like

5435
02:53:57,120 --> 02:54:00,479
kind of thinking about the world about

5436
02:53:58,879 --> 02:54:03,679
human nature that you go to

5437
02:54:00,478 --> 02:54:04,478
is it world war ii is it uh wrath of the

5438
02:54:03,680 --> 02:54:08,079
cons the

5439
02:54:04,478 --> 02:54:09,039
injengus is it some other more ancient

5440
02:54:08,079 --> 02:54:10,879
history

5441
02:54:09,040 --> 02:54:12,560
is it world war one is there something

5442
02:54:10,879 --> 02:54:15,438
that kind of echoes with you

5443
02:54:12,559 --> 02:54:17,119
in the voice of dan or or anyone else

5444
02:54:15,439 --> 02:54:19,439
that you connect to

5445
02:54:17,120 --> 02:54:21,120
i feel like the 1930s and 40s are

5446
02:54:19,439 --> 02:54:23,040
fascinating because they force you to

5447
02:54:21,120 --> 02:54:24,800
like really grapple with uh

5448
02:54:23,040 --> 02:54:26,800
the question of like you know where does

5449
02:54:24,799 --> 02:54:29,358
evil come from right like the

5450
02:54:26,799 --> 02:54:30,239
sort of mental puzzle that i've always

5451
02:54:29,359 --> 02:54:32,960
had in my head

5452
02:54:30,239 --> 02:54:34,959
is like on the one hand um you know

5453
02:54:32,959 --> 02:54:37,278
things like the holocaust happened

5454
02:54:34,959 --> 02:54:38,398
but on the other hand if you just go and

5455
02:54:37,279 --> 02:54:40,560
like have a coffee with

5456
02:54:38,398 --> 02:54:42,079
with uh people then like a hundred times

5457
02:54:40,559 --> 02:54:42,559
out of a hundred everyone just seems so

5458
02:54:42,079 --> 02:54:45,520
nice

5459
02:54:42,559 --> 02:54:45,920
yeah yeah so yeah exactly yeah like how

5460
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:48,079
do you

5461
02:54:45,920 --> 02:54:49,040
kind of reconcile the macro in the micro

5462
02:54:48,079 --> 02:54:52,398
there right

5463
02:54:49,040 --> 02:54:53,200
and that's the sort of thing that's very

5464
02:54:52,398 --> 02:54:57,519
difficult

5465
02:54:53,200 --> 02:54:58,960
if you don't have um

5466
02:54:57,520 --> 02:55:00,960
a lot of i guess the right kind of

5467
02:54:58,959 --> 02:55:02,000
personal experience like especially if

5468
02:55:00,959 --> 02:55:03,839
your personal experience

5469
02:55:02,000 --> 02:55:05,439
starts off being sheltered like it was

5470
02:55:03,840 --> 02:55:07,040
for me right like i you know this

5471
02:55:05,439 --> 02:55:08,720
i know the stereotype is that the nerds

5472
02:55:07,040 --> 02:55:09,359
get bullied in school but like actually

5473
02:55:08,719 --> 02:55:10,879
for me

5474
02:55:09,359 --> 02:55:12,800
in my school experience was just being

5475
02:55:10,879 --> 02:55:15,920
treated with kindness by everyone yeah

5476
02:55:12,799 --> 02:55:17,119
and so that definitely made it harder to

5477
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:18,799
understand things

5478
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:20,960
i remember actually being pretty

5479
02:55:18,799 --> 02:55:21,358
blindsided when i started ethereum and

5480
02:55:20,959 --> 02:55:23,199
then

5481
02:55:21,359 --> 02:55:25,200
within six months there started being

5482
02:55:23,200 --> 02:55:26,159
fights over like who would get more

5483
02:55:25,200 --> 02:55:27,760
shares if

5484
02:55:26,159 --> 02:55:29,600
ethereum turned out to be a company and

5485
02:55:27,760 --> 02:55:31,200
then i suggested we should just make it

5486
02:55:29,600 --> 02:55:32,479
be a non-profit and somehow that ended

5487
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:35,840
up upsetting people

5488
02:55:32,478 --> 02:55:35,840
um so

5489
02:55:36,639 --> 02:55:39,920
so the fascinating thing for me is that

5490
02:55:38,478 --> 02:55:41,599
like i've been you know

5491
02:55:39,920 --> 02:55:43,200
obviously reading and listening to the

5492
02:55:41,600 --> 02:55:43,760
history and then at the same time just

5493
02:55:43,200 --> 02:55:45,920
like

5494
02:55:43,760 --> 02:55:46,880
observing things happening in the crypto

5495
02:55:45,920 --> 02:55:49,920
space

5496
02:55:46,879 --> 02:55:52,239
and so one of my interesting

5497
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:54,239
um like mental intuitions that i've

5498
02:55:52,239 --> 02:55:56,799
gotten is that i think

5499
02:55:54,239 --> 02:55:58,719
like most evil doesn't come out of greed

5500
02:55:56,799 --> 02:56:01,920
it comes out of fear

5501
02:55:58,719 --> 02:56:05,438
and like one example

5502
02:56:01,920 --> 02:56:07,760
of this in ethereum lands right is um

5503
02:56:05,439 --> 02:56:08,960
like i think the part of ethereum

5504
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:10,639
history where i thought that the

5505
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:12,559
ethereum community was at its lowest and

5506
02:56:10,639 --> 02:56:15,278
even when i personally was at my lowest

5507
02:56:12,559 --> 02:56:16,398
and if you go back to the dow fork in

5508
02:56:15,279 --> 02:56:17,920
2016 right

5509
02:56:16,398 --> 02:56:19,439
so you know the dow hack happens and

5510
02:56:17,920 --> 02:56:21,439
then we made this controversial decision

5511
02:56:19,439 --> 02:56:25,520
to change the ethereum protocol

5512
02:56:21,439 --> 02:56:27,120
uh and we um

5513
02:56:25,520 --> 02:56:28,720
you know then there was that ethereum

5514
02:56:27,120 --> 02:56:31,279
classic split and

5515
02:56:28,719 --> 02:56:32,398
as soon as that ethereum classic split

5516
02:56:31,279 --> 02:56:34,319
um happened

5517
02:56:32,398 --> 02:56:35,519
you know there was like a lot of anger

5518
02:56:34,318 --> 02:56:37,600
everywhere and

5519
02:56:35,520 --> 02:56:38,800
there started there started especially

5520
02:56:37,600 --> 02:56:41,200
being anger when

5521
02:56:38,799 --> 02:56:43,278
the price of etc started like taking up

5522
02:56:41,200 --> 02:56:45,279
right so this was the time when

5523
02:56:43,279 --> 02:56:46,880
ether started off being 13 dollars and

5524
02:56:45,279 --> 02:56:47,520
then ethereum classic started at zero

5525
02:56:46,879 --> 02:56:49,039
but then

5526
02:56:47,520 --> 02:56:51,600
suddenly there was this one day when

5527
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:53,279
like eath dropped to 12.5 etc went up to

5528
02:56:51,600 --> 02:56:55,600
0.5

5529
02:56:53,279 --> 02:56:57,120
and then they dropped more and people

5530
02:56:55,600 --> 02:57:00,079
were saying things like

5531
02:56:57,120 --> 02:57:02,560
um you know oh this whole thing ethereum

5532
02:57:00,079 --> 02:57:04,159
classic is just as like a psyop by

5533
02:57:02,559 --> 02:57:05,840
you know the bitcoin community and just

5534
02:57:04,159 --> 02:57:06,879
the wealthy bitcoiners trying to destroy

5535
02:57:05,840 --> 02:57:09,279
ethereum

5536
02:57:06,879 --> 02:57:10,879
and like in the back of my mind i knew

5537
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:11,920
that that wasn't entirely true

5538
02:57:10,879 --> 02:57:13,839
like there were definitely were

5539
02:57:11,920 --> 02:57:15,120
bitcoiners but at the same time like i

5540
02:57:13,840 --> 02:57:18,318
think

5541
02:57:15,120 --> 02:57:20,079
blaming political like internal disa or

5542
02:57:18,318 --> 02:57:21,519
blaming disagreements on foreign

5543
02:57:20,079 --> 02:57:22,799
interference right like this is the sort

5544
02:57:21,520 --> 02:57:25,520
of thing that you know like

5545
02:57:22,799 --> 02:57:26,559
countries governments do all the time

5546
02:57:25,520 --> 02:57:28,800
like it's

5547
02:57:26,559 --> 02:57:30,478
a very convenient excuse right because

5548
02:57:28,799 --> 02:57:32,000
it allows you to just like

5549
02:57:30,478 --> 02:57:33,599
blame these things that are happening on

5550
02:57:32,000 --> 02:57:35,840
the foreigners and

5551
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:37,359
avoid like actually grappling with the

5552
02:57:35,840 --> 02:57:38,960
facts that like well no actually you

5553
02:57:37,359 --> 02:57:39,439
have people in your very own community

5554
02:57:38,959 --> 02:57:40,799
who just

5555
02:57:39,439 --> 02:57:42,960
disagree with you and have a different

5556
02:57:40,799 --> 02:57:44,478
belief and

5557
02:57:42,959 --> 02:57:46,559
i think you know i feel like the

5558
02:57:44,478 --> 02:57:48,559
ethereum community like during that time

5559
02:57:46,559 --> 02:57:49,920
did not do a very good job of grappling

5560
02:57:48,559 --> 02:57:50,639
with that and i feel like like i during

5561
02:57:49,920 --> 02:57:52,559
that time

5562
02:57:50,639 --> 02:57:53,680
did not do a very good job of grappling

5563
02:57:52,559 --> 02:57:55,119
with that and so

5564
02:57:53,680 --> 02:57:57,200
there was a lot of like blaming the

5565
02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:59,680
bitcoiners there were also even

5566
02:57:57,200 --> 02:58:01,520
a lot of people calling for us to use

5567
02:57:59,680 --> 02:58:02,479
trademark one like basically sue

5568
02:58:01,520 --> 02:58:04,079
exchanges

5569
02:58:02,478 --> 02:58:05,679
and like try to prevent them from

5570
02:58:04,079 --> 02:58:07,359
listing ethereum classic

5571
02:58:05,680 --> 02:58:10,239
and like to me that was very unethical

5572
02:58:07,359 --> 02:58:10,239
right like this uh

5573
02:58:10,318 --> 02:58:13,519
using like basically using the

5574
02:58:12,159 --> 02:58:16,318
government as

5575
02:58:13,520 --> 02:58:18,000
a weapon to uh try to attack the other

5576
02:58:16,318 --> 02:58:20,079
cryptocurrency and like destroy

5577
02:58:18,000 --> 02:58:21,680
it as like goes completely against them

5578
02:58:20,079 --> 02:58:23,359
you know the ideals of freedom and you

5579
02:58:21,680 --> 02:58:25,680
know like things that at least

5580
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:26,640
in theory were supposed to stand for um

5581
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:28,880
but

5582
02:58:26,639 --> 02:58:29,840
you know like in that particular time

5583
02:58:28,879 --> 02:58:31,519
like basically

5584
02:58:29,840 --> 02:58:33,279
what was happening was that you know the

5585
02:58:31,520 --> 02:58:35,120
etc price was rising and at the same

5586
02:58:33,279 --> 02:58:36,079
time the th price was dropping in

5587
02:58:35,120 --> 02:58:37,600
lockstep

5588
02:58:36,079 --> 02:58:39,279
and it really and there are a lot of

5589
02:58:37,600 --> 02:58:40,880
bitcoin people basically saying this is

5590
02:58:39,279 --> 02:58:42,800
the end of ethereum and i think a lot of

5591
02:58:40,879 --> 02:58:44,478
people really were afraid that

5592
02:58:42,799 --> 02:58:46,000
ethereum would be just like completely

5593
02:58:44,478 --> 02:58:48,719
destroyed as a result of this

5594
02:58:46,000 --> 02:58:49,680
and so like that's where the anger came

5595
02:58:48,719 --> 02:58:51,438
from exactly that's

5596
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:53,520
yeah exactly it came from the fear and

5597
02:58:51,439 --> 02:58:55,680
like that's what i like

5598
02:58:53,520 --> 02:58:57,359
allowed people to rationalize like in

5599
02:58:55,680 --> 02:58:58,960
abandonment of principles that i think

5600
02:58:57,359 --> 02:59:02,399
they would not have um

5601
02:58:58,959 --> 02:59:05,358
accepted in other circumstances and

5602
02:59:02,398 --> 02:59:06,879
i i definitely like to to some extent

5603
02:59:05,359 --> 02:59:08,239
played along with this myself right and

5604
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:11,039
i do definitely

5605
02:59:08,239 --> 02:59:12,639
regret that to some extent uh well and i

5606
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:15,840
i definitely regret like the

5607
02:59:12,639 --> 02:59:18,478
the excesses completely um but

5608
02:59:15,840 --> 02:59:20,478
so that and then obviously you know

5609
02:59:18,478 --> 02:59:21,599
bitcoin block size war similar sort of

5610
02:59:20,478 --> 02:59:25,278
stuff happened uh

5611
02:59:21,600 --> 02:59:28,720
so like that that insight

5612
02:59:25,279 --> 02:59:30,399
was interesting um because like

5613
02:59:28,719 --> 02:59:31,760
it does mentally make a lot of sense

5614
02:59:30,398 --> 02:59:33,760
right like when you're actually

5615
02:59:31,760 --> 02:59:35,439
afraid that you know unless you act in

5616
02:59:33,760 --> 02:59:36,719
some way that you know your entire world

5617
02:59:35,439 --> 02:59:37,920
is going to collapse like it's much

5618
02:59:36,719 --> 02:59:39,358
easier to just

5619
02:59:37,920 --> 02:59:40,719
rationalize you know forgetting your

5620
02:59:39,359 --> 02:59:41,600
principles and doing whatever you have

5621
02:59:40,719 --> 02:59:43,119
to to just

5622
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:46,079
save the specific thing that you care

5623
02:59:43,120 --> 02:59:46,960
about it feels like the right thing to

5624
02:59:46,079 --> 02:59:50,478
do

5625
02:59:46,959 --> 02:59:51,679
the the brave thing to do is in the face

5626
02:59:50,478 --> 02:59:54,000
of fear

5627
02:59:51,680 --> 02:59:55,520
to still have compassion to still have

5628
02:59:54,000 --> 02:59:58,879
love

5629
02:59:55,520 --> 02:59:59,439
as opposed to hate so the the darkest

5630
02:59:58,879 --> 03:00:01,039
moments

5631
02:59:59,439 --> 03:00:03,200
the the toughest moments of human

5632
03:00:01,040 --> 03:00:07,040
history are those where fear

5633
03:00:03,200 --> 03:00:12,000
is everywhere and despite that

5634
03:00:07,040 --> 03:00:14,319
like the way to get out of that

5635
03:00:12,000 --> 03:00:15,359
is uh is through love not giving into

5636
03:00:14,318 --> 03:00:17,439
the fear and

5637
03:00:15,359 --> 03:00:20,559
again that's the lesson that you draw

5638
03:00:17,439 --> 03:00:24,000
from all those moments of history

5639
03:00:20,559 --> 03:00:25,439
yeah well i i like you have in terms of

5640
03:00:24,000 --> 03:00:26,079
those coffee and the kindness that

5641
03:00:25,439 --> 03:00:28,159
people have

5642
03:00:26,079 --> 03:00:30,318
it does seem that everybody has the

5643
03:00:28,159 --> 03:00:31,520
capacity for evil and everybody has the

5644
03:00:30,318 --> 03:00:33,519
capacity for love

5645
03:00:31,520 --> 03:00:35,120
and you just have to create mechanisms

5646
03:00:33,520 --> 03:00:37,439
and incentives

5647
03:00:35,120 --> 03:00:38,399
that uh prioritize the latter over the

5648
03:00:37,439 --> 03:00:40,079
former

5649
03:00:38,398 --> 03:00:41,920
