1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,480
brian johnson founder of kernel

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,519
a company that has developed devices

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,320
that can monitor

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:12,079
and record brain activity and previously

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,080
he was the founder of braintree

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,560
a mobile payment company that acquired

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,839
venmo and then was acquired by paypal

9
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:19,919
and ebay

10
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:20,879
quick mention of our sponsors for

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,240
sigmatic

12
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:25,839
netsuite grammarly and expressvpn

13
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:27,598
check them out in the description to

14
00:00:25,839 --> 00:00:29,518
support this podcast

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,679
as a side note let me say that this was

16
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,000
a fun and memorable experience

17
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,839
wearing the kernel flow brain interface

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,759
in the beginning of this conversation

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,520
as you can see if you watch the video

20
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,000
version of this episode

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,680
and there's a ubuntu linux machine

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,719
sitting next to me collecting the data

23
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,280
from my brain

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,879
the whole thing gave me hope that the

25
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,359
mystery of the human mind

26
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,119
will be unlocked in the coming decades

27
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,679
as we begin to measure signals from the

28
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,919
brain

29
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:57,759
in a high bandwidth way to understand

30
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,800
the mind we either have to

31
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:03,119
build it or to measure it both

32
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,719
are worth a try thanks to brian and the

33
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:06,239
rest of the colonel team for making this

34
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,798
little demo happen

35
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,359
this is the lex friedman podcast and

36
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,118
here

37
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:15,840
is my conversation with brian johnson

38
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,560
you ready lex yes i'm ready do you guys

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,880
want to come in

40
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,240
and put the interfaces on our heads and

41
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,000
then i will proceed to tell you a few

42
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,719
jokes

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,040
so we uh we have two incredible pieces

44
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:29,679
of technology and

45
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,400
a machine running ubuntu 2004 in front

46
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:32,079
of us

47
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,439
what are we doing all right are these

48
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:34,078
going on our heads they're going on our

49
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:38,399
heads yeah

50
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:41,839
and they will place it on our heads for

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,439
proper alignment

52
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,040
does this support giant heads because i

53
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:48,239
kind of have a giant head

54
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
is this is just as like an ego or are

55
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:55,519
you saying

56
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:59,199
physically both

57
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:59,200
it's a nice massage yes

58
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,478
okay how does it feel it moves around

59
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:08,099
it's okay to move around yeah it feels

60
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,800
oh yeah

61
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:13,519
[Music]

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,520
this feels awesome thank you that feels

63
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,920
good

64
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,040
so this is big head friendly it suits

65
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:22,399
you well lex

66
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:25,120
thank you i

67
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,640
feel like i need to uh i feel like when

68
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,599
i wear this i need to sound like sam

69
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:31,679
harris calm

70
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:34,399
collected eloquent

71
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,000
i feel smarter actually i don't think

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,519
i've ever felt

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,360
quite as much like i'm part of the

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,280
future as now have you ever

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,480
worn a brain interface or had your brain

76
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,598
imaged

77
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,439
oh uh never had my brain imaged

78
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,439
the only way i've analyzed my brain is

79
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,719
by uh

80
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,280
talking to myself and thinking no direct

81
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,878
data

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,280
yeah yeah that is it that is definitely

83
00:02:54,878 --> 00:02:59,439
an interface

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,400
that has a lot of blind spots it has

85
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,318
some blind spots

86
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:08,080
yeah psychotherapy that's right

87
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:08,079
all right are we recording

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:15,200
all right so lex the objective

89
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:15,199
of this i'm going to

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,879
tell you some jokes and your objective

91
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,079
is to not smile

92
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,959
which as a russian you should have an

93
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,760
edge

94
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,759
make the motherland proud i gotcha okay

95
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,840
let's hear the jokes lex and this is

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,840
from the kernel crew

97
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,959
we've been working on a device that can

98
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,479
read your mind

99
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,479
and we would love to see your thoughts

100
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:47,840
is that the joke that's the opening okay

101
00:03:49,598 --> 00:03:52,798
if if i'm if i'm seeing the muscle

102
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:54,479
activation correctly on your

103
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,000
on your lips you're not gonna do well on

104
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:57,679
this let's see all right here here comes

105
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,080
the first unscrewed here comes the first

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,438
one

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,480
is this gonna break the device is it

108
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:05,919
resilient

109
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,919
to uh to laughter

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:16,079
lex what goes through a potato's brain

111
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:18,000
i got already failed that's the

112
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,918
hilarious opener okay

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,918
what tater thoughts

114
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:31,918
what kind of fish performs brain surgery

115
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,919
i don't know a neural surgeon

116
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,040
and so we're getting data of everything

117
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,120
that's happening in my brain right now

118
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,439
lifetime yeah we're getting

119
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,800
activation patterns of your entire

120
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:46,800
cortex

121
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,319
i'm gonna try to do better i'll edit out

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,639
all the parts where i left

123
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:52,240
photoshop you serious face over me you

124
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,439
can recover

125
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:58,319
all right lex what do scholars eat

126
00:04:55,439 --> 00:04:59,199
when they're hungry i don't know what

127
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,519
academia

128
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,520
nuts

129
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:10,079
that's a pretty one so what we'll do

130
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,759
is so you're wearing

131
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:16,560
kernel flow which is

132
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,639
an interface built uh using technology

133
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,600
called spectroscopy so it's similar to

134
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,478
what we wear

135
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,639
wearables on the wrist using light so

136
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:27,758
using lidar as you know

137
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,439
and we're using that to image

138
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,479
it's a functional imaging of brain

139
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:35,199
activity and so as your neurons fire

140
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:35,918
electrically and and chemically it

141
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,520
creates

142
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,279
uh blood oxygenation levels we're

143
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,038
measuring that and so in you'll see in

144
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:42,478
the reconstructions we do for you

145
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,639
you'll see your activation patterns in

146
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:45,758
your brain as throughout this entire

147
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
time we are wearing it

148
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,319
so in the reaction to the jokes and as

149
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,039
we were sitting here talking

150
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:53,839
so it's a we're moving towards a

151
00:05:53,038 --> 00:05:56,959
real-time

152
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:58,159
feed of your cortical brain activity so

153
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:01,599
there's a bunch of

154
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,759
things that are in contact with my skull

155
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,199
right now how many of them are there and

156
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,479
so how many of them are

157
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,319
what are they what are the actual

158
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:11,360
sensors there's 52

159
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,240
modules and each module has one laser

160
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,160
and six

161
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,038
sensors and they're the sensors fire

162
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,360
uh in about 100 picoseconds and then the

163
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:23,599
photons scatter and absorb in your brain

164
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,439
and then a few go in if you come back

165
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,720
out they a bunch go in that a fuel come

166
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:28,399
back out and we

167
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,240
sense those photons and then we do the

168
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,478
reconstruction for the activity

169
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
overall there's about a thousand plus

170
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:35,839
channels

171
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,199
that are sampling your activity how

172
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:38,638
difficult is it to make it as

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,720
comfortable as it is

174
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:44,240
because it's surprisingly comfortable i

175
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,840
would not think it would be comfortable

176
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,240
something that's measuring brain

177
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,119
activity

178
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,759
i would not think it would be

179
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,879
comfortable but it is i agree in fact i

180
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,520
want to take this home

181
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:56,319
yeah yeah that's right so people are

182
00:06:55,519 --> 00:07:00,560
accustomed

183
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:03,280
to being in big systems like fmri where

184
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,240
there's 120 decibel sounds and you're in

185
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:07,758
a claustrophobic

186
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,639
encasement or eeg which is just painful

187
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,280
or surgery and so yes i agree that this

188
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,960
is a

189
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:15,198
convenient option to be able to just put

190
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,359
on your head it measures your brain

191
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,720
activity in the contextual environment

192
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,319
you choose so if we

193
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,440
want to have it during the podcast if we

194
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,560
want to be at home in a business setting

195
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:28,079
so we it's freedom to be where to record

196
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,879
your brain activity in the setting that

197
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,240
you choose

198
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:32,319
yeah but sort of from an engineering

199
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
perspective are these uh

200
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,319
what is it there's a bunch of different

201
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,160
modular parts and they're kind of

202
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,720
there's like a rubber band thing where

203
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,599
they they mold to the shape of your head

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,360
that's right so we we built this this

205
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:49,598
version of the mechanical design

206
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,598
to accommodate most adult heads

207
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,759
but i have a giant head and if it's fine

208
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:58,240
it feels fits well actually

209
00:07:53,759 --> 00:08:00,720
so i don't think i have an average head

210
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,400
okay maybe i feel i feel much better

211
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,080
about my head now maybe i'm

212
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:08,638
uh i'm more average than i thought

213
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,758
okay so what else is there interesting

214
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,360
you could say what's up

215
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,560
while it's on our heads i can keep this

216
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,439
on the whole time this is kind of

217
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,519
awesome

218
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:17,360
and it's amazing for me as a fan of

219
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:17,918
ubuntu i use a bunch of mate you guys

220
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
should use

221
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:22,399
that too but it's amazing to have code

222
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
running

223
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,079
to the side measuring stuff and

224
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:29,359
collecting data

225
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,240
i mean that i just i feel like much more

226
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,639
important now

227
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,360
that my data is being recorded like

228
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:34,958
somebody care

229
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
like you know when you you have a good

230
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,278
friend that listens to you

231
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,879
that actually like listens like actually

232
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,679
is listening to you this is what i feel

233
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:43,278
like

234
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,599
i'm like a much better friend because

235
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:49,120
it's like accurately listening to me

236
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,560
upon two what a cool perspective i

237
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,639
hadn't thought about that

238
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:58,399
of feeling understood yeah heard

239
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:59,120
yeah heard deeply by the mechanical

240
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,919
system

241
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,360
that is recording your brain activity

242
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,879
versus the human

243
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,680
that you're engaging with that your mind

244
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:09,600
immediately goes to

245
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:10,879
that there's this dimensionality and

246
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,639
depth of understanding

247
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,480
yeah of this software system which

248
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,639
you're intimately familiar with

249
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
and now you're able to communicate with

250
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,120
this system in ways that you couldn't

251
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,839
before

252
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,839
yeah i feel heard

253
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,080
yeah i mean i guess what's interesting

254
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:29,838
about this is your intuitions are

255
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,759
spot on most people have intuitions

256
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,959
about brain interfaces that

257
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:35,519
they've grown up with this idea of

258
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,838
people moving cursors on the screen or

259
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,039
typing or changing the channel or

260
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,480
skipping a song it's

261
00:09:39,039 --> 00:09:44,799
primarily been anchored on control and

262
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,519
i think the more relevant understanding

263
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:47,679
of brain

264
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,679
interfaces or neural imaging is that

265
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:52,239
it's a measurement system

266
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:53,120
and once you have numbers for a given

267
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
thing

268
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,159
a seemingly endless number of

269
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,680
possibilities emerge around that of what

270
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,120
to do with those numbers

271
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:00,719
so before you tell me about the

272
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
possibilities this was an incredible

273
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,759
experience

274
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,959
i can keep this on for another two hours

275
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:08,879
but i'm being

276
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:10,319
told that uh for a bunch of reasons

277
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,720
just because we probably want to keep

278
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,399
the data small and visualize it nicely

279
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,000
for the final product we want to cut

280
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,919
this off and take this

281
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,039
to take this amazing helmet away from me

282
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,399
so

283
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,159
brian thank you so much for this

284
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:25,200
experience and let's uh

285
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,078
let's continue without helmetless all

286
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,800
right

287
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:29,919
so that was an incredible experience uh

288
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:31,919
can you maybe speak to

289
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:33,679
what kind of opportunities that opens up

290
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:35,439
that stream of data that rich stream of

291
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:38,319
data from the brain

292
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,959
first i'm curious what is your reaction

293
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,040
what

294
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,719
what comes to mind when you put that on

295
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,199
your head what does it mean to you

296
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,879
and what possibilities emerge and what

297
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
significance might it have i mean i'm

298
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:51,360
curious where

299
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,000
your orientation is at well

300
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,879
for me i'm really excited by the

301
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,879
possibility of

302
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,839
various information about my body about

303
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,000
my mind

304
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,200
being converted into data such that data

305
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,440
can be used to create

306
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,800
products that make my life better so

307
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,680
that that means really exciting

308
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,159
possibility

309
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:12,958
even just like a fitbit that measures i

310
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,120
don't know

311
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,039
some very basic measurements about your

312
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,200
body is really cool

313
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,399
but it's the the bandwidth of

314
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,000
information

315
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,839
the resolution of that information is

316
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,720
very crude so it's not very interesting

317
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:29,440
the possibility of recording of just

318
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,680
building a data set

319
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,120
coming in a clean way in a high

320
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,239
bandwidth way from

321
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,360
my brain opens up uh

322
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,440
all kinds of you know at the very i was

323
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,560
kind of joking when we're talking but

324
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,600
it's not really it's like i feel heard

325
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:50,159
in the sense that it feels like

326
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,600
the full richness of the information

327
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:55,278
coming from my mind

328
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,639
is actually being recorded by the

329
00:11:55,278 --> 00:12:00,240
machine i mean there's a i can't

330
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,720
i can't quite put it into words but

331
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,320
there is a genuinely for me

332
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,240
this is not some kind of joke about me

333
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,680
being a robot is this genuinely feels

334
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,519
like i'm being

335
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:14,319
heard uh in a way that uh

336
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,240
that's going to improve my life as long

337
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,680
as the thing that's on the other end

338
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,839
can do something useful with that data

339
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:23,278
but even the the recording itself

340
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,279
is like once you record it's like taking

341
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:28,399
a picture

342
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:32,320
that moment is forever saved in time

343
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,720
now a picture cannot allow you to step

344
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,000
back

345
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,040
into that world but perhaps

346
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,120
recording your brain is a much higher

347
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,159
resolution thing

348
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:46,078
much more personal recording of that

349
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,240
information than a picture

350
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:49,278
that would allow you to step back into

351
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,680
that

352
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,399
where you were in that particular moment

353
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,239
in history

354
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,799
and then map out a certain trajectory to

355
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,200
tell you certain things about

356
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:00,319
uh about yourself that could open up all

357
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,560
kinds of applications

358
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,680
of course there's health that i consider

359
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,599
but honestly

360
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,679
to me the exciting thing is just being

361
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,519
heard my state of mind

362
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:10,799
the level of focus all those kinds of

363
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,799
things being heard

364
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,479
what i heard you say is you have an

365
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,399
entirety of

366
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,759
lived experience some of which you can

367
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,480
communicate in words

368
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:21,360
and in body language some of which you

369
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,200
feel internally

370
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,959
which cannot be captured in those

371
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,560
communication modalities and that this

372
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,119
measurement system

373
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:30,479
captures both the things you can try to

374
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,120
articulate in words maybe in a lower

375
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,800
dimensional

376
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,159
space using one word for example to

377
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,519
communicate focus

378
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:37,439
yeah when it really may be represented

379
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:40,480
in a 20 dimensional space of

380
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,639
this particular kind of focus and that

381
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,639
this information is being captured so

382
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,079
it's a closer representation to the

383
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,000
entirety

384
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:49,278
of your experience captured in a dynamic

385
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,078
fashion that is not just

386
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:53,039
a static image of your conscious

387
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,919
experience

388
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,360
yeah yeah that that's that's that's the

389
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,159
promise that's the hope that was the

390
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,919
feeling

391
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,078
and it felt like the future so it's a

392
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:02,719
pretty cool experience and from the sort

393
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:05,198
of

394
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,040
mechanical perspective it was cool to

395
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:09,679
have an actual device that

396
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,599
feels pretty good that doesn't uh

397
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,278
doesn't require me to go into the lab

398
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,440
and also the other thing i was i was

399
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,000
feeling there's a guy named andrew

400
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,839
huberman

401
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,759
he's a friend of mine amazing podcast

402
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,519
people should uh uh should listen to a

403
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:24,240
humor in the lab podcast

404
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:26,320
we're working on a paper together about

405
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,320
eye movement and so on

406
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,839
and we're kind of he's a neuroscientist

407
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,879
and i'm a data person a machine learning

408
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,720
person and

409
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:38,639
we're we're both excited by

410
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:41,920
how much the that

411
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,799
how much the data measurements of the

412
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,719
human mind

413
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,838
the brain and all the different metrics

414
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,800
that come from that

415
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,120
can be used to understand human beings

416
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,719
and

417
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,240
in a rigorous scientific way so the

418
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,920
other thing i was thinking about is how

419
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,720
this could be turned into

420
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:58,399
a tool for science sort of not just

421
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,399
personal science not just like

422
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,879
fitbit style like uh how am i doing

423
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,039
my personal metrics of health but doing

424
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,679
larger scale studies of human behavior

425
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,919
and so on

426
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,759
so like data not at the scale of an

427
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,120
individual but data at a scale of many

428
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:14,000
individuals or a large number of

429
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,480
individuals so

430
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,679
science so it's personal being heard was

431
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,039
exciting and also just

432
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:23,359
for science is exciting it's very easy

433
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:25,599
like there's a very powerful thing to it

434
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,560
being so easy to just put on

435
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,079
that you can scale much easier if you

436
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,078
think about the second thing you said

437
00:15:30,078 --> 00:15:35,198
about

438
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:38,719
the science of

439
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:40,958
the brain most

440
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,199
we've done a pretty good job like we the

441
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:45,518
human race has done a pretty good job

442
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,120
figuring out how to quantify the things

443
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:50,159
around us from distance

444
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,879
stars to calories and steps

445
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:53,519
and our genome so we can measure and

446
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,679
quantify

447
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,759
pretty much everything in the known

448
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:01,599
universe

449
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,199
except for our minds and we can do these

450
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,759
one-offs if we're going to get an fmri

451
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:08,719
scan or

452
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,079
do something with the low-res eeg system

453
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,320
but we haven't done this at

454
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:13,919
population scale and so if you think

455
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,480
about

456
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,679
human thought or human cognition is

457
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,199
probably

458
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:23,758
the single law largest raw input

459
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:24,639
material into society at any given

460
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,079
moment

461
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,839
it's our conversations with our with

462
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:31,838
ourselves and with other people

463
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,639
and we have this this raw input that we

464
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,120
can't haven't been able to measure yet

465
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,759
yeah

466
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,240
and if you when i think about it through

467
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,240
that frame

468
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,639
it's remarkable it's almost like we live

469
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,559
in this

470
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,079
wild wild west of unquantified

471
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,479
communications within ourselves

472
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,838
and between each other when everything

473
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,759
else has been grounded me for example i

474
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,720
know if i buy an appliance at this

475
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,759
at the store or on a website i don't

476
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,720
need to

477
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,919
look at the measurements on the

478
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,879
appliance make sure it can fit through

479
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:05,359
my door

480
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,038
that's an engineered system of appliance

481
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,719
manufacturing and construction

482
00:17:07,038 --> 00:17:11,838
everyone's agreed upon

483
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,720
engineering standards and we don't

484
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:16,480
have engineering standards around

485
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,078
cognition it's not a for it has not

486
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,120
entered as a formal engineering

487
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:21,678
discipline

488
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,038
that enables us to scaffold in society

489
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,439
with everything else we're doing

490
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:26,480
including consuming news our

491
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,120
relationships

492
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,519
politics economics education all the

493
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,719
above

494
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:35,200
and so to me that the most significant

495
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,400
contribution that kernel technology has

496
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,080
to offer

497
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,360
would be the formal sca the

498
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,599
introduction of the formal engineering

499
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,119
of cognition as it relates to everything

500
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:47,678
else in society

501
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:48,959
i love that i idea that you kind of

502
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,519
think

503
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,360
that there is just this ocean of data

504
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,839
that's coming from people's brains as

505
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:56,879
being in a crude way reduced down to

506
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,480
like

507
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:04,240
tweets and texts and so on just a very

508
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:07,440
hardcore mini scale compression of

509
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,160
actual the raw data but maybe you can

510
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,679
comment

511
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,759
because you use the word cognition

512
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,200
i think the first step is to get the

513
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,240
brain data

514
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,160
but um is there a leap

515
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,079
to be taking to sort of interpreting

516
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,160
that data in terms of cognition

517
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,798
so is your is your ideas basically you

518
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:28,720
need to start collecting data at scale

519
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,400
from the brain and then we start to

520
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:33,839
really be able to

521
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,798
take little steps along the path to

522
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,678
actually

523
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,720
measuring some deep sense of cognition

524
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,440
because it's

525
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,400
you know as i'm sure you know we don't

526
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,240
we understand

527
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,200
a few things but we don't understand

528
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,120
most of what makes up cognition

529
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,720
this has been one of the most

530
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:51,199
significant challenges of building

531
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,960
kernel

532
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,679
and colonel wouldn't exist if i wasn't

533
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,679
able to fund it initially by myself

534
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:59,280
because when i engage in conversations

535
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,360
with investors

536
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,639
the immediate thought is what is the

537
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,399
killer app

538
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,759
and of course i understand that

539
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,919
heuristic that's what they're looking at

540
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,919
is they're looking to de-risk

541
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,520
is the product solved is there a

542
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,960
customer base are people willing to pay

543
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:14,160
for it how does it compare to competing

544
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,519
options

545
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,160
and in the case with brain interfaces

546
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:20,960
when i started the company

547
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,640
there was no known path to even build a

548
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,200
technology that could potentially

549
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,799
become mainstream yes and then once we

550
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,160
figured out the technology

551
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,519
we could even we could commence having

552
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,080
conversations with investors and it

553
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,000
became

554
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:33,199
what is a killer app and so what has

555
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,038
been

556
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,319
so i've funded the first 53 million

557
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:39,038
dollars of the company

558
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,119
and to raise the round of funding the

559
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,640
first one we did i spoke to 228

560
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:45,759
investors

561
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,160
one said yes it was remarkable and it

562
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,798
was

563
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,080
mostly around this concept around what

564
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:51,599
is a killer app and

565
00:19:50,079 --> 00:19:54,000
so internally the way we think about it

566
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:55,918
is we think of the

567
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,839
the go-to-market strategy much more like

568
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,720
the drake equation

569
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,119
where if we can build technology that

570
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,159
has

571
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,519
the characteristics of it has the data

572
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,520
quality is high enough it meets some

573
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:11,038
certain threshold

574
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,079
cost accessibility comfort

575
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:14,720
it can be worn in contextual

576
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:19,439
environments if it meets the criteria

577
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:21,759
of being a mass-market device then

578
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,960
the responsibility that we have is to

579
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,798
figure out how to

580
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:29,840
create the algorithm that enables

581
00:20:26,798 --> 00:20:32,000
the human to enable

582
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,240
uh humans to then find value with it

583
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,839
okay so it so the analogy is like

584
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,519
brain interfaces are like early 90s of

585
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,599
the internet is you

586
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:40,798
you want to populate an ecosystem with a

587
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:41,678
certain number of devices you want a

588
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:42,879
certain number of people

589
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,000
who play around with them who do

590
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,760
experiments of certain data collection

591
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,919
parameters you want to encourage certain

592
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:48,558
mistakes from experts to non-experts

593
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,840
these are all

594
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,158
critical elements that ignite discovery

595
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,158
and so

596
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:59,119
we believe we've accomplished the first

597
00:20:57,038 --> 00:21:02,079
objective building technology

598
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:04,558
that reaches those thresholds and now

599
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,720
it's the drake equation component of

600
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:11,759
how do we try to

601
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,960
generate 20 years of value discovery in

602
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,240
a two or three year time period how do

603
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,000
we compress that

604
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,440
so just to clarify so when you mean the

605
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,119
drake equation

606
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,558
uh which for people who don't know i

607
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:21,918
don't know why you if you listen to this

608
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:22,879
i bring up aliens every single

609
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,919
conversation so

610
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,400
it's i don't know how you would know

611
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:29,360
what the drake equation is but you mean

612
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,200
like the killer app it would be one

613
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,158
alien civilization in that equation

614
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,120
so meaning like this is in search of an

615
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,799
application that's

616
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:38,239
impactful transformative by the way it

617
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:39,200
should be a we need to come up with a

618
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,640
better term

619
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,038
than killer app as a it's also violent

620
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,120
right

621
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,158
very violent you can go like viral app

622
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:50,239
that's horrible too

623
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:52,480
right it's some very uh inspiringly

624
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,558
impactful application how about that no

625
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,279
yeah okay so let's stick with killer app

626
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:58,319
that's fine

627
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:01,359
nobody's but i concur with you i dislike

628
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:02,079
the chosen words in in capturing the

629
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:03,759
concept

630
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,439
you know it's one of those sticky things

631
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:08,480
that uh is as

632
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,120
effective to use in the tech world but

633
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,000
when you

634
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:13,359
now become a communicator outside of the

635
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,599
tech world especially when you're

636
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,439
talking about software and hardware and

637
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,399
artificial intelligence applications it

638
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,038
sounds horrible you know it's

639
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,880
interesting i

640
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,558
i actually regret now having called

641
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,080
attention because i regret having used

642
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,279
that word in this conversation

643
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:27,839
because it's something i would not

644
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,440
normally do i i used it

645
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,119
in order to create a bridge of shared

646
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,720
understanding of how others would what

647
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:36,158
terminology others would use

648
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:40,000
yeah but yeah i concur let's go with the

649
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:42,320
impactful application value creation

650
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,440
value creation something people love

651
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:46,720
using

652
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,440
there we go that's it love app

653
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,880
okay so what uh do you have any ideas so

654
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,759
you're basically creating a framework

655
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,360
where there's

656
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:58,400
the possibility of a discovery of uh

657
00:22:55,359 --> 00:23:00,399
an application that people love using

658
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,240
is do you have ideas we've began to play

659
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,519
a fun game internally where when we have

660
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:08,400
these discussions and we

661
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:10,480
begin circling around this concept of

662
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,840
does anybody have an idea does anyone

663
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,240
have intuitions and

664
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:15,759
if we see the conversation starting to

665
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,679
to veer in that direction

666
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:22,240
we flag it and say human intuition alert

667
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,120
stop it and so we really want to focus

668
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,599
on the algorithm

669
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:27,119
of there's a natural process of human

670
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:29,519
discovery

671
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:31,439
that that when you populate a system

672
00:23:29,519 --> 00:23:33,200
with devices and you give people the

673
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,440
opportunity to play around with it in

674
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,400
expected and unexpected ways

675
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,080
we are thinking that is a much better

676
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,600
system of discovery

677
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:42,720
than us exercising tuitions and it's

678
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,399
interesting we're also seeing a few

679
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,079
neural scientists who have been

680
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,600
have been talking to us where i was

681
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,079
speaking just one young

682
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:51,359
associate professor and i approached a

683
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,839
conversation and said hey

684
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:56,158
we have these five data streams that

685
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:58,000
we're pulling off

686
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,440
when you hear that what weighted value

687
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,480
do you add to each data source like

688
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,679
which one do you think is going to be

689
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,679
valuable for your objectives

690
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,679
and which one's not and he said i don't

691
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,120
care just give me the data

692
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,919
all i care about is my machine learning

693
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:11,678
model but importantly he did not have a

694
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,799
theory of mind he did not come to the

695
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,960
table and say i think

696
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:16,158
the brain operates you know in this way

697
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,960
and these regions that have these these

698
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,880
functions

699
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,720
he didn't care he just wanted the data

700
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,799
and we're seeing that more and more

701
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,798
that certain people

702
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:27,918
are devaluing human intuitions for good

703
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,119
reasons as we've seen in machine

704
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,799
learning over

705
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:32,798
over the past couple years and we're

706
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,918
doing the same in our value creation

707
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:40,400
uh market strategy

708
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:42,000
so more collect more data clean data

709
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,600
make uh the products such that the

710
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,038
collection of data is uh

711
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,480
easy and and and fun and then the the

712
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,200
rest will just

713
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,919
spring to life that's right through

714
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,360
humans

715
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,919
playing around with them our objective

716
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,918
is to create the most valuable

717
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,960
data collection system of the brain ever

718
00:25:03,278 --> 00:25:10,558
and with that then applying all the

719
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:14,000
best tools of machine learning and other

720
00:25:10,558 --> 00:25:16,480
techniques to extract out you know

721
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,400
to try to find insight but yes our

722
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,480
objective is really to systematize the

723
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:23,120
discovery process because we

724
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,919
we can't put definite time frames on

725
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,839
discovery

726
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,000
the brain is complicated and and science

727
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,918
is not a business strategy

728
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,519
and so we really need to figure out how

729
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,720
to

730
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:36,400
this is the difficulty of bringing

731
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,278
bringing you know technology like this

732
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,360
to market it's why

733
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:40,319
most of the time it just ling it

734
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,798
languishes

735
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,319
in academia academia for quite some time

736
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,240
but we hope that

737
00:25:44,319 --> 00:25:48,879
we will over you know cross over and

738
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,240
make this mainstream in the coming years

739
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,960
the thing was cool to wear but what's uh

740
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,558
are you chasing a good reason for

741
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,960
millions of people to put it

742
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:00,798
this on their head and keep on their

743
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,919
head regularly

744
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:04,639
is there um like who's going to discover

745
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,799
that reason

746
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,000
is it going to be people just kind of

747
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,879
organically

748
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,400
or is there going to be a angry bird

749
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,000
style application

750
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,278
that's just uh too exciting to

751
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
to not use if i think through the things

752
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:22,400
that

753
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,440
have changed my life most significantly

754
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,159
over the past few years

755
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,038
when i started wearing a wearable in my

756
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,720
wrist

757
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,480
that would give me data about my heart

758
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,720
rate heart rate variability respiration

759
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,720
rate

760
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:38,879
metabolic approximations etc

761
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:40,158
for the first time in my life i had

762
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,480
access to information

763
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,278
uh sleep patterns that were highly

764
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,798
impactful

765
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:49,200
they they told me for example if i eat

766
00:26:46,798 --> 00:26:50,798
close to bedtime i'm not going to get

767
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,558
deep sleep

768
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,079
and not getting deep sleep means you

769
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:55,200
have all these follow-on consequences in

770
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:57,278
life and so

771
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,360
it opened up this window of

772
00:26:57,278 --> 00:27:02,640
understanding of myself

773
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:04,079
that i cannot self-introspect and deduce

774
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,400
these things this is information that

775
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:06,558
was

776
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,679
available to be acquired but it just

777
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:09,038
wasn't i would have to

778
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,798
get an expensive sleep study then it's

779
00:27:09,038 --> 00:27:11,519
an end like one night and that's not

780
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,759
good enough to look

781
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,200
to run all my trials and so if you look

782
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:18,319
just at the information

783
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:19,360
that one can acquire on their wrist and

784
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:21,519
now you're applying planted to the

785
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:23,439
entire cortex on the brain

786
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:24,960
and you say what kind of information

787
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,440
could we acquire

788
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,240
it opens up a whole new universe of

789
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,679
possibilities

790
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,038
for example we did this internal study

791
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,480
at kernel where i wore a prototype

792
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:34,798
device

793
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,159
and we were measuring the cognitive

794
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:38,879
effects of sleep

795
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,480
so i had a device measuring my sleep i

796
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,559
performed with 13 of my

797
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,319
my co-workers we performed four

798
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:46,960
cognitive tasks over

799
00:27:44,319 --> 00:27:47,359
13 sessions and we focused on reaction

800
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,880
time

801
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:53,678
impulse control short-term memory

802
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,000
and then a resting state task and we

803
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,840
with mine we found for example that

804
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,119
my impulse control was independently

805
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,480
correlated with my sleep

806
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,719
outside of behavioral measures of my

807
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,319
ability to play the game the point

808
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:09,519
of the study was i had the brain study i

809
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:14,319
did at colonel

810
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:17,918
confirmed my life experience that if i

811
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:19,359
my deep sleep determined whether or not

812
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,759
i would be able to resist

813
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:23,359
temptation the following day and my

814
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,278
brain didn't show that

815
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,798
as one example and so if you start

816
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,319
thinking if you actually have

817
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:30,079
uh data on yourself on your on your

818
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:34,639
entire cortex you can control the

819
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:36,879
settings i think there's probably an

820
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,000
uh a large number of things that we

821
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,000
could discover about ourselves

822
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,000
very very small and very very big i just

823
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,278
for example like when you read

824
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,599
news what's going on like when you use

825
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:50,159
social media when you use news what

826
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,199
like uh all the ways we allocate

827
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,880
attention

828
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,558
that's right with the computer i mean

829
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,360
that seems like a compelling place to

830
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:58,558
where you would

831
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:00,479
want to put on uh kernel by the way what

832
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,678
is it called kernel flux kernel like

833
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,720
what flow

834
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,278
fluid yeah two technologies uh flow flow

835
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,919
okay so when you when you put on the the

836
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:09,919
kernel flow

837
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:16,239
it it is seems like to be um

838
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,519
a compelling time and place to do it is

839
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,480
when you're behind a desk behind a

840
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:19,759
computer

841
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,599
because you could probably wear it for

842
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:23,599
prolonged periods of time

843
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,119
as you're as you're taking in content

844
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,519
and there could a lot of

845
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:29,839
because some of our so much of our lives

846
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,720
happens in the digital world now

847
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:34,558
that kind of coupling the information

848
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,000
about the human mind

849
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:40,158
with the consumption and the behaviors

850
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,000
in the digital world might give us a lot

851
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,000
of information about the effects

852
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,038
of the way we behave and navigate the

853
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,640
digital world

854
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:51,038
to the actual physical meat space

855
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,799
uh effects on our body it's interesting

856
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:56,798
to think so in terms of both like

857
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:59,839
for work i i'm a big fan of uh

858
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:03,519
cal newport his ideas of deep work

859
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:05,678
that uh i spend uh

860
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,000
with few exceptions i try to spend the

861
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,159
first two hours of every day

862
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,278
usually if i'm like at home and have

863
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,559
nothing on my schedule

864
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,798
is going to be up to eight hours of deep

865
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:18,960
work or focus zero distraction

866
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,278
and for me to analyze the i mean i'm

867
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,759
very aware of the

868
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:24,720
uh the waning of that the ups and downs

869
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,038
of that

870
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,480
and it's almost like you you're surfing

871
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,558
the ups and downs of that as you're

872
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,399
doing programming as you're doing

873
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:33,759
thinking about particular problems

874
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:34,479
you're trying to visualize things in

875
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:37,200
your mind you

876
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,558
start trying to stitch them together

877
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,880
you're trying to uh

878
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,079
when there's a dead end about an idea

879
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,440
you have to kind of

880
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:47,439
calmly like walk back and start again

881
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,679
all those kinds of processes it'd be

882
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,960
interesting to get data on what my mind

883
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,360
is actually doing

884
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,240
and also recently started doing uh i

885
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:57,119
just talked to

886
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,880
sam harris a few days ago and been uh

887
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:02,158
building up to that i started using

888
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,799
started meditating using his app waking

889
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,519
up but

890
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:07,359
very much uh recommend it it'd be

891
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,759
interesting to get data on that

892
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,359
because it's you're very it's like

893
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,759
you're removing all the noise

894
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:15,839
from your head and you're very much it's

895
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:19,038
an active process of

896
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:19,759
active noise removal active noise

897
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:22,640
cancelling

898
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:24,158
like the headphones and it'd be

899
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,519
interesting to see what is going on in

900
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,760
the mind

901
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,200
uh before the meditation during it and

902
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:30,640
after all those kinds of things

903
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,240
and in all of your examples it's

904
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,720
interesting that

905
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,640
everyone who's designed an experience

906
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,038
for you so whether it be the meditation

907
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,200
app

908
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,398
or the deep work or with all the things

909
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,600
you mentioned

910
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:44,319
they constructed this product with a

911
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:48,000
certain

912
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:50,398
number of knowns yeah now what if

913
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
we expanded the number of knowns by 10x

914
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:54,079
or 20x or 30x

915
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,079
they would reconstruct their product

916
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:58,398
cool incorporate those known so it'd be

917
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:59,119
yeah and so this is the dimensionality

918
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,599
that i think is

919
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,038
the promising aspect is that people will

920
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,199
be able to

921
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,319
use this quantification use this

922
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,360
information

923
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,639
to build more effective products and

924
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,119
this is i'm not talking about

925
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,360
better products to advertise to you or

926
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:19,038
manipulate you i'm talking about uh

927
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,398
our focus is helping people individuals

928
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,640
have this contextual awareness and

929
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:24,158
quantification and then to engage with

930
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,159
others who are

931
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,120
seeking to improve people's lives that

932
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:31,440
the objective is

933
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:32,479
is betterment across ourselves

934
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,080
individually and also

935
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,440
uh with each other yeah so it's a nice

936
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:36,000
data stream to have if you're building

937
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,360
an app

938
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,798
like if you're building a podcast

939
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:40,240
listening app it would be nice to know

940
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,319
data about the listener

941
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,480
so that like if you're bored or you fell

942
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:47,119
asleep maybe pause the podcast

943
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,240
it's like really dumb just very simple

944
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:49,759
applications

945
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,839
that could just improve the quality of

946
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:55,119
the experience of the using the app

947
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,639
and imagining if you have you have your

948
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:58,798
neuron this is lex

949
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,840
and you there's a statistical

950
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,558
representation of you

951
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:03,918
and you engage with the app and it says

952
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:08,079
lex

953
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:08,080
your best to engage with this meditation

954
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:12,240
exercise in the following settings at

955
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,240
this time of day

956
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,359
after eating this kind of food or not

957
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,599
eaten fasting

958
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,599
with this level of blood glucose and

959
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,879
this kind of night's sleep

960
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:26,079
but all these data combined

961
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,200
to give you this contextually relevant

962
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:29,359
experience just like we do with our

963
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,759
sleep we you've optimized your entire

964
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,119
life

965
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,079
based upon what information you can

966
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:36,000
acquire and know about yourself

967
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,119
and so the question is how much do we

968
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,640
really know

969
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:40,319
of the things going around us and i

970
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:41,440
would venture to guess in my own my life

971
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:43,599
life experience

972
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,840
i capture my self-awareness captures an

973
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:47,359
extremely small

974
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,199
percent of the things that actually

975
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,038
influence my conscious

976
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,558
and unconscious experience well in some

977
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:55,679
sense the data would

978
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:56,798
help encourage you to be more self-aware

979
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,798
not just because you

980
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:03,359
trust everything the data is saying but

981
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,639
is it'll give you a prod to start

982
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,918
investigating

983
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:11,119
like i would love to get like a a rating

984
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,720
like a ranking of all the things i do

985
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,119
and what are the things this is probably

986
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,959
important to do without the data but the

987
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,159
data will certainly help it's like

988
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,918
rank all the things you do in life and

989
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,519
which ones make you feel shitty which

990
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:25,358
must make you feel good

991
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:26,960
like uh you're talking about evening

992
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:30,159
brian like uh

993
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,440
this is a good example somebody like

994
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,079
i do pig out at night as well

995
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,599
and uh and it never makes like you're in

996
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:40,320
a safe space

997
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,919
this is just a safe space let's hear it

998
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,679
no i i definitely have much less

999
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,398
self-control at night and it's

1000
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,960
interesting

1001
00:34:44,398 --> 00:34:48,559
and the same you know um people might

1002
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,559
criticize this but

1003
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:52,719
i i know my own body i know when i eat

1004
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:56,000
carnivore just eat meat

1005
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:59,279
i feel much better uh

1006
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,199
than uh if i eat more

1007
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,359
more carbs the more cups i eat the worse

1008
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:05,118
i feel i don't know why that is

1009
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:06,639
i don't i there is science supporting

1010
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,760
but i'm not leading on science i'm

1011
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:09,279
leaning on personal experience and

1012
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,839
that's really important

1013
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,599
i don't need to read i'm not going to go

1014
00:35:11,838 --> 00:35:14,639
in a whole rant about nutrition science

1015
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,280
but

1016
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,960
many of those studies are very flawed

1017
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,560
they're doing their best but nutrition

1018
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,440
science is a very difficult

1019
00:35:20,559 --> 00:35:24,239
uh field of study because humans are so

1020
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,159
different

1021
00:35:24,239 --> 00:35:27,598
and the mind has so much impact on the

1022
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,679
way your body

1023
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,519
behaves and it's so difficult from a

1024
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,639
scientific perspective to conduct really

1025
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:34,239
strong studies

1026
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,078
that you have to be almost like a

1027
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:38,078
scientist of an

1028
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,839
of one you have to do these studies on

1029
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:41,599
yourself that's the best way to

1030
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:43,358
understand what works for you or not

1031
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,680
and i don't understand why because it

1032
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:48,159
sounds unhealthy but eating only meat

1033
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,679
always makes me feel good just eat eat

1034
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,598
meat that's it

1035
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:52,799
and i don't have any allergies and you

1036
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,720
know that kind of stuff

1037
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,519
i'm not full like jordan peterson where

1038
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:00,239
like if he like deviates a little bit

1039
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:02,000
that he goes off like deviates a little

1040
00:36:00,239 --> 00:36:04,559
bit from the carnivore diet he goes off

1041
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,039
like the cliff no i can i can have like

1042
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:10,838
chalk i can i can go off the diet i feel

1043
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:13,679
fine it's not it's a it's a gradual

1044
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:16,078
uh it's a gradual worsening

1045
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,279
of how i feel but what i eat only meat i

1046
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,200
feel great

1047
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,839
and it'd be nice to be reminded of that

1048
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:24,159
like there's a very simple fact

1049
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,920
that i feel good when i eat carnivore

1050
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:29,118
and i think that repeats itself in

1051
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,200
all kinds of experiences like i feel

1052
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,400
really good

1053
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:38,480
uh when i exercise

1054
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:40,559
not i hate exercise okay but

1055
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,760
in the rest of the day the the uh the

1056
00:36:40,559 --> 00:36:43,759
impact it has

1057
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,160
on my mind and the clarity of mind and

1058
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,599
the experiences and the happiness and

1059
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,399
all those kinds of things i feel really

1060
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:52,400
good and to be able to

1061
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,000
concretely express that through data

1062
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,760
would be would be nice it would be a

1063
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,480
nice reminder almost like a statement

1064
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:58,160
like

1065
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,880
remember what feels good and what not

1066
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:03,759
and there could be things like

1067
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,200
uh that i'm not many things like just

1068
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,680
you're suggesting that i could

1069
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,039
not be aware of they might be sitting

1070
00:37:07,679 --> 00:37:10,639
right in front of me

1071
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:12,079
that uh make me feel really good and

1072
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,239
make me feel not good

1073
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,079
and the data would show that i agree

1074
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:18,639
with you i've actually

1075
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:20,160
employed the same strategy i i fired my

1076
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,400
mind entirely

1077
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:23,199
from being responsible for constructing

1078
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,039
my diet

1079
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,199
so i started doing a program where i now

1080
00:37:25,039 --> 00:37:30,239
track over 200 biomarkers

1081
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,679
every 90 days and it captures

1082
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:33,519
of course the things you would expect

1083
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:34,399
like cholesterol but also dna

1084
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:36,800
methylation

1085
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,400
and all kinds of things that about my

1086
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,200
body all the processes that make up

1087
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,119
me and then i let that data generate the

1088
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,960
shopping list

1089
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:47,039
and so i never actually ask my mind what

1090
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,800
it wants it's entirely what my body

1091
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,400
is reporting that it wants and so i call

1092
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,359
this goal alignment

1093
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,720
within brian and there's 200 plus actors

1094
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:55,119
that i'm currently asking their opinion

1095
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,879
of

1096
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:58,800
and so i'm asking my liver how are you

1097
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,480
doing and it's expressing

1098
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,160
via the biomarkers and so then i

1099
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,880
construct that diet

1100
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:06,159
and i only eat those foods until my next

1101
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,760
testing round

1102
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:10,799
and that has changed my life more than i

1103
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,880
think anything else

1104
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:17,519
because in the emotion of my conscious

1105
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,280
mind that i gave primacy to my entire

1106
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:20,400
life it led me astray because like you

1107
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,400
were saying

1108
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,039
the mind then goes out into the world

1109
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,920
and it navigates

1110
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,358
the dozens of different dietary regimens

1111
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,358
people put together in books and it all

1112
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:32,719
has

1113
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,480
al their their supporting science in

1114
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:35,519
certain contextual settings but it's not

1115
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,358
n of one

1116
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:38,880
and like you're saying this dietary

1117
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,799
really is an end of one

1118
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,160
these what people have published

1119
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,440
scientifically of course can be used

1120
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:48,480
for nice groundings but it changes when

1121
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,800
you get to the end of one level

1122
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,559
and so that's what gets me excited about

1123
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,920
brainerd faces is if you

1124
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:55,838
if i could do the same thing for my

1125
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,800
brain where i can stop asking my

1126
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:58,639
conscious mind

1127
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,800
for its advice or for its decision

1128
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:02,400
making which is

1129
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:04,640
flawed and i'd rather just look at this

1130
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,000
data that and i've i've never had better

1131
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:06,400
health markers in my life than when i

1132
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,400
stopped

1133
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,519
actually asking myself to be in charge

1134
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,639
of it and

1135
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:14,960
the idea of uh the motion of the

1136
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:18,319
conscious mind

1137
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:21,119
is uh is such a sort of engineering way

1138
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,160
of phrasing like meditation with

1139
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:24,000
what they mean that's what we're doing

1140
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,000
right yeah that's beautiful that means

1141
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,079
really beautifully put

1142
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:29,760
by the way testing around what does that

1143
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,480
look like what's that

1144
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,200
well you mentioned uh yeah the very the

1145
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,240
test i do

1146
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:39,439
yes so includes a complete

1147
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:42,559
blood panel i do a microbiome test i do

1148
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,000
a food inflammation of diet

1149
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,000
induced inflammation so i look for

1150
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,480
excited kind expressions so foods that

1151
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,079
produce inflammatory reactions

1152
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,838
i look at my neural endocrine systems i

1153
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:53,839
look at all my neural transmitters

1154
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,480
i do yeah there's several micronutrient

1155
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,358
tests to see how i'm looking at the very

1156
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:02,639
various nutrients

1157
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:05,039
what about like self report of

1158
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,358
like how you feel you know almost like

1159
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:07,358
um

1160
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,079
you can't demote your con you still

1161
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:15,200
exist within your conscious mind

1162
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,119
right so that lived experience of is of

1163
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:19,598
a lot of value so how do you measure

1164
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,440
that i do a temporal sampling

1165
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,720
over some duration of time so i'll think

1166
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,800
through how i feel

1167
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:27,439
over a week over a month over three

1168
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,880
months i don't do a temporal sampling of

1169
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,318
if i'm at the grocery store in front of

1170
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,160
a cereal box and be like

1171
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:33,440
you know what captain crunch is probably

1172
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:34,318
the right thing for me today because i'm

1173
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:36,480
feeling like

1174
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,079
i need a little fun in my life yeah and

1175
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,920
so it's a temporal sampling if the data

1176
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,079
set's large enough then i i smooth out

1177
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,680
the function of my natural oscillations

1178
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,318
of how i feel about life where some days

1179
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:46,559
i may

1180
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:48,800
feel upset or depressed or down or

1181
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:50,559
whatever and i don't want those moments

1182
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,200
to then rule my decision making that's

1183
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:53,119
why

1184
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,039
the demotion happens and it says really

1185
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,480
if you're looking at health over 90 day

1186
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:59,519
period of time

1187
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,000
all my 200 voices speak up on that

1188
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:02,400
interval

1189
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:04,480
and they're all given voice to say this

1190
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,160
is how i'm doing and this is what i want

1191
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,159
and so it really is an accounting system

1192
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:10,318
for everybody so that's why

1193
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:13,358
i think that if you think about the

1194
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:13,358
future of being human

1195
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,838
there's two things i think that are

1196
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,000
really going on

1197
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:22,880
one is the design manufacturing and

1198
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,639
distribution of intelligence

1199
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,559
is heading towards zero con a cost curve

1200
00:41:26,639 --> 00:41:30,000
over over a certain design over a

1201
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,318
certain time frame

1202
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,039
but our ability to you know evolution

1203
00:41:32,318 --> 00:41:35,679
produced us

1204
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,119
an intelligent form of intelligence we

1205
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,399
are now designing our own intelligence

1206
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,599
systems

1207
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,119
and the design manufacturing

1208
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:41,599
distribution of that intelligence over a

1209
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,760
certain

1210
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:45,039
uh time frame is going to go to a cost

1211
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,960
of zero

1212
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:48,079
design manufacture distribution of

1213
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,199
intelligent

1214
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:52,640
cost is going to zero again

1215
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,399
just give me a second okay that's

1216
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:57,519
brilliant okay

1217
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,960
and evolution is doing the design

1218
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:01,039
manufacturing distribution of

1219
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,039
intelligence and now we are doing

1220
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,318
the design manufacturing distribution of

1221
00:42:03,039 --> 00:42:06,559
intelligence

1222
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:07,519
and the cost of that is going to zero

1223
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,639
that's a very

1224
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,960
uh nice way of looking at life on earth

1225
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:14,000
so if that that's going on and then now

1226
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,519
in parallel

1227
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,920
to that then you say okay what

1228
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:22,559
what then happens if when that cost

1229
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,480
curve is heading

1230
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:28,960
to zero our existence becomes

1231
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:31,199
a goal alignment problem a goal

1232
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,119
alignment function

1233
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:34,719
and so the same thing i'm doing where

1234
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,599
i'm doing goal alignment within myself

1235
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:41,679
of these 200 biomarkers where i'm saying

1236
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,519
when when brian exists on a daily basis

1237
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,199
and this entity is deciding what to eat

1238
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:47,199
what to do and et cetera

1239
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:48,559
it's not just my conscious mind which is

1240
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:50,639
opining it's

1241
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,078
200 biological processes and there's a

1242
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:56,960
whole bunch more voices involved

1243
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:56,960
so in that equation

1244
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,599
we're going to increasingly automate

1245
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,200
the things that we spend high energy on

1246
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,480
today because it's easier

1247
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:10,639
and now we're going to then negotiate

1248
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,318
the terms and conditions of intelligent

1249
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:13,440
life now we say conscious existence

1250
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,880
because we're biased because that's what

1251
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,440
we have

1252
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,039
but it will be the largest computational

1253
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,240
exercise in history because you're now

1254
00:43:19,039 --> 00:43:23,279
doing go alignment

1255
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:24,879
with planet earth within yourself with

1256
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,400
each other

1257
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,240
within all the intelligent agents we're

1258
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,200
building bots and other you know voice

1259
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:30,639
assistants

1260
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:33,199
you basically i don't have a trillions

1261
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:36,559
and trillions of agents working on

1262
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:39,279
the negotiation of goal alignment yeah

1263
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,400
this this is in fact true uh and what

1264
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,200
was the second thing

1265
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,240
that was it so the cost the design

1266
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:45,679
manufacturing distribution of

1267
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:48,479
intelligence going to zero

1268
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:50,159
which then means what's really going on

1269
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,599
what are we really doing

1270
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,279
we're negotiating the terms and

1271
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,200
conditions

1272
00:43:53,280 --> 00:44:00,880
of existence do you worry about

1273
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:00,879
the survival of this process

1274
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:04,799
that uh life as we know it on earth

1275
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,279
comes to an end

1276
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,960
or at least intelligent life that as the

1277
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,240
cost goes to zero

1278
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:13,838
all something happens where uh

1279
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,279
all of that intelligence is thrown in

1280
00:44:13,838 --> 00:44:17,679
the trash by

1281
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,599
something like nuclear war or

1282
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:20,719
development of agi systems that are very

1283
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:23,760
dumb

1284
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:24,799
not agi i guess but ai is just that it's

1285
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:28,240
the paper clip thing

1286
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,920
what on mass is dumb but has unintended

1287
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:30,959
consequences to where it destroys human

1288
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,240
civilization

1289
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,960
do you worry about those kinds of things

1290
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:38,559
i mean it's it's unsurprising

1291
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:41,519
that a new thing comes into

1292
00:44:38,559 --> 00:44:43,838
the sphere of human consciousness humans

1293
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:46,079
identify the foreign object in this case

1294
00:44:43,838 --> 00:44:47,358
artificial intelligence our amygdala

1295
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,640
fires up and says

1296
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:53,440
scary foreign

1297
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:54,318
we should be apprehensive about this and

1298
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,559
so it

1299
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:57,599
makes sense from a biological

1300
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:02,000
perspective that humans

1301
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:06,720
for the the knee-jerk reaction is fear

1302
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,719
what i don't think has been properly

1303
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:13,040
weighted with that is that

1304
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,199
we are the first generation of

1305
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:17,358
intelligent beings on this earth

1306
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:20,318
that has been able to look out over

1307
00:45:17,358 --> 00:45:22,719
their expected lifetime

1308
00:45:20,318 --> 00:45:23,358
and see there is a real possibility of

1309
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:25,039
evolving

1310
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:27,519
into entirely novel forms of

1311
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:30,239
consciousness

1312
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:30,960
yeah so different that it would be

1313
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,358
totally

1314
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,880
unrecognizable to us today we don't have

1315
00:45:33,358 --> 00:45:36,719
words for it we can't hint at it we

1316
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,079
can't point at it we can't

1317
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:39,838
you can't look in the sky and see that

1318
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:40,960
thing that is shining we're going to go

1319
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,599
up there

1320
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,800
you you cannot even create an

1321
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,000
aspirational

1322
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,880
statement about it and

1323
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,838
instead we've had this knee-jerk

1324
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,559
reaction of fear

1325
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:56,318
about everything that could go wrong but

1326
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:00,639
in my estimation

1327
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:03,519
this should be the defining aspiration

1328
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:04,719
of all intelligent life on earth that

1329
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,519
that we would aspire

1330
00:46:04,719 --> 00:46:08,959
that basically every generation surveys

1331
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:09,519
the landscape of possibilities they're

1332
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:11,358
afforded

1333
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:13,440
given the technological cultural and

1334
00:46:11,358 --> 00:46:14,719
other contextual situation that they're

1335
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,280
in

1336
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:19,598
we're in this context we haven't yet

1337
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,720
identified this and said

1338
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:24,160
this is unbelievable we should carefully

1339
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:26,639
think this thing through

1340
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:28,000
not just of mitigating the things that

1341
00:46:26,639 --> 00:46:30,400
wipe us out like we have

1342
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,760
this potential and so we just haven't

1343
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,960
given voice to it

1344
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,720
even though it's within this realm of

1345
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,760
possibilities so you're excited about

1346
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,159
the possibility of

1347
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,599
super intelligence systems and what the

1348
00:46:38,159 --> 00:46:42,000
opportunities that bring i mean

1349
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,000
there's parallels to this you think

1350
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:47,358
about people before the internet

1351
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,280
as the internet was coming to life

1352
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:50,960
i mean there's kind of a fog through

1353
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:54,000
which you can't see

1354
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,318
what does the future look like

1355
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,679
like predicting collective intelligence

1356
00:46:56,318 --> 00:46:58,079
which i don't think we're understanding

1357
00:46:57,679 --> 00:46:59,919
that we're

1358
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,599
living through that now is that there's

1359
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:04,000
now we've

1360
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,519
we've in some sense stopped being

1361
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,079
individual intelligences

1362
00:47:05,519 --> 00:47:09,280
and become much more like collective

1363
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,480
intelligences

1364
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:16,319
because ideas travel much much

1365
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:19,199
faster now and they can in a viral way

1366
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:20,639
like sweep across the populations and so

1367
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,838
it's almost

1368
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:27,039
i mean it almost feels like a thought

1369
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:28,480
is had by many people now thousands or

1370
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:29,679
millions of people as opposed to an

1371
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,679
individual person

1372
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:33,039
and that's changed everything but to to

1373
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:34,799
me i don't think we're realizing how

1374
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,358
much that actually changed in people

1375
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,800
or societies but like to predict that

1376
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:41,358
before the internet

1377
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:43,119
would have been very difficult and in

1378
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:47,199
that same way we're sitting here

1379
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:49,920
with the fog before us thinking what is

1380
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,879
uh super intelligent systems how is that

1381
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,159
going to change

1382
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:55,599
the world what is uh increasing the

1383
00:47:54,159 --> 00:47:58,960
bandwidth like

1384
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,480
uh plugging our brains into this whole

1385
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,199
thing how is that going to change the

1386
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,960
world

1387
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:05,679
and it seems like it's a fog you don't

1388
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,880
know

1389
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:11,598
and it could be it could uh

1390
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:13,200
whatever comes to be could destroy the

1391
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:14,800
world that this we could be the last

1392
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:17,679
generation

1393
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:21,039
but it also could uh transform in in

1394
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:25,039
ways that creates a an incredibly

1395
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:27,279
fulfilling life experience that's

1396
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,759
unlike anything we've ever experienced

1397
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,440
it might involve dissolution of ego and

1398
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,559
consciousness and so on you're no longer

1399
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,920
one individual

1400
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,359
it might be more you know

1401
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:39,838
that might be a certain kind of death

1402
00:48:37,358 --> 00:48:42,078
and ego death but the experience might

1403
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:44,719
be really exciting and enriching

1404
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:45,760
maybe we'll live in a virtual like it's

1405
00:48:44,719 --> 00:48:48,399
like it's it's

1406
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,400
it's funny to think about a bunch of

1407
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,880
sort of hypothetical questions of

1408
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,880
would it be more

1409
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,280
fulfilling to live in a virtual world

1410
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,519
like if you were able to plug your brain

1411
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:03,440
in

1412
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:04,960
in a very dense way into a video game

1413
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,519
like which world would you want to live

1414
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,559
in in the video game

1415
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:12,318
or in the physical world for most of us

1416
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,760
we're kind of

1417
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:15,279
touring it with the idea of the video

1418
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,800
again but we still want to live in the

1419
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:18,160
physical world have friendships and

1420
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,359
relationships

1421
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:21,679
in the physical world but we don't know

1422
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,799
that

1423
00:49:21,679 --> 00:49:26,239
again it's a fog and maybe maybe in a

1424
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,039
hundred years we're all living inside a

1425
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:29,358
video game

1426
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,079
hopefully not call of duty hopefully

1427
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:33,920
more like

1428
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:36,640
like sims 5 which version is it on

1429
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,000
for you individually though does it make

1430
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:41,519
you

1431
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,519
sad that your brain ends

1432
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:47,920
that you die one day very soon

1433
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,119
that the whole thing that that uh that

1434
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,960
data source

1435
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:54,640
just goes offline sooner than you would

1436
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,559
like

1437
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:58,000
that's a complicated question i would

1438
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,240
have answered it

1439
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,280
differently in different times in my

1440
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:02,799
life i

1441
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:06,000
you know had chronic depression for 10

1442
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:09,039
years and so in that 10-year time period

1443
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
i desperately wanted lights to be off

1444
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,440
and the thing that made it even worse is

1445
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,159
i was in a religious

1446
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,240
i was born into a religion it was the

1447
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,239
only reality i ever understood and it's

1448
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,679
difficult to articulate to people

1449
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:23,118
when you're born into that kind of

1450
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:24,799
reality and it's the only reality you're

1451
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,800
exposed to

1452
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,160
you're literally blinded to the

1453
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:30,240
existence of other realities

1454
00:50:28,159 --> 00:50:31,279
because it's so much the in-group out

1455
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,399
group thing

1456
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:35,920
and so in that situation it was not only

1457
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,200
that i desperately wanted lights out

1458
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,480
forever

1459
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:40,639
it was that i couldn't have lights out

1460
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,960
forever it was there was an afterlife

1461
00:50:40,639 --> 00:50:48,239
and this afterlife had this

1462
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,800
system that would either penalize or or

1463
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:53,759
reward you for your behaviors and so

1464
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:57,760
it's almost like this

1465
00:50:53,760 --> 00:51:00,960
is indescribable hopelessness

1466
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:02,559
of not only being in hopeless despair

1467
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:05,039
of not wanting to exist but then also

1468
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,800
being forced to be to exist

1469
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:08,719
and so there was a duration of my time

1470
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:12,000
of the observation of life where i'd say

1471
00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:14,078
yes i have no remorse

1472
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,760
for lights being out and actually want

1473
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,079
it more than anything in the entire

1474
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,079
world

1475
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,800
there are other times where i'm looking

1476
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,920
out at the future and i say

1477
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,000
this is an opportunity for future

1478
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,000
evolving human conscious experience that

1479
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:32,639
is beyond

1480
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,639
my ability to understand and and i jump

1481
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:39,118
out of bed and i race to work and i

1482
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:42,400
i can't think about anything else but i

1483
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:45,039
i think the the reality for me

1484
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:46,880
is i don't know what it's like to be in

1485
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,358
your head but in my head

1486
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,720
when i wake up in the morning i don't

1487
00:51:49,358 --> 00:51:52,719
say

1488
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:54,078
good morning brian i'm so happy to see

1489
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:55,439
you like i'm sure

1490
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:57,039
you're just going to be beautiful to me

1491
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,159
today you're not going to make a huge

1492
00:51:57,039 --> 00:51:58,960
long list of everything you should be

1493
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:00,159
anxious about

1494
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,559
you're not going to repeat that list to

1495
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,558
me 400 times you're not going to have me

1496
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,920
relive all the regrets i've made in life

1497
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,559
i'm sure you're not doing any of that

1498
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,960
you're just going to

1499
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,599
just help me along all day long i mean

1500
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,318
it's a

1501
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:13,599
brutal environment in my brain and we've

1502
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:15,679
just become

1503
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,039
normalized to this environment that we

1504
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:18,239
just accept that this is what it means

1505
00:52:17,039 --> 00:52:21,679
to be human

1506
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:24,000
but if we look at it if we try to muster

1507
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:26,000
as much soberness as we can

1508
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,199
about the realities of being human it's

1509
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,039
brutal

1510
00:52:27,199 --> 00:52:33,598
if it is for me and so

1511
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:35,838
am i sad that the brain may be off one

1512
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:35,838
day

1513
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:39,358
yeah it depends on the contextual

1514
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,800
setting like how am i feeling what

1515
00:52:39,358 --> 00:52:42,318
moment are you asking me that and that's

1516
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,318
it's my mind is so fickle

1517
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,480
and this is why again i don't trust my

1518
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:48,639
conscious mind i have been

1519
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,079
given realities i was given a religious

1520
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:52,558
reality

1521
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:53,599
that was a video game and then i figured

1522
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,359
out it was not

1523
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,359
a real reality and then i lived in a

1524
00:52:55,358 --> 00:53:00,159
depressive reality which delivered

1525
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:01,920
this terrible hopelessness that wasn't a

1526
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:03,519
real reality then i discovered

1527
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,400
uh behavioral psychology and i figured

1528
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:08,000
out how biased 188 chronicle biases and

1529
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,800
how my brain is distorting reality all

1530
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,280
the time

1531
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,000
i have gone from one reality to another

1532
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,480
i don't

1533
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,760
trust reality i don't trust realities

1534
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,159
are given to me

1535
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,000
and so to make try to make a decision on

1536
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:20,480
what i value or not value that future

1537
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,519
state

1538
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:27,199
i don't trust my response so not

1539
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:29,759
fully not fully listening to

1540
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,960
the conscious mind at any one moment as

1541
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,119
the ultimate truth

1542
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,199
but allowing it to go up and down as it

1543
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,680
does and just kind of being observing it

1544
00:53:35,199 --> 00:53:38,639
yes i assume that whatever my conscious

1545
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,838
mind delivers up

1546
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:43,759
to my awareness is wrong

1547
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:45,358
on pawn landing and i just need to

1548
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,800
figure out where it's wrong how it's

1549
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:48,400
wrong how wrong it is

1550
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:50,880
and then try to correct for it as best i

1551
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:53,838
can but i i assume

1552
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,519
that on impact it's mistaken in some

1553
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:57,358
critical ways

1554
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:59,280
is there something you can say by way of

1555
00:53:57,358 --> 00:54:01,039
advice

1556
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,640
when the mind is depressive when the

1557
00:54:01,039 --> 00:54:05,920
conscious mind serves up

1558
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:09,118
something that uh you know

1559
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,720
the dark thoughts how you deal with that

1560
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:12,318
how in your own life you've overcome

1561
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:13,439
that and others who are experiencing

1562
00:54:12,318 --> 00:54:17,920
that

1563
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:21,119
can overcome it two things one

1564
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:25,599
that those depressive

1565
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:28,640
states are biochemical states

1566
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:31,440
it's not you

1567
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:33,199
and the suggestions that these things

1568
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,039
that this state delivers to you about

1569
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:35,358
suggestion of the hopelessness of lice

1570
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,358
or

1571
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:42,318
or the meaninglessness of it or

1572
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:44,239
that you should hit the eject button

1573
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:47,519
that's a false reality

1574
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:51,439
yeah and that it's when

1575
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:54,000
i i completely understand their rational

1576
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,760
decision to commit suicide there's it is

1577
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,798
not lost to me at all that that is a and

1578
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,040
that is an irrational

1579
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,318
situation but the key is when you're in

1580
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:01,599
that situation those thoughts are

1581
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:04,838
landing

1582
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:06,559
to be able to say thank you you're not

1583
00:55:04,838 --> 00:55:08,798
real

1584
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,559
i know you're not real yeah and so i'm

1585
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:11,358
in a situation where for whatever reason

1586
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,480
i'm having this

1587
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:16,880
this uh neurochemical state but

1588
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,960
that state can be altered and so it

1589
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:21,200
again it goes back to the realities of

1590
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,400
the difficulties of of being human and

1591
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:23,358
like when i was trying to solve my

1592
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,240
depression i

1593
00:55:23,358 --> 00:55:27,119
tried literally ev you name it i tried

1594
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,358
it

1595
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:30,318
systematically and nothing would fix it

1596
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:31,838
and so

1597
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:33,920
this is what gives me hope with brain

1598
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:35,279
interfaces for example like could i have

1599
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,880
numbers on my brain

1600
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,480
can i see what's going on because i go

1601
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,838
to the doctor and it's like how do you

1602
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,400
feel i don't know

1603
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,440
terrible like on a scale of 10 how bad

1604
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:47,200
you want to commit suicide

1605
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,200
10. okay at this moment here's

1606
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:51,039
here's his bottle how much i take well i

1607
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,759
don't know like just

1608
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:55,358
yeah it's very very crude and this data

1609
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,960
opens up the

1610
00:55:55,358 --> 00:56:00,159
the yeah it opens up the possibility of

1611
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,079
really helping

1612
00:56:00,159 --> 00:56:03,440
in those dark moments to first

1613
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:05,119
understand

1614
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,358
the the waves the ups and downs of those

1615
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:09,760
dark moments on the complete flip side

1616
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:09,759
of that i

1617
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:18,318
i am uh very conscious in my own brain

1618
00:56:14,798 --> 00:56:20,000
and deeply deeply grateful that

1619
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:22,960
what they're it's it's almost like a

1620
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:26,000
chemistry thing a biochemistry thing

1621
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:29,599
that i go many times throughout the day

1622
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:31,920
i'll i'll look at like this cup

1623
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:34,000
and i'll be overcome with joy how

1624
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:36,159
amazing it is to be alive

1625
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,639
like i actually think i'm my

1626
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:42,318
biochemistry is such that it's not

1627
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:44,558
as common like i've talked to people

1628
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:45,440
and i don't think that's that common

1629
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,160
like it's a

1630
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,599
and it's not a rational thing at all

1631
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:52,399
it's like

1632
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,280
i feel like i'm on drugs and i'll just

1633
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:56,798
be like

1634
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,000
whoa a lot of people talk about like the

1635
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:00,079
meditative experience

1636
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,599
will allow you to sort of you know look

1637
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:02,720
at some basic things like the movement

1638
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:05,119
of your hand

1639
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,078
as uh deeply joyful because it's like

1640
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,680
that's life

1641
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:09,599
but i get that from just looking at a

1642
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:09,919
cup like i'm waiting for the coffee to

1643
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,519
brew

1644
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:16,159
and i'll just be like

1645
00:57:13,519 --> 00:57:17,679
life is awesome and i'll sometimes tweet

1646
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:18,960
that but then i'll like regret it later

1647
00:57:17,679 --> 00:57:22,639
like god damn it you're so

1648
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:25,679
uh ridiculous but yeah so but that

1649
00:57:22,639 --> 00:57:27,440
is purely chemistry like

1650
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,039
there's no rational it doesn't fit with

1651
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,440
the rest of my life i have all this

1652
00:57:29,039 --> 00:57:32,318
i'm always late to stuff i'm always like

1653
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,639
there's all stuff

1654
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:36,239
you know i'm super self-critical like

1655
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:36,879
really self-critical about everything i

1656
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:38,719
do

1657
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,079
i'm to the point i almost hate

1658
00:57:38,719 --> 00:57:42,318
everything i do but

1659
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,440
there's this engine of joy for life

1660
00:57:42,318 --> 00:57:45,358
outside of all that

1661
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,280
and that has to be chemistry and the

1662
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:48,400
flip side of that is what depression

1663
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,160
probably is

1664
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:55,440
is the opposite of that feeling of

1665
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:58,960
like because i i bet you that feeling of

1666
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:01,119
the cup being amazing is would save

1667
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:02,720
anybody in a state of depression like

1668
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,880
that that would be like fresh

1669
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:07,279
you're in a desert and it's a drink of

1670
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,280
water

1671
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:12,159
man the brain is uh it would be

1672
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,280
nice to understand where that's coming

1673
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:17,358
from

1674
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:19,119
to to be able to um to understand the

1675
00:58:17,358 --> 00:58:20,838
how you hit those lows and those highs

1676
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:22,960
that have nothing to do with the actual

1677
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:25,599
reality it has to do with some very

1678
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,639
specific aspects

1679
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:30,400
of how you maybe see the world maybe it

1680
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:32,000
could be just like basic habits that you

1681
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,318
engage in and then how to

1682
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,318
walk along the line to to find those

1683
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:38,000
experiences of joy and this goes back to

1684
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:41,039
the discussion we're having of

1685
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:44,159
human cognition is in volume

1686
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,519
the largest input of raw material into

1687
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:48,719
society

1688
00:58:45,519 --> 00:58:50,159
yeah and it's not quantified we have no

1689
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:54,639
bearings on it

1690
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:56,000
and so we just you wonder

1691
00:58:54,639 --> 00:58:58,639
we both articulated some of the

1692
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:02,159
challenges we have in our own mind

1693
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:04,078
and it's likely that others would say

1694
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:07,440
i have something similar yeah and you

1695
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:10,400
wonder when you look at society

1696
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,960
what how does that contribute to all the

1697
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,240
other

1698
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,159
compounded problems that we're

1699
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:16,879
experiencing how does that

1700
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,480
blind us to the the opportunities we

1701
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:22,880
could be looking at

1702
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:25,440
and so it really it has this potential

1703
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,920
distortion effect on reality that just

1704
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,119
makes

1705
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:32,318
everything worse and i hope

1706
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:34,720
if we can put some if we can

1707
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:36,239
assign some numbers to these things just

1708
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:38,399
to get our bearings

1709
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:40,078
so we're aware of what's going on if we

1710
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,680
could find greater stabilization

1711
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,480
in how we conduct our lives and how we

1712
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:44,480
build society

1713
00:59:45,679 --> 00:59:50,159
it it might be the thing that enables us

1714
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,159
to scaffold

1715
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:54,159
uh because we've really again we've done

1716
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:57,279
a humans have done a fantastic job

1717
00:59:54,159 --> 01:00:00,318
systematically scaffolding

1718
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,119
technology and science institutions

1719
01:00:00,318 --> 01:00:04,798
it's humans it's our own selves which we

1720
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:05,280
have not been able to scaffold it's it's

1721
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:07,440
we are the

1722
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:08,319
we are the one part of this intelligence

1723
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:11,440
infrastructure

1724
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:11,440
that remains unchanged

1725
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:15,199
is there something you could say about

1726
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:18,479
coupling

1727
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:20,159
this brain data with uh not just the

1728
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,280
basic human experience but say

1729
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:24,798
an experience you mentioned sleep but

1730
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,480
the wildest experience which is

1731
01:00:24,798 --> 01:00:28,960
psychedelics

1732
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,519
is there and there's been quite a few

1733
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,199
studies

1734
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:35,599
now that are being um approved and run

1735
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:36,399
which is exciting from a scientific

1736
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,760
perspective

1737
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,960
on psychedelics uh do you think

1738
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:43,839
uh what do you think happens to the

1739
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:43,838
brain on psychedelics

1740
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,240
and how can data about this help us

1741
01:00:46,639 --> 01:00:50,159
understand it

1742
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:51,279
and uh when you're on dmt do you see

1743
01:00:50,159 --> 01:00:54,639
else and can we guess

1744
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:56,319
can we convert into data um can you add

1745
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:58,078
aliens in there

1746
01:00:56,318 --> 01:00:59,440
yeah aliens definitely do you actually

1747
01:00:58,079 --> 01:01:02,559
meet aliens and elves are

1748
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:05,760
elves the aliens i'm asking for uh for a

1749
01:01:02,559 --> 01:01:07,359
few austin friends yet

1750
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:08,799
that that are convinced that they've

1751
01:01:07,358 --> 01:01:10,880
actually met the elves

1752
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:12,960
what are elves like are they friendly

1753
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,559
are they healthy i haven't met them

1754
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,760
the smurfs of like they're like they're

1755
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:18,559
industrious and they have different

1756
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:20,880
skill sets and

1757
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,240
yeah i think they're very uh they're

1758
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,519
very

1759
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:26,639
critical as friends that's what they're

1760
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:30,798
trolls the elder

1761
01:01:26,639 --> 01:01:32,400
trolls no but they care about you so

1762
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:35,039
there's a bunch of different version of

1763
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:35,440
trolls there's there's a loving trolls

1764
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,239
that

1765
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,519
are harsh on you but they want you to be

1766
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:40,558
better and there's trolls that just

1767
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:43,199
enjoy

1768
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,798
the your destruction and i think they're

1769
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,439
the ones that care for you

1770
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,798
like i i think they're criticism for my

1771
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,838
see i'm i'm talking i haven't met him

1772
01:01:48,798 --> 01:01:51,838
directly so i'm i'm

1773
01:01:49,838 --> 01:01:53,279
it's like a friend of a friend yeah i'm

1774
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:55,519
getting a telephone

1775
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,280
yeah a bit of a and and the whole point

1776
01:01:55,519 --> 01:02:00,239
is that in psychedelics

1777
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:01,039
and certainly at dmt where this is where

1778
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:05,038
the

1779
01:02:01,039 --> 01:02:07,200
the the brain data versus war data

1780
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,160
fails which is you know words can't

1781
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,078
convey the experience

1782
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,759
most people that you can be poetic and

1783
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,798
so on but it really does not convey the

1784
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,799
experience of what

1785
01:02:12,798 --> 01:02:16,719
what it actually means to meet the uh to

1786
01:02:14,798 --> 01:02:19,519
meet the elves i mean to me what

1787
01:02:16,719 --> 01:02:20,078
baselines this conversation is imagine

1788
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,480
if you

1789
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:24,240
if we were interested in the health of

1790
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,679
your heart

1791
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:29,519
and we started and said okay lex

1792
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:30,879
self-introspect tell me how's the health

1793
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:33,358
of your heart you sit there and you

1794
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,960
close your eyes and you think

1795
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:36,558
it feels all right like things seem

1796
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:38,159
things feel okay

1797
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:39,599
and then you went to the cardiologist

1798
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:41,679
and the cardiologist like hey lex

1799
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,798
you know tell me how you feel actually

1800
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:45,759
what i'd really like

1801
01:02:42,798 --> 01:02:47,440
you to do is do an ekg and a blood panel

1802
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:49,760
and look at arterial plaques

1803
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,200
and let's look at my cholesterol and

1804
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,280
there's like

1805
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,358
five to ten studies you would do they

1806
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:58,160
then give you this report and say here's

1807
01:02:55,358 --> 01:02:59,679
the quantified health of your heart now

1808
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:01,679
with this data

1809
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:03,519
i'm going to prescribe the following

1810
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:04,480
regime of exercise and maybe i'll put

1811
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:07,838
you on a statin

1812
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,039
like et cetera but the protocol is based

1813
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:10,719
upon this data you would

1814
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,960
think the cardiologist is out of their

1815
01:03:10,719 --> 01:03:13,759
mind if they just gave you a bottle of

1816
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:15,119
statins

1817
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,480
based upon you're like well i think

1818
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:17,838
something's kind of wrong and they're

1819
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,159
just just kind of

1820
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:22,480
experiment and see what happens that's

1821
01:03:20,159 --> 01:03:25,038
what we do with our mental health today

1822
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:27,358
so you're it's it's kind of absurd and

1823
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:29,039
so if you look at psychedelics

1824
01:03:27,358 --> 01:03:31,440
to have again to be able to measure the

1825
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:33,359
brain and get a baseline state

1826
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,720
and then to measure during a psychedelic

1827
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:37,119
experience and post a psychedelic

1828
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:38,879
experience then do it longitudinally

1829
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,240
you now have a quantification of what's

1830
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:41,838
going on and so

1831
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:43,759
you could then pose questions what

1832
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:46,239
molecule is appropriate

1833
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,680
at what dosages at what frequency in

1834
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:49,519
what contextual environment

1835
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:51,279
what happens when i have this diet with

1836
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:52,880
this molecule with this experience

1837
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,319
all the experimentation you do when you

1838
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,680
have good sleep data or

1839
01:03:54,318 --> 01:03:59,679
hrv and so that's what i think happens

1840
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:01,440
what we could potentially do with

1841
01:03:59,679 --> 01:04:02,960
psychedelics is we could add this level

1842
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,200
of sophistication

1843
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,720
that is not in the industry currently

1844
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:08,879
and it may

1845
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:11,439
improve the outcomes people experience

1846
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:13,519
it may improve the safety and efficacy

1847
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:15,679
and so that's what i hope we are able to

1848
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:19,119
achieve and

1849
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:21,199
it would transform mental health

1850
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,880
because we would finally have numbers to

1851
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:25,598
work with to baseline ourselves and then

1852
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:27,039
if you think about it we when we talk

1853
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,119
about things related to the mind we talk

1854
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,720
about the modality we use words like

1855
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:32,798
meditation or psychedelics or

1856
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,719
or something else because we can't talk

1857
01:04:32,798 --> 01:04:35,599
about a marker in the brain we can't use

1858
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:37,118
a word to say

1859
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:38,400
we can't talk about cholesterol we don't

1860
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,200
talk about plaque in the arteries we

1861
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:42,960
don't talk about

1862
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:45,439
hrv and so if we have numbers then

1863
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:47,039
the solutions get mapped to numbers

1864
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,960
instead of the modalities being the

1865
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:52,480
thing we talk about meditation just does

1866
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:54,720
good things in a crude fashion

1867
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:56,960
so in your blog post zeroth principle

1868
01:04:54,719 --> 01:04:58,639
thinking good title you ponder how do

1869
01:04:56,960 --> 01:04:59,679
people come up with uh truly original

1870
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,159
ideas

1871
01:04:59,679 --> 01:05:02,798
uh what what's your thoughts on this as

1872
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:04,318
a human

1873
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:06,400
and as a person who's measuring brain

1874
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:09,759
data zeroth

1875
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:12,720
principles are building blocks

1876
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,400
first principles are understanding of

1877
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,159
system laws

1878
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,318
so if you take for example like in

1879
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:18,798
sherlock holmes he's a first principle

1880
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:23,119
thinker

1881
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:26,159
so he says once you've eliminated

1882
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:28,318
the impossible anything that remains

1883
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:32,639
however improbable

1884
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:34,159
is true whereas dirk gently the holistic

1885
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,118
detective by douglas adams

1886
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:38,159
says i don't like eliminating the

1887
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:40,798
impossible

1888
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:43,920
so when someone says from a first

1889
01:05:40,798 --> 01:05:46,559
principal's perspective

1890
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:48,880
and they they're trying to assume the

1891
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:53,039
fewest number of things

1892
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:56,318
within a given time frame and so when i

1893
01:05:53,039 --> 01:06:00,000
after braintree venmo

1894
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:01,920
i set my mind to the question of

1895
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,599
what single thing can i do that would

1896
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,000
maximally increase the probability that

1897
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,079
the human

1898
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,039
race thrives beyond what we can even

1899
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,000
imagine

1900
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:11,920
and i found that in my conversations

1901
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:15,358
with others in the books i read

1902
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:17,440
in my own deliberations i had a missing

1903
01:06:15,358 --> 01:06:20,558
piece of the puzzle

1904
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:23,039
because i didn't feel like uh over if

1905
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:26,000
yeah i didn't feel like the future

1906
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:27,760
could be deduced from first principle

1907
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,639
thinking

1908
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:33,039
and that's when i i read the book zero a

1909
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:34,719
biography of a dangerous idea

1910
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,240
and i i have a really good book by the

1911
01:06:34,719 --> 01:06:37,759
way it's

1912
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:39,279
i think it's my favorite book i've ever

1913
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:40,000
read it's also a really interesting

1914
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:42,880
number

1915
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:44,318
zero and i i wasn't aware that the

1916
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:45,760
number zero had to be discovered i

1917
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:48,480
didn't realize that it caused a

1918
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,400
revolution in philosophy and

1919
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,798
it just tore up math and it tore up i

1920
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,358
mean it builds modern society but it

1921
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:57,280
it wrecked everything in its way it was

1922
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:59,519
an unbelievable disrupter and it

1923
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:00,720
was so difficult for society to get

1924
01:06:59,519 --> 01:07:05,038
their heads around it

1925
01:07:00,719 --> 01:07:06,399
yeah and so zero is of course the

1926
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,480
representation of zeroth principle

1927
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:11,440
thinking which is it's

1928
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:13,519
the caliber and consequential nature of

1929
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,400
an idea

1930
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:18,719
and so when you talk about what kind of

1931
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,280
ideas

1932
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:23,279
have civilization transforming

1933
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:24,720
properties

1934
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,119
oftentimes they fall in the zeroth

1935
01:07:24,719 --> 01:07:29,679
category and so

1936
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:30,559
in thinking this through i i was wanting

1937
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:32,639
to find a

1938
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,000
quantitative structure on how to think

1939
01:07:32,639 --> 01:07:35,838
about

1940
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,119
these zeroth principles and that's so i

1941
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:40,239
came up with that

1942
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:41,760
to be a coupler with first principle

1943
01:07:40,239 --> 01:07:43,199
thinking and so now it's a staple as

1944
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:46,559
part of how i think about

1945
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:47,519
the world in the future so it emphasizes

1946
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,680
trying to identify

1947
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:51,119
the lands on that word impossible like

1948
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:53,838
what is impossible

1949
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:55,519
essentially trying to identify what is

1950
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:56,000
impossible and what is possible and

1951
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:59,599
being

1952
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,679
as how do you i mean

1953
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:03,280
this this is the thing is most of

1954
01:08:01,679 --> 01:08:04,719
society tells you

1955
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,798
the range of things they say is

1956
01:08:04,719 --> 01:08:07,919
impossible is very wide so you need to

1957
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:10,798
be shrinking that

1958
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,358
i mean that's the whole process of of

1959
01:08:10,798 --> 01:08:16,640
this kind of thinking is you need to

1960
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:20,318
be very rigorous in in

1961
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:22,079
trying to be trying to draw the lines of

1962
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:25,039
what is actually impossible

1963
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,238
because uh very few things are actually

1964
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:29,278
impossible

1965
01:08:26,238 --> 01:08:31,678
i don't know what is actually impossible

1966
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,799
like uh it's the joe rogan is entirely

1967
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:36,239
possible

1968
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:39,119
i like that approach to uh to science

1969
01:08:36,238 --> 01:08:40,479
to engineering to entrepreneurship it's

1970
01:08:39,119 --> 01:08:43,278
entirely possible

1971
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:45,198
basically shrink the impossible to zero

1972
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:48,960
to very small set

1973
01:08:45,198 --> 01:08:52,399
yeah life constraints favor

1974
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:55,679
first principle thinking because it

1975
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:57,519
it enables faster action with higher

1976
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,798
probability of success

1977
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,759
pursuing zero with principal optionality

1978
01:09:00,798 --> 01:09:04,479
is expensive

1979
01:09:01,759 --> 01:09:06,079
and uncertain and so in a society

1980
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:09,678
constrained by resources

1981
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:12,318
time and money and a desire for social

1982
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:14,480
status accomplishment etc

1983
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,679
it minimizes zero principle thinking but

1984
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:18,559
but the reason why i think

1985
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:20,399
zeroth principle thinking should be a

1986
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,679
staple of our shared

1987
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:25,358
cognitive infrastructure is if you look

1988
01:09:23,679 --> 01:09:26,560
through the history of the past couple

1989
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,838
thousand years and

1990
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:32,000
let's just say we arbitrarily

1991
01:09:29,838 --> 01:09:34,559
we subjectively try to assess what is a

1992
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,719
zero level zero level idea

1993
01:09:34,560 --> 01:09:37,759
and we say how many have occurred on

1994
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:38,960
what time scales

1995
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:40,798
and what were the contextual settings

1996
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:44,640
for it i would argue

1997
01:09:40,798 --> 01:09:48,640
that if you look at alphago

1998
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:51,920
when it played go from another dimension

1999
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,359
with the the human go players when it

2000
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,199
saw alphago's moves

2001
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:56,800
it attributed it to like playing with an

2002
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:58,719
alien playing

2003
01:09:56,800 --> 01:10:00,079
go with uh with alcohol being from

2004
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:02,719
another dimension

2005
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:04,399
and so if you say computational

2006
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:07,039
intelligence

2007
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:08,559
has an attribute of introducing

2008
01:10:07,039 --> 01:10:11,840
zero-like

2009
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:14,800
insights then if you say

2010
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,079
what is going to be the occurrence of

2011
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:18,640
zeros in society

2012
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:19,519
going forward and you could reasonably

2013
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,360
say

2014
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:24,000
probably a lot more than have occurred

2015
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:26,000
and probably more at a faster pace

2016
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:28,079
so then if you say what happens if you

2017
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:30,319
have this computational intelligence

2018
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:31,600
throughout society the manufacturing

2019
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:33,679
design and distribution of intelligence

2020
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:35,520
is now going to heading towards zero

2021
01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:37,119
you have an increased number of zeros

2022
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,600
being produced

2023
01:10:37,119 --> 01:10:41,279
with a tight connection between humans

2024
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:43,600
computers

2025
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:45,519
that's when i got to a point and said we

2026
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:48,640
cannot predict the future

2027
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:50,560
with first principles thinking we can't

2028
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:52,239
that cannot be our imagination set it

2029
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:55,280
can't be

2030
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:56,559
uh our sole anchor in this situation

2031
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:59,198
that basically the future of our

2032
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:02,880
conscious existence 20 30 40 50 years

2033
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:06,479
is probably a zero

2034
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:09,520
so just to clarify when you say

2035
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:12,639
zero you're referring to basically

2036
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:15,199
a truly revolutionary idea yeah

2037
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:16,960
something that is currently not a

2038
01:11:15,198 --> 01:11:20,000
building block

2039
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:21,760
of our

2040
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,760
shared conscious existence either in the

2041
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,560
form of knowledge

2042
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:27,840
uh yeah it's currently not manifest yeah

2043
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:30,719
in what we

2044
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,279
acknowledge so zeroth principle thinking

2045
01:11:30,719 --> 01:11:34,480
is

2046
01:11:31,279 --> 01:11:38,238
playing with ideas that are so

2047
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:40,319
revolutionary that we can't even

2048
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:41,839
clearly reason about the consequences

2049
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:45,679
once those ideas come to be

2050
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:45,679
yeah or for example like einstein

2051
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:50,560
that was a zeroth i would categorize it

2052
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:52,880
as a zeroth principle

2053
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:55,120
insight you mean generality space time

2054
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:58,719
yeah

2055
01:11:55,119 --> 01:12:00,399
basically building upon what newton had

2056
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:04,399
done and said

2057
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:06,639
yes also and it just changed the

2058
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:08,000
fabric of our understanding of reality

2059
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:11,360
and so that was unexpected

2060
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:13,520
it existed we just uh it became

2061
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:15,279
it came part of our awareness and the

2062
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:18,960
moves alpha go made

2063
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:22,000
existed it just came into our awareness

2064
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:25,439
and so it to your point

2065
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:28,319
there's this question of

2066
01:12:25,439 --> 01:12:29,839
what do we know and what don't we know

2067
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:31,759
do we think we know 99

2068
01:12:29,840 --> 01:12:32,880
of all things or do we think we know

2069
01:12:31,760 --> 01:12:35,360
0.001

2070
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,279
of all things and that goes back to no

2071
01:12:35,359 --> 01:12:38,799
no no knowns and unknown unknowns

2072
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:40,960
and first principles and zero principle

2073
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,560
thinking gives us a quantitative

2074
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:45,119
framework to say

2075
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:46,480
there's no way for us to mathematically

2076
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:47,599
try to create probabilities for these

2077
01:12:46,479 --> 01:12:50,799
things

2078
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:52,159
therefore it would be helpful if they

2079
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,360
were just part of our standard thought

2080
01:12:52,158 --> 01:12:56,879
processes

2081
01:12:53,359 --> 01:13:00,079
because it may encourage different

2082
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,840
behaviors in what we do individually

2083
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:03,359
collectively as a society what we aspire

2084
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:05,840
to what we talk about

2085
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:06,639
the possibility sets we imagine yeah

2086
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,039
i've been

2087
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:11,119
engaged in that kind of thinking uh

2088
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:12,960
quite a bit

2089
01:13:11,119 --> 01:13:14,399
and thinking about engineering of

2090
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:16,640
consciousness

2091
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:18,158
i think it's feasible i think it's

2092
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,199
possible in the language that we're

2093
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:21,039
using here

2094
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:22,719
it's very difficult to reason about a

2095
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:26,000
world

2096
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:26,800
when inklings of consciousness can be

2097
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:31,039
engineered

2098
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:33,520
into uh artificial systems

2099
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:35,519
not from a philosophical perspective but

2100
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,520
from an engineering perspective

2101
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,679
i believe a good step towards

2102
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,880
engineering consciousness

2103
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:47,359
is is creating engineering the

2104
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:51,840
illusion of consciousness i'm

2105
01:13:47,359 --> 01:13:55,119
captivated by our natural predisposition

2106
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:58,159
to anthropomorphize things

2107
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:58,158
and i think that's what we

2108
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:02,159
i don't want to hear from the

2109
01:13:59,920 --> 01:14:03,920
philosophers but

2110
01:14:02,158 --> 01:14:05,519
i think that's what we kind of do to

2111
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,640
each other okay

2112
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:12,159
that consciousness is

2113
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:14,640
created socially

2114
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:16,000
that like much of the power of

2115
01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:19,039
consciousness

2116
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:22,079
is in the social interaction i create

2117
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:24,000
your consciousness no i create my

2118
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:25,279
consciousness by having interaction with

2119
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,039
you

2120
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:28,800
and that that's the display of

2121
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:29,920
consciousness it's the same as like the

2122
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,960
display of emotion

2123
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:36,000
emotion is created through communication

2124
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:37,920
language is created through its use

2125
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,439
and then we somehow humans kind of

2126
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:40,800
especially philosophers you know the

2127
01:14:39,439 --> 01:14:43,359
heart problem of consciousness

2128
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:44,400
really want to believe that we possess

2129
01:14:43,359 --> 01:14:46,799
this thing

2130
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:47,759
that's like there's a there's a bot

2131
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:50,239
there's a there's an

2132
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:51,119
elf sitting there with the with the hat

2133
01:14:50,238 --> 01:14:53,039
that's or like

2134
01:14:51,119 --> 01:14:54,559
name tag says consciousness and they're

2135
01:14:53,039 --> 01:14:57,679
like feeding

2136
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,719
this subjective experience to us as

2137
01:14:57,679 --> 01:15:02,158
opposed to

2138
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:03,439
like it actually being an illusion that

2139
01:15:02,158 --> 01:15:05,359
would construct to make social

2140
01:15:03,439 --> 01:15:08,479
communication more effective

2141
01:15:05,359 --> 01:15:10,479
and so i think if you focus on

2142
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:12,000
creating the illusion of consciousness

2143
01:15:10,479 --> 01:15:13,279
you can create some very fulfilling

2144
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,840
experiences

2145
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:16,800
in in software and so that to me is the

2146
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,119
compelling

2147
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:20,239
space of ideas to explore i agree with

2148
01:15:19,119 --> 01:15:21,599
you and i think

2149
01:15:20,238 --> 01:15:23,439
going back to our experience together

2150
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,000
with brain interfaces on you could

2151
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:25,919
imagine

2152
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:27,679
if we get to a certain level of maturity

2153
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:29,600
so first let's take

2154
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:31,279
the the inverse of this so you and i

2155
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:33,120
text back and forth and we're sending

2156
01:15:31,279 --> 01:15:36,479
each other emojis

2157
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,840
that has a certain amount of information

2158
01:15:36,479 --> 01:15:39,198
transfer rate as we're communicating

2159
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:41,199
with each other

2160
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:43,198
and so in our communication with people

2161
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:46,719
via email and text and whatnot we've

2162
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:48,158
taken the bandwidth of human interaction

2163
01:15:46,719 --> 01:15:49,840
the information transfer rate and we've

2164
01:15:48,158 --> 01:15:52,000
reduced it

2165
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,520
we have less social cues we have less

2166
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,198
information to work with there's a lot

2167
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:57,040
more opportunity for misunderstanding

2168
01:15:55,198 --> 01:15:59,359
so that is altering the conscious

2169
01:15:57,039 --> 01:16:01,039
experience between two individuals

2170
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:03,279
and if we add brain interfaces to the

2171
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:05,439
equation let's imagine now we amplify

2172
01:16:03,279 --> 01:16:07,119
the dimensionality of our communications

2173
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:09,039
that to me is what you're talking about

2174
01:16:07,119 --> 01:16:13,279
which is consciousness engineering

2175
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:15,279
perhaps i understand you with dimensions

2176
01:16:13,279 --> 01:16:16,319
so maybe i understand your hap when you

2177
01:16:15,279 --> 01:16:17,679
look at the cup

2178
01:16:16,319 --> 01:16:19,519
and you experience that happiness you

2179
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,480
can tell me you're happy and i then do

2180
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:22,640
theory of mine and say

2181
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:24,319
i can imagine what it might be like to

2182
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,119
be lex and feel happy about seeing this

2183
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:26,639
cup

2184
01:16:25,119 --> 01:16:29,279
but if the interface could then quantify

2185
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:30,000
and give me a 50 vector space model and

2186
01:16:29,279 --> 01:16:31,599
say

2187
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:33,119
this is the version of happiness that

2188
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,239
lex is experiencing as he looks at this

2189
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:36,479
cup

2190
01:16:34,238 --> 01:16:38,000
then it would allow me potentially to

2191
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,678
have much greater empathy for you and

2192
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,800
understand you as a human of this is how

2193
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,039
you experience

2194
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:44,560
joy yes which is entirely unique from

2195
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:45,920
how i experience joy even though we

2196
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,600
assumed ahead of time

2197
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:49,679
that we were having some kind of similar

2198
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,520
experience but i agree with you that

2199
01:16:49,679 --> 01:16:53,119
the we do consciousness engineering

2200
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:54,320
today in everything we do when we talk

2201
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:55,679
to each other when we're building

2202
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:58,880
products

2203
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:01,359
and that we're entering into it in

2204
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:03,119
a stage where it will be much more

2205
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:06,158
methodical

2206
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:07,679
and quantitative based and computational

2207
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:10,000
in how we go about doing it which to me

2208
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:14,239
i find encouraging because

2209
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:17,279
i think it creates better guardrails for

2210
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:19,678
to create uh ethical systems

2211
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:21,119
on versus right now i feel like it's

2212
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:23,279
really wild wild west

2213
01:17:21,119 --> 01:17:25,039
on how these interactions are happening

2214
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:26,000
yeah and it's funny you focus on human

2215
01:17:25,039 --> 01:17:28,158
to human but that

2216
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:29,119
this kind of data enables human to

2217
01:17:28,158 --> 01:17:32,639
machine yes

2218
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:33,840
interaction which is what we're

2219
01:17:32,640 --> 01:17:36,400
kind of talking about when we say

2220
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:39,199
engineering consciousness

2221
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:40,479
and that will happen of course let's

2222
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:42,799
flip that on its head let's

2223
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:43,519
right now we're putting humans as the

2224
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,360
central

2225
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:48,800
node what if we gave gpt3

2226
01:17:47,359 --> 01:17:50,399
a bunch of human brains and said hey

2227
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:54,000
gpt3

2228
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:56,399
learn some manners when you speak yeah

2229
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,399
and run your algorithms on humans brains

2230
01:17:56,399 --> 01:18:00,799
and see how they respond

2231
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:01,599
so you can be polite and so that you can

2232
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,440
be friendly

2233
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:06,079
and so that you can be conversationally

2234
01:18:03,439 --> 01:18:07,519
appropriate but to inverse it to give

2235
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:10,319
our machines

2236
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:11,679
a training set in real time with closed

2237
01:18:10,319 --> 01:18:13,759
loop feedback

2238
01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:16,880
so that our machines were better

2239
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:16,880
equipped to

2240
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:22,239
find their way through our society in

2241
01:18:20,079 --> 01:18:24,960
polite and kind and appropriate ways

2242
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:26,879
i love the idea or better yet teach it

2243
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,279
some uh

2244
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:30,239
uh have it uh read the founding

2245
01:18:29,279 --> 01:18:32,479
documents and

2246
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:34,639
have a visit austin in texas and so that

2247
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:37,279
when you ask when you tell it

2248
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:38,840
why don't you learn some manners it gpt3

2249
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:43,519
learns to say

2250
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:46,719
no it learns what it means to be free

2251
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:48,239
and a sovereign individual so that

2252
01:18:46,719 --> 01:18:50,079
it depends so it depends what kind of

2253
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:52,158
version of gpg3 you want

2254
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:54,640
one that's free one that behaves well

2255
01:18:52,158 --> 01:18:56,158
with the social revolution

2256
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,560
you want you want to like you want a

2257
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:00,079
socialist gpt3 you want an anarchist

2258
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:03,199
gpc3

2259
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:06,000
you want to polite like you take it home

2260
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:08,238
to visit mom and dad gpt-3 and you want

2261
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,479
like party and like vegas

2262
01:19:08,238 --> 01:19:12,479
to a strip club gpt3 you want all

2263
01:19:10,479 --> 01:19:14,959
flavors and then you've got to have

2264
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:17,039
goal alignment between all those yeah

2265
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:20,560
you know they don't want to

2266
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:20,560
manipulate each other for sure

2267
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:24,239
so that that's i mean you kind of spoke

2268
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:27,439
to ethics

2269
01:19:24,238 --> 01:19:29,599
the one of the concerns that people have

2270
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:31,839
in this modern world the digital data is

2271
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:34,239
that of privacy and security

2272
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:35,119
but privacy you know they're concerned

2273
01:19:34,238 --> 01:19:38,879
that when they share

2274
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:39,279
data it's the same thing we feel when we

2275
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:42,640
are

2276
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:44,399
trust other human beings uh in being

2277
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,159
fragile and revealing something that

2278
01:19:44,399 --> 01:19:49,198
we're vulnerable

2279
01:19:46,158 --> 01:19:52,000
vulnerable about there's a there's a

2280
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:54,158
leap of faith there's a leap of trust

2281
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
that that's going to be just between us

2282
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:57,439
as a privacy to it and then

2283
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,079
the challenge is when you're in the

2284
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,960
digital space then sharing your data

2285
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:05,039
with companies that use that data for

2286
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:07,920
advertisement all those kinds of things

2287
01:20:05,039 --> 01:20:08,399
there's a hesitancy to share that much

2288
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,880
data

2289
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:12,719
to share a lot of deep personal data and

2290
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:16,079
if you look at brain data

2291
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:18,239
that feels a whole lot like it's richly

2292
01:20:16,079 --> 01:20:20,000
deeply personal data so how do you think

2293
01:20:18,238 --> 01:20:22,399
about privacy

2294
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,119
with this kind of ocean of data i think

2295
01:20:22,399 --> 01:20:26,559
we got off

2296
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:29,599
to a wrong start with the internet where

2297
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:33,840
the basic rules of play

2298
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:36,159
for the for the company that be was

2299
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:39,119
if you're a company you can go out and

2300
01:20:36,158 --> 01:20:42,158
get as much information on a person

2301
01:20:39,119 --> 01:20:44,880
as you can find without their

2302
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:46,238
approval and you can also do things to

2303
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,719
induce them

2304
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:49,599
to give you as much information and you

2305
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:50,880
don't need to tell them what you're

2306
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,320
doing with it

2307
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:54,079
you can do anything on the back side you

2308
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:55,840
can make money on it but

2309
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:57,840
the game is who can acquire the most

2310
01:20:55,840 --> 01:20:58,880
information and devise the most clever

2311
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,719
schemes

2312
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:05,840
to do it that was a bad starting place

2313
01:21:02,719 --> 01:21:07,119
and so we are in this period where we

2314
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,440
need to wreck we need to correct for

2315
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:09,840
that

2316
01:21:07,439 --> 01:21:11,039
and we need to say first of all the

2317
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:14,800
individual

2318
01:21:11,039 --> 01:21:16,319
always has control over their data

2319
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:17,920
it's not a free-for-all it's not like a

2320
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:19,439
game of hungry hippo but

2321
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:21,520
they can just go out and grab as much as

2322
01:21:19,439 --> 01:21:22,879
they want so for example when your brain

2323
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,040
data was recorded today the first thing

2324
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:28,000
we did in the kernel app was

2325
01:21:25,039 --> 01:21:29,279
you have control over your data and so

2326
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:31,520
it's individual

2327
01:21:29,279 --> 01:21:33,198
consent it's individual control and then

2328
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:35,679
you can build up on top of that

2329
01:21:33,198 --> 01:21:36,879
but it has to be based upon some clear

2330
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:39,119
rules of play if

2331
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,560
everyone knows what's being collected

2332
01:21:39,119 --> 01:21:42,238
they know what's being done with it

2333
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:44,080
and the person has control over it so

2334
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:46,079
transparency and control so

2335
01:21:44,079 --> 01:21:48,479
everybody knows what does control look

2336
01:21:46,079 --> 01:21:50,000
like me my ability to delete the data if

2337
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:51,599
i want yeah delete it and to know

2338
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:52,719
who is being shared with under what you

2339
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,560
know what under what terms and

2340
01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,760
conditions we haven't reached that level

2341
01:21:54,560 --> 01:22:02,159
of sophistication with our products of

2342
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:04,320
if if you say for example hey spotify

2343
01:22:02,158 --> 01:22:05,359
please give me a customized playlist

2344
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,319
according to

2345
01:22:05,359 --> 01:22:10,639
my neurom you know you could say you can

2346
01:22:08,319 --> 01:22:12,799
have access to this vector space model

2347
01:22:10,639 --> 01:22:14,159
but only for this duration of time and

2348
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,920
uh and then you've got to

2349
01:22:14,158 --> 01:22:17,439
delete it we haven't gotten there to

2350
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,440
that level of physician but these are

2351
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:20,559
ideas we need to start talking about of

2352
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:22,158
how do you how would you actually

2353
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:25,039
structure permissions

2354
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:27,198
yeah and i think it creates a much more

2355
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:29,840
stable set

2356
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:31,039
for society to build where we understand

2357
01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:32,960
the rules of play

2358
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:34,639
and people aren't vulnerable to being

2359
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:37,760
taken event

2360
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:40,560
it's not fair for an individual

2361
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:42,320
to be taken advantage of without their

2362
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:43,600
awareness with some other practice that

2363
01:22:42,319 --> 01:22:44,479
some companies doing for their sole

2364
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:46,079
benefit

2365
01:22:44,479 --> 01:22:47,519
and so hopefully we are going through a

2366
01:22:46,079 --> 01:22:50,719
process now where we're correcting for

2367
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:50,719
these things and that

2368
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:57,920
it can be an economy-wide shift that

2369
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,920
because really these are

2370
01:22:58,319 --> 01:23:02,319
these are fundamentals we need to have

2371
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,920
in place it's kind of fun to think about

2372
01:23:02,319 --> 01:23:06,479
like uh

2373
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:08,000
in chrome when you install an extension

2374
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:09,279
or like install an app it's

2375
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,279
asking you like what permissions you're

2376
01:23:09,279 --> 01:23:12,800
willing to give and be cool if in the

2377
01:23:11,279 --> 01:23:16,800
future it says like

2378
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:19,520
uh you can have access to my brain data

2379
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,520
i mean and if it's it's not unimaginable

2380
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:23,440
in the future

2381
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:25,679
the big technology companies have built

2382
01:23:23,439 --> 01:23:27,039
a business based upon acquiring data

2383
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:28,158
about you that they can then create you

2384
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:29,359
a model of you and sell that

2385
01:23:28,158 --> 01:23:30,879
predictability

2386
01:23:29,359 --> 01:23:32,839
and so it's not unimaginable that you

2387
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:34,159
will create with like kernel device for

2388
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:36,319
example a

2389
01:23:34,158 --> 01:23:38,238
more reliable predictor of you than they

2390
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:39,039
could and that they're asking you for

2391
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:40,559
permission

2392
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:42,000
to complete their objectives and you're

2393
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,480
the one that gets to negotiate that with

2394
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,119
them

2395
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,479
and say sure but it's not un

2396
01:23:45,119 --> 01:23:50,479
unimaginable that might

2397
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:51,599
be the case so there's a guy named elon

2398
01:23:50,479 --> 01:23:53,279
musk

2399
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:55,280
and he has a company in one of the many

2400
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:58,000
companies called neuralink

2401
01:23:55,279 --> 01:23:58,960
that has uh that's also excited about

2402
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:00,880
the brain

2403
01:23:58,960 --> 01:24:02,639
so be interesting to hear your kind of

2404
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:03,679
opinions about a very different approach

2405
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:06,800
that's invasive

2406
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:08,880
that requires surgery that implants

2407
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,079
a data collection device in the brain

2408
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,679
how do you think about the difference

2409
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:14,719
between kernel and neurolink

2410
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:17,520
in the approaches of

2411
01:24:14,719 --> 01:24:18,639
getting that stream of brain data yeah

2412
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,880
elon and i

2413
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:23,039
spoke about this a lot early on we we

2414
01:24:20,880 --> 01:24:24,960
met up i had started colonel

2415
01:24:23,039 --> 01:24:27,439
and he had an interest in printer faces

2416
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,639
as well and we explored

2417
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:30,319
doing something together him joining

2418
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,119
kernel and ultimately it wasn't the

2419
01:24:30,319 --> 01:24:33,599
right

2420
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:35,198
move and so he started neural link and i

2421
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:38,079
continued building colonel

2422
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:39,039
but it was interesting because we were

2423
01:24:38,079 --> 01:24:44,559
both

2424
01:24:39,039 --> 01:24:46,960
at this very early time where it wasn't

2425
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,960
certain what if there was a path to

2426
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:50,239
pursue

2427
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:52,239
if now was the right time to do

2428
01:24:50,238 --> 01:24:53,919
something and then the technological

2429
01:24:52,238 --> 01:24:56,000
choice of doing that and so

2430
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:58,158
we were both our starting point was

2431
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,158
looking at invasive technologies

2432
01:24:58,158 --> 01:25:01,279
and i was building invasive technology

2433
01:25:00,158 --> 01:25:04,879
at the time

2434
01:25:01,279 --> 01:25:07,599
that's ultimately where he's gone a

2435
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:10,079
little less than a year after

2436
01:25:07,600 --> 01:25:12,400
elon and i were engaged i shifted kernel

2437
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:14,800
to do non-invasive

2438
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,079
and we had this neuroscientist come to

2439
01:25:14,800 --> 01:25:17,679
colonel we were talking about he had

2440
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:19,198
been doing neurosurgery for 30 years one

2441
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,079
of the most respected neuroscientists in

2442
01:25:19,198 --> 01:25:21,359
the us

2443
01:25:20,079 --> 01:25:23,439
and we brought him to colonel to figure

2444
01:25:21,359 --> 01:25:25,359
out the ins and outs of his profession

2445
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:27,119
and at the very end of our three hour

2446
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:30,158
conversation he said

2447
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:32,880
you know every 15 or so years

2448
01:25:30,158 --> 01:25:34,638
a new technology comes along that

2449
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:37,359
changes everything

2450
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:39,520
he said it's probably already here you

2451
01:25:37,359 --> 01:25:42,399
just can't see it yet

2452
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:44,480
and my jaw dropped i thought because i i

2453
01:25:42,399 --> 01:25:47,679
had spoken to bob greenberg

2454
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:48,959
who had built a second site first on the

2455
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:52,560
optical nerve and then he did court

2456
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:55,439
up an array on the optical

2457
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,239
cortex and then i also became friendly

2458
01:25:55,439 --> 01:25:58,079
with um

2459
01:25:56,238 --> 01:25:59,678
neural pace who did who does the

2460
01:25:58,079 --> 01:26:03,760
implants for seizure detection

2461
01:25:59,679 --> 01:26:03,760
and remediation and

2462
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:09,119
i saw in our in their eyes what it was

2463
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:10,319
like to take something through an

2464
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:12,000
implantable device through

2465
01:26:10,319 --> 01:26:13,599
for for a 15-year run they initially

2466
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:15,198
thought of seven years

2467
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:16,719
and ended up being 15 years and they

2468
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:17,198
thought it'd be 100 million is you know

2469
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:20,800
300

2470
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:23,599
400 million and i really didn't want to

2471
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:24,800
build invasive technology

2472
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,360
it was the only thing that appeared to

2473
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:28,880
be possible but then once

2474
01:26:27,359 --> 01:26:30,799
i spun up an internal effort to start

2475
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,159
looking at non-invasive options we said

2476
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:33,840
is there something here is there

2477
01:26:32,158 --> 01:26:35,599
anything here that again has the

2478
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,760
characteristics of

2479
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:39,520
it has the high quality data it could be

2480
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:42,079
low-cost it could be accessible could it

2481
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:44,000
make brain interfaces mainstream

2482
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:46,158
and so i did a bet the company move we

2483
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:48,000
shifted from non-invasive to

2484
01:26:46,158 --> 01:26:50,158
invasive to non-invasive so the answer

2485
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:52,639
is yes to that there's something there

2486
01:26:50,158 --> 01:26:55,039
it's possible uh the answer is we'll see

2487
01:26:52,639 --> 01:26:56,960
we've now built both technologies

2488
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:58,079
and they're now you experience one of

2489
01:26:56,960 --> 01:27:01,359
them today

2490
01:26:58,079 --> 01:27:02,880
we were applying

2491
01:27:01,359 --> 01:27:04,559
we're now deploying it so we're trying

2492
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:06,560
to figure out what value is really there

2493
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,679
but i'd say it's really too early to

2494
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:09,920
express confidence

2495
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:11,520
whether it's to i think it's too early

2496
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:15,520
to

2497
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:19,040
assess which technological choice

2498
01:27:15,520 --> 01:27:20,400
is the right one on what time skills

2499
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:21,760
yeah time skills are really important

2500
01:27:20,399 --> 01:27:24,158
here very important because if you look

2501
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:26,560
at the like on the invasive side

2502
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:28,960
there's so much activity going on right

2503
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:32,880
now of

2504
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:35,359
less invasive techniques to get at

2505
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,800
the neuron firings which would what

2506
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:39,839
neural link is building

2507
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:41,119
it's possible that in 10 15 years when

2508
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,319
they're scaling that technology other

2509
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:44,559
things have come along

2510
01:27:42,319 --> 01:27:46,479
and you'd much rather do that that thing

2511
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:47,760
starts to clock again

2512
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:49,279
it may not be the case it may be the

2513
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:50,719
case that neural link has properly

2514
01:27:49,279 --> 01:27:52,559
chosen the right technology

2515
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:54,319
and that that's exactly what they want

2516
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,679
to be totally possible and it's also

2517
01:27:54,319 --> 01:27:56,960
possible that the paths we've chosen are

2518
01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:58,639
non-invasive

2519
01:27:56,960 --> 01:28:00,480
fall short for a variety of reasons it's

2520
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:02,639
just it's unknown

2521
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,319
and so right now the two technologies we

2522
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:06,319
chose the analogy i'd give to

2523
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:08,079
give you to create a baseline of

2524
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:09,759
understanding is

2525
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:11,279
if you think of it like the internet in

2526
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:13,440
the 90s

2527
01:28:11,279 --> 01:28:15,599
the internet became useful when people

2528
01:28:13,439 --> 01:28:18,238
could do a dial-up connection

2529
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:19,280
and then the page and then as as

2530
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:20,959
bandwidth increased

2531
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:22,800
so did the utility of that connection

2532
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:26,158
and so the ecosystem improve

2533
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:28,880
and so if you say what kernel flow uh

2534
01:28:26,158 --> 01:28:29,439
is going to give you a full screen on

2535
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,600
the picture

2536
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:33,279
of information but as you're going to be

2537
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:34,480
watching a movie but the image is going

2538
01:28:33,279 --> 01:28:37,599
to be blurred

2539
01:28:34,479 --> 01:28:40,638
and the audio is going to be muffled so

2540
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:43,679
it has a lower resolution of coverage

2541
01:28:40,639 --> 01:28:44,960
kernel flux our amyg technology is going

2542
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:48,158
to give you the full movie

2543
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:51,520
in 1080p okay and

2544
01:28:48,158 --> 01:28:55,198
neuralink is going to give you a circle

2545
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:57,679
on the screen of 4k okay

2546
01:28:55,198 --> 01:28:58,479
and so each one has their pros and cons

2547
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:01,279
and

2548
01:28:58,479 --> 01:29:02,559
uh it's give and take and so the

2549
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:04,158
decision i made

2550
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:06,239
like kernel was that these two

2551
01:29:04,158 --> 01:29:09,119
technologies flux and flow

2552
01:29:06,238 --> 01:29:10,000
were basically the answer for the next

2553
01:29:09,119 --> 01:29:12,000
seven years

2554
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,520
yeah and they would give rise to the

2555
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:15,198
ecosystem which would become much more

2556
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,239
valuable than the hardware itself

2557
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:18,399
and that we would just continue to

2558
01:29:16,238 --> 01:29:20,879
improve on the hardware over time

2559
01:29:18,399 --> 01:29:23,439
and you know it's early days so it's

2560
01:29:20,880 --> 01:29:26,000
kind of fascinating to think about that

2561
01:29:23,439 --> 01:29:26,719
you don't it's very true that you don't

2562
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,760
know

2563
01:29:26,719 --> 01:29:32,560
uh both paths are very prom

2564
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,560
are promising

2565
01:29:32,960 --> 01:29:38,399
and it's like 50 years from now

2566
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:40,718
we will look back and maybe not even

2567
01:29:38,399 --> 01:29:42,960
remember one of them

2568
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:45,039
and the other one might change the world

2569
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,359
it's so cool how technology is i mean

2570
01:29:45,039 --> 01:29:48,000
that's

2571
01:29:45,359 --> 01:29:48,799
that's what entrepreneurship is is like

2572
01:29:48,000 --> 01:29:50,479
mark it's the

2573
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,480
the zeroth principle is like you're

2574
01:29:50,479 --> 01:29:53,599
marching ahead into the darkness into

2575
01:29:52,479 --> 01:29:55,519
the fog

2576
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:57,120
not knowing it's wonderful to have

2577
01:29:55,520 --> 01:29:59,360
someone else out there with us

2578
01:29:57,119 --> 01:30:01,519
doing this because if you if you look at

2579
01:29:59,359 --> 01:30:05,279
brainerd faces

2580
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:08,719
anything that's off the shelf right now

2581
01:30:05,279 --> 01:30:10,639
is inadequate it's had its run for

2582
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:11,840
a couple decades it's still in hacker

2583
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:14,319
communities it hasn't gone to the

2584
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:14,319
mainstream

2585
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,960
the room size machines are on their own

2586
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:20,559
path

2587
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:22,079
but there is no answer right now of

2588
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:25,840
bringing brain interfaces

2589
01:30:22,079 --> 01:30:27,439
mainstream and so it both

2590
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:29,520
you know both they and us we've both

2591
01:30:27,439 --> 01:30:31,839
spent over 100 million dollars

2592
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:32,639
and that's kind of what it takes to have

2593
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:34,800
a go at this

2594
01:30:32,639 --> 01:30:35,840
because you need to build full stack i

2595
01:30:34,800 --> 01:30:38,480
mean that kernel

2596
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:39,920
we are from the photon and the atom

2597
01:30:38,479 --> 01:30:41,759
through the machine learning

2598
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:45,039
we have just under 100 people i think

2599
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:47,520
it's something like 36 37 phds

2600
01:30:45,039 --> 01:30:48,560
in these specialties these areas that

2601
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,159
there's only a few people in the world

2602
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:52,239
who have these abilities

2603
01:30:50,158 --> 01:30:54,000
and that's what it takes to build next

2604
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:56,879
generation have to

2605
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:58,399
make an attempt at breaking into brain

2606
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:59,920
interfaces and so we'll see over the

2607
01:30:58,399 --> 01:31:01,599
couple years whether it's the right time

2608
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:03,520
or whether we're both too early

2609
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:05,440
or whether something else comes along in

2610
01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,159
seven to ten years which is the right

2611
01:31:05,439 --> 01:31:10,960
thing that brings it mainstream so you

2612
01:31:08,158 --> 01:31:14,719
see elon is the kind of competitor

2613
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:16,800
or a fellow traveler

2614
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:18,960
along the path of uncertainty or both

2615
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,560
it's a fellow traveler

2616
01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,960
it's like at the beginning of the

2617
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:24,960
internet is

2618
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,000
how many companies are going to be

2619
01:31:24,960 --> 01:31:29,279
invited to

2620
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:30,880
this new ecosystem

2621
01:31:29,279 --> 01:31:33,359
like an endless number because if you

2622
01:31:30,880 --> 01:31:36,560
think that the hardware

2623
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:38,079
just starts the process and so if you

2624
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:39,760
okay back to your initial example if you

2625
01:31:38,079 --> 01:31:40,800
take the fitbit for example you say okay

2626
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:43,760
now i can get

2627
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:45,199
measurements on the body and what do we

2628
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,400
think the ultimate value of this device

2629
01:31:45,198 --> 01:31:47,678
is going to be what is the information

2630
01:31:46,399 --> 01:31:49,198
transfer rate

2631
01:31:47,679 --> 01:31:50,399
and they were in the market for a

2632
01:31:49,198 --> 01:31:51,519
certain duration of time and google

2633
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:54,000
bought them for

2634
01:31:51,520 --> 01:31:55,600
two and a half billion dollars they

2635
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:57,439
didn't have ancillary value add there

2636
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:59,679
weren't people building on top of

2637
01:31:57,439 --> 01:32:00,719
the fitbit device they also didn't have

2638
01:31:59,679 --> 01:32:02,480
increased

2639
01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:04,158
insight with additional data streams so

2640
01:32:02,479 --> 01:32:06,158
it's really just the device

2641
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:08,000
if you look for example at apple and the

2642
01:32:06,158 --> 01:32:10,079
device they sell you have value in the

2643
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:11,439
device that someone buys but also

2644
01:32:10,079 --> 01:32:13,039
you have everyone who's building on top

2645
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:14,238
of it you have this additional ecosystem

2646
01:32:13,039 --> 01:32:15,519
value and then you have

2647
01:32:14,238 --> 01:32:17,359
additional data streams that come in

2648
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:19,760
which increase the value of the product

2649
01:32:17,359 --> 01:32:20,559
and so if you say if you look at the the

2650
01:32:19,760 --> 01:32:24,079
hardware

2651
01:32:20,560 --> 01:32:26,320
as the instigator of value creation

2652
01:32:24,079 --> 01:32:28,158
you know over time it what we've built

2653
01:32:26,319 --> 01:32:29,759
may constitute five or ten percent of

2654
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:30,319
the value of the overall ecosystem and

2655
01:32:29,760 --> 01:32:31,440
that's what we

2656
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:35,840
really care about what we're trying to

2657
01:32:31,439 --> 01:32:38,960
do is kick-start the mainstream adoption

2658
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:39,600
of quantifying the brain and the

2659
01:32:38,960 --> 01:32:42,399
hardware

2660
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:44,880
just opens the door to say what kind of

2661
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:47,119
ecosystem could exist

2662
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:48,560
and that's why we the examples are so

2663
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:50,079
relevant of the things you've outlined

2664
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:52,880
in your life

2665
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:53,519
we hope i hope those things the books

2666
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:54,960
people write

2667
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:57,120
the experiences people build the

2668
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:58,000
conversations you have your relationship

2669
01:32:57,119 --> 01:33:01,119
with your ai

2670
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:01,920
systems i hope those all are feeding on

2671
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:03,920
the insights

2672
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:04,960
built upon this ecosystem we've created

2673
01:33:03,920 --> 01:33:07,039
to better your life

2674
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:08,719
and so that's the thinking behind it

2675
01:33:07,039 --> 01:33:10,479
again with the drake equation being the

2676
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:13,119
underlying

2677
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:15,039
driver of value and you know the people

2678
01:33:13,119 --> 01:33:18,158
at colonel have joined

2679
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:21,439
not because we have certainty of

2680
01:33:18,158 --> 01:33:22,879
success but because we find it to be the

2681
01:33:21,439 --> 01:33:24,000
most exhilarating opportunity we could

2682
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:27,440
ever pursue

2683
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:30,238
in this time uh to be alive

2684
01:33:27,439 --> 01:33:32,079
you founded the payment system braintree

2685
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:36,079
in 2007

2686
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:38,960
that acquired venmo in 2012 and then

2687
01:33:36,079 --> 01:33:41,920
in that same year was acquired by paypal

2688
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:41,920
which is now ebay

2689
01:33:42,319 --> 01:33:47,119
can you tell me the story of the vision

2690
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:49,199
and the challenge of building an online

2691
01:33:47,119 --> 01:33:50,000
payment system and just building a large

2692
01:33:49,198 --> 01:33:53,039
successful business

2693
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:54,158
in general i discovered payments by

2694
01:33:53,039 --> 01:33:57,359
accident

2695
01:33:54,158 --> 01:34:01,119
as i was when i was 21

2696
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:02,399
i i just returned from ecuador

2697
01:34:01,119 --> 01:34:03,760
living the money extreme poverty for two

2698
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:04,719
years and i came back to the u.s and i

2699
01:34:03,760 --> 01:34:07,020
was

2700
01:34:04,719 --> 01:34:08,319
shocked by the opulence and

2701
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:09,760
[Music]

2702
01:34:08,319 --> 01:34:12,000
yeah of the united states and i just

2703
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:13,679
thought this is i couldn't believe it

2704
01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:15,520
and i decided i wanted to try to spend

2705
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:17,840
my life

2706
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:19,360
helping others that was the that was a

2707
01:34:17,840 --> 01:34:21,279
life objective that i thought was

2708
01:34:19,359 --> 01:34:21,839
worthwhile to pursue versus making money

2709
01:34:21,279 --> 01:34:23,359
and

2710
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:25,440
whatever the case may be for its own

2711
01:34:23,359 --> 01:34:26,479
right and so i decided in that moment

2712
01:34:25,439 --> 01:34:29,119
that i was going to

2713
01:34:26,479 --> 01:34:29,919
try to make enough money by the age of

2714
01:34:29,119 --> 01:34:32,399
30

2715
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:33,920
to never have to work again and then

2716
01:34:32,399 --> 01:34:37,039
with some abundance of money

2717
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:37,679
i could then choose to do things that

2718
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:39,519
might

2719
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:41,039
be beneficial to others but may not meet

2720
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:43,520
the criteria of being

2721
01:34:41,039 --> 01:34:44,960
you know a standalone business and so in

2722
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:47,520
that process i started

2723
01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:48,719
a few companies had some small successes

2724
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:51,600
had some

2725
01:34:48,719 --> 01:34:52,960
failures in one of the endeavors i was

2726
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,480
up to my eyeballs in debt

2727
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,079
things were not going well and i needed

2728
01:34:54,479 --> 01:35:00,718
a part-time job to

2729
01:34:56,079 --> 01:35:03,198
pay my bills and so i

2730
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:03,920
one day i saw in the paper in utah where

2731
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:06,319
i was living

2732
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,840
the 50 richest people in utah and i

2733
01:35:06,319 --> 01:35:08,960
emailed each one of their assistants and

2734
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:10,560
said you know i

2735
01:35:08,960 --> 01:35:12,399
i'm young i'm resourceful i'll do

2736
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:14,719
anything i just wanna

2737
01:35:12,399 --> 01:35:16,079
i'm entrepreneurial i tried to get a job

2738
01:35:14,719 --> 01:35:20,000
that would be flexible and

2739
01:35:16,079 --> 01:35:22,158
no one responded and then i interviewed

2740
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:23,439
at a few dozen places nobody would even

2741
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:24,559
give me the time of day

2742
01:35:23,439 --> 01:35:26,719
like it wouldn't want to take me

2743
01:35:24,560 --> 01:35:28,960
seriously and so finally i

2744
01:35:26,719 --> 01:35:30,079
it was on monster.com that i saw this

2745
01:35:28,960 --> 01:35:33,118
job posting for

2746
01:35:30,079 --> 01:35:36,158
credit card sales door-to-door

2747
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:36,799
commission i did not know the story this

2748
01:35:36,158 --> 01:35:38,638
is great

2749
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:40,719
i love the head drop that's exactly

2750
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:43,520
right so it was

2751
01:35:40,719 --> 01:35:43,920
the low points to which we go in life so

2752
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:47,040
i

2753
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,158
i responded and you know the person made

2754
01:35:47,039 --> 01:35:49,679
an attempt at

2755
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:51,198
suggesting that they had some kind of

2756
01:35:49,679 --> 01:35:52,639
standards that they would

2757
01:35:51,198 --> 01:35:54,879
consider in hiring but it's kind of like

2758
01:35:52,639 --> 01:35:56,319
if you could fog a mirror

2759
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,239
like you come and do this because it's

2760
01:35:56,319 --> 01:36:00,559
100 commission and so i started walking

2761
01:35:58,238 --> 01:36:03,118
up and down the street in my community

2762
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,639
selling credit card processing and so

2763
01:36:03,118 --> 01:36:07,839
what you learn immediately in doing that

2764
01:36:04,639 --> 01:36:08,319
is if you you walk into a business first

2765
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:10,159
of all

2766
01:36:08,319 --> 01:36:11,359
the business owner is typically there

2767
01:36:10,158 --> 01:36:12,479
it's

2768
01:36:11,359 --> 01:36:13,679
and you walk in the door and they can

2769
01:36:12,479 --> 01:36:15,118
tell by how you're addressed or how you

2770
01:36:13,679 --> 01:36:16,319
walk whatever their pattern recognition

2771
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:17,599
is

2772
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:19,439
and they just hate you immediately it's

2773
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,639
like stop wasting my time i really am

2774
01:36:19,439 --> 01:36:21,599
trying to get stuff done i don't want to

2775
01:36:20,639 --> 01:36:24,159
do a sales pitch

2776
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,119
and so you have to overcome the initial

2777
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:27,519
get out

2778
01:36:25,118 --> 01:36:29,679
and then once you engage when you say

2779
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:31,119
the word credit card processing

2780
01:36:29,679 --> 01:36:33,279
the person's like i already hate you

2781
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:36,319
because i have been taken advantage of

2782
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:38,639
dozens of times because you all are

2783
01:36:36,319 --> 01:36:40,319
yeah weasels and so i had to figure out

2784
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:41,279
an algorithm to get past all those

2785
01:36:40,319 --> 01:36:43,519
different conditions because i was still

2786
01:36:41,279 --> 01:36:44,639
working on my other startup uh for

2787
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,360
the majority of my times i was doing

2788
01:36:44,639 --> 01:36:52,400
this part time and so i figured out that

2789
01:36:47,359 --> 01:36:56,000
the industry really was built on

2790
01:36:52,399 --> 01:36:57,198
people on deceit

2791
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,719
basically people promising things that

2792
01:36:57,198 --> 01:37:00,638
that were not reality and so i'd walk

2793
01:36:58,719 --> 01:37:02,079
into a business and say look

2794
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:03,039
i would give you 100 i'd pull out a

2795
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:04,399
hundred dollar bill and say i'll give

2796
01:37:03,039 --> 01:37:05,279
you a hundred dollars for three minutes

2797
01:37:04,399 --> 01:37:06,638
of your time

2798
01:37:05,279 --> 01:37:08,479
if you don't say yes to what i'm saying

2799
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:10,880
i'll give you a hundred dollars and then

2800
01:37:08,479 --> 01:37:12,879
you usually crack a smile and say okay

2801
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:15,039
what do you got for me son and so i'd

2802
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,400
sit down i just open my book and i'd say

2803
01:37:15,039 --> 01:37:18,000
here's the credit card industry here's

2804
01:37:16,399 --> 01:37:20,399
how it works here are the players here's

2805
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:21,840
what they do here's how they deceive you

2806
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:23,118
here's what i am i'm no different than

2807
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:24,079
anyone else it's like you're gonna

2808
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:25,118
process your credit card you're gonna

2809
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:26,479
get the money in the account you're just

2810
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:27,118
gonna get a clean statement you're gonna

2811
01:37:26,479 --> 01:37:29,198
have someone who

2812
01:37:27,118 --> 01:37:30,719
answers the call when someone asks and

2813
01:37:29,198 --> 01:37:31,599
you know just like the basic like you're

2814
01:37:30,719 --> 01:37:32,960
okay

2815
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:34,000
and people started saying yes and then

2816
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:35,118
of course i went to the next business

2817
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:37,439
and be like you know

2818
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:39,359
joe and susie and whoever said yes too

2819
01:37:37,439 --> 01:37:42,319
and so i built a social proof structure

2820
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:42,880
and i became the number one salesperson

2821
01:37:42,319 --> 01:37:45,920
out of

2822
01:37:42,880 --> 01:37:47,359
400 people nationwide doing this and i

2823
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,199
worked you know half time still doing

2824
01:37:47,359 --> 01:37:50,960
another startup and

2825
01:37:49,198 --> 01:37:52,479
that's a brilliant strategy by the way

2826
01:37:50,960 --> 01:37:55,520
it's very well

2827
01:37:52,479 --> 01:37:58,959
very well strategized and executed

2828
01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:59,360
i did it for nine months and at the time

2829
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:01,520
my

2830
01:37:59,359 --> 01:38:02,639
customer base was making was generating

2831
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:04,480
around

2832
01:38:02,639 --> 01:38:05,920
i think a sick if i remember correctly

2833
01:38:04,479 --> 01:38:07,439
sixty two thousand five hundred four

2834
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:08,960
dollars a month

2835
01:38:07,439 --> 01:38:11,359
were the overall revenues i thought wow

2836
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:13,359
that's amazing if i

2837
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:14,960
built that as my own company i would

2838
01:38:13,359 --> 01:38:16,799
just make sixty two thousand dollars a

2839
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:18,319
month of income passively

2840
01:38:16,800 --> 01:38:20,480
with these merchants processing credit

2841
01:38:18,319 --> 01:38:22,799
cards so i thought hmm

2842
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:24,479
and so uh that's when i thought i'm

2843
01:38:22,800 --> 01:38:28,239
going to create a company and so then

2844
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:30,638
i started braintree and the idea was the

2845
01:38:28,238 --> 01:38:34,158
online world was broken because

2846
01:38:30,639 --> 01:38:35,199
paypal had a uh had been acquired by

2847
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:38,238
ebay

2848
01:38:35,198 --> 01:38:39,759
around i think 2000 1999 or 2000 and

2849
01:38:38,238 --> 01:38:40,079
ebay had not innovated much with paypal

2850
01:38:39,760 --> 01:38:42,800
so

2851
01:38:40,079 --> 01:38:43,198
it basically sat still for seven years

2852
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:45,279
as

2853
01:38:43,198 --> 01:38:46,719
the software world moved along and then

2854
01:38:45,279 --> 01:38:48,079
authorized.net was also a company that

2855
01:38:46,719 --> 01:38:48,960
was relatively stagnant so you basically

2856
01:38:48,079 --> 01:38:50,880
had

2857
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:52,560
software engineers who wanted modern

2858
01:38:50,880 --> 01:38:53,840
payment tools but there were none

2859
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,119
available for them and so they just

2860
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:57,119
dealt with software they didn't like and

2861
01:38:55,118 --> 01:38:58,399
so with braintree

2862
01:38:57,118 --> 01:39:00,238
i thought the entry point is to build

2863
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:01,679
software that engineers will love

2864
01:39:00,238 --> 01:39:04,000
and if we can find the entry point via

2865
01:39:01,679 --> 01:39:05,440
software make it easy and beautiful and

2866
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,800
just a magical experience and then

2867
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:08,559
provide customer service on top of that

2868
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:09,920
it was easy that would be great

2869
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,159
what i was really going after for though

2870
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:14,880
was it was paypal they were the only

2871
01:39:12,158 --> 01:39:17,439
company in payments making money

2872
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:19,760
because they because they had the

2873
01:39:17,439 --> 01:39:22,399
relationship with ebay early on

2874
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:23,600
people created a paypal account they'd

2875
01:39:22,399 --> 01:39:25,279
fund their account with their checking

2876
01:39:23,600 --> 01:39:26,960
account versus their credit cards

2877
01:39:25,279 --> 01:39:29,840
and then when they'd use paypal to pay a

2878
01:39:26,960 --> 01:39:30,960
merchant paypal had a cost of payment of

2879
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:33,119
zero

2880
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:34,960
versus if you have coming from a credit

2881
01:39:33,118 --> 01:39:36,639
card you have to pay the bank the fees

2882
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:39,840
so paypal's margins were

2883
01:39:36,639 --> 01:39:41,600
three percent on a transaction

2884
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:43,360
versus a typical payments company which

2885
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:44,719
may be a nickel or a penny or a dime or

2886
01:39:43,359 --> 01:39:46,960
something like that

2887
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:48,480
and so i knew a new paypal really was

2888
01:39:46,960 --> 01:39:50,079
the model to replicate but

2889
01:39:48,479 --> 01:39:51,359
a bunch of companies had tried to do

2890
01:39:50,079 --> 01:39:52,479
that they tried to come in and build a

2891
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:54,799
two-sided marketplace

2892
01:39:52,479 --> 01:39:56,479
so get consumers to fund the checking

2893
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:58,159
account and merchants to accept it

2894
01:39:56,479 --> 01:40:00,479
but they'd all failed because building a

2895
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:02,719
two-sided marketplace is very hard

2896
01:40:00,479 --> 01:40:04,559
at the same time so my plan was i'm

2897
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:06,239
going to build a company

2898
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:08,400
and get the best merchants in the whole

2899
01:40:06,238 --> 01:40:10,718
world to use our service

2900
01:40:08,399 --> 01:40:12,319
then in year five i'm going to have i'm

2901
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:13,520
going to acquire a consumer payments

2902
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:14,319
company and i'm going to bring the two

2903
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:18,000
together

2904
01:40:14,319 --> 01:40:19,439
wow and so focus on the merchant side

2905
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,760
exactly and then get the payments

2906
01:40:19,439 --> 01:40:24,719
company does the the customer the

2907
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:25,840
whatever the the other side yeah this is

2908
01:40:24,719 --> 01:40:27,198
the planet presented

2909
01:40:25,840 --> 01:40:30,319
uh when i was at the university of

2910
01:40:27,198 --> 01:40:32,479
chicago and

2911
01:40:30,319 --> 01:40:34,158
weirdly it happened exactly like that so

2912
01:40:32,479 --> 01:40:36,799
for four years in

2913
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:38,158
our customer base included uber airbnb

2914
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:41,360
github

2915
01:40:38,158 --> 01:40:42,638
37 signals now base camp we had a

2916
01:40:41,359 --> 01:40:45,759
fantastic collection of

2917
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:47,039
companies that represented the fastest

2918
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,920
growing

2919
01:40:47,039 --> 01:40:50,479
some of the fastest growing tech

2920
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:53,440
companies in the world and then

2921
01:40:50,479 --> 01:40:54,238
we met up with venmo and they had done a

2922
01:40:53,439 --> 01:40:56,000
remarkable job

2923
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:58,000
in building products then something very

2924
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:59,279
counterintuitive which is make public

2925
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,359
your private financial transactions

2926
01:40:59,279 --> 01:41:03,039
which people previously thought were

2927
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:06,238
something that should be hidden from

2928
01:41:03,039 --> 01:41:10,000
others and we acquired venmo

2929
01:41:06,238 --> 01:41:11,359
and at that point we now had we

2930
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,479
replicated the model because now people

2931
01:41:11,359 --> 01:41:13,839
could fund their venmo account with

2932
01:41:12,479 --> 01:41:14,879
their checking account keep money in the

2933
01:41:13,840 --> 01:41:16,719
account

2934
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,400
and then you could just plug them one as

2935
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:20,960
a form of payment and so

2936
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:22,719
i think paypal saw that that we were

2937
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,079
getting the best merchants in the world

2938
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:27,520
we had people using venmo they were both

2939
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:30,399
the up and coming millennials at the

2940
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:33,040
time who had so much influence online

2941
01:41:30,399 --> 01:41:34,799
and so they came in and offered us uh an

2942
01:41:33,039 --> 01:41:38,560
attractive number

2943
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:40,400
and my my goal was not to

2944
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,679
build the biggest payments company in

2945
01:41:40,399 --> 01:41:43,679
the world it wasn't

2946
01:41:41,679 --> 01:41:44,880
to try to climb the forbes billionaire

2947
01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:47,279
list it was

2948
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,800
the objective was i want to earn enough

2949
01:41:47,279 --> 01:41:52,000
money

2950
01:41:48,800 --> 01:41:53,920
so that i can basically dedicate my

2951
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:56,158
attention to doing something that could

2952
01:41:53,920 --> 01:41:59,359
potentially be useful

2953
01:41:56,158 --> 01:42:01,279
on a society-wide skill and

2954
01:41:59,359 --> 01:42:03,279
uh more importantly that could be

2955
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:06,399
considered to be valuable

2956
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:09,519
from the vantage point of 2050

2957
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:11,920
2100 and 2500 so

2958
01:42:09,520 --> 01:42:14,080
thinking about it on a a few hundred

2959
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,679
year time scale

2960
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:17,920
and there was a certain amount of money

2961
01:42:15,679 --> 01:42:20,079
i needed to do that so i didn't

2962
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,600
require the permission of anybody to do

2963
01:42:20,079 --> 01:42:23,118
that and so that

2964
01:42:21,600 --> 01:42:24,639
what paypal offered was sufficient for

2965
01:42:23,118 --> 01:42:25,679
me to get that amount of money to

2966
01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:29,520
basically have a go

2967
01:42:25,679 --> 01:42:32,239
and that's when i set off to

2968
01:42:29,520 --> 01:42:33,280
survey everything i could identify in

2969
01:42:32,238 --> 01:42:34,959
existence to say

2970
01:42:33,279 --> 01:42:37,359
of anything in the entire world i could

2971
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:39,279
do what one thing could i do

2972
01:42:37,359 --> 01:42:40,399
that would actually have the highest

2973
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:43,118
value

2974
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:44,719
potential for the species and so it took

2975
01:42:43,118 --> 01:42:46,639
me a little while to arrive at brain

2976
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:49,840
interfaces but

2977
01:42:46,639 --> 01:42:52,880
you know payments in themselves

2978
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:53,440
are revolutionary technologies that can

2979
01:42:52,880 --> 01:42:57,039
change

2980
01:42:53,439 --> 01:43:00,479
the world like let's not

2981
01:42:57,039 --> 01:43:02,319
let's not uh sort of um let's not forget

2982
01:43:00,479 --> 01:43:06,559
that too easily i mean obviously

2983
01:43:02,319 --> 01:43:10,399
you know this but there's uh

2984
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:12,000
quite a few lovely folks who are now

2985
01:43:10,399 --> 01:43:13,679
fascinated with the space of

2986
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:16,800
cryptocurrency

2987
01:43:13,679 --> 01:43:18,399
and uh where payments are very much

2988
01:43:16,800 --> 01:43:19,119
connected to this but in general just

2989
01:43:18,399 --> 01:43:21,759
money

2990
01:43:19,118 --> 01:43:24,238
and many of the folks i've spoken with

2991
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:26,320
they also kind of connect that to

2992
01:43:24,238 --> 01:43:28,000
not just purely financial discussions

2993
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:29,118
but philosophical and political

2994
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:32,719
discussions

2995
01:43:29,118 --> 01:43:35,519
and they see bitcoin as a way

2996
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:36,399
almost as activism almost as a way to

2997
01:43:35,520 --> 01:43:39,040
resist

2998
01:43:36,399 --> 01:43:40,559
the the corruption of centralized the

2999
01:43:39,039 --> 01:43:42,319
centers of power

3000
01:43:40,560 --> 01:43:44,320
and sort of basically in the 21st

3001
01:43:42,319 --> 01:43:45,679
century decentralizing control

3002
01:43:44,319 --> 01:43:48,479
whether that's bitcoin or other

3003
01:43:45,679 --> 01:43:52,000
cryptocurrencies they see

3004
01:43:48,479 --> 01:43:54,718
that's one possible way to give power to

3005
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:55,439
those that live in uh regimes that are

3006
01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,158
corrupt

3007
01:43:55,439 --> 01:43:59,759
or are not respectful of human rights

3008
01:43:58,158 --> 01:44:02,000
and all those kinds of things

3009
01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:02,960
what's your sense just all your

3010
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,800
expertise with

3011
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:06,239
with payments and seeing how that

3012
01:44:04,800 --> 01:44:07,600
changed the world what's your sense

3013
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:10,319
about

3014
01:44:07,600 --> 01:44:12,400
the lay of the land for the future of

3015
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:14,719
bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies

3016
01:44:12,399 --> 01:44:15,759
in the positive impact it may have in

3017
01:44:14,719 --> 01:44:18,719
the world

3018
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,520
and to be clear my communication wasn't

3019
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:21,840
suggest

3020
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:23,440
wasn't meant to minimize payments or to

3021
01:44:21,840 --> 01:44:27,360
denigrate it in any way

3022
01:44:23,439 --> 01:44:30,638
it was a an attempted communication that

3023
01:44:27,359 --> 01:44:32,000
when i was surveying the world it was an

3024
01:44:30,639 --> 01:44:35,760
algorithm of

3025
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:38,238
what could i individually yes do

3026
01:44:35,760 --> 01:44:40,000
so there's there are things that exist

3027
01:44:38,238 --> 01:44:41,039
that have a lot of potential that can be

3028
01:44:40,000 --> 01:44:43,600
done

3029
01:44:41,039 --> 01:44:45,519
and then there's a filtering of how many

3030
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:46,320
people are qualified to do this given

3031
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:47,600
thing

3032
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:48,880
and then there's a further

3033
01:44:47,600 --> 01:44:50,239
characterization that can be done of

3034
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,000
okay given the number of qualified

3035
01:44:50,238 --> 01:44:55,279
people

3036
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:56,560
will somebody be uh a unique out

3037
01:44:55,279 --> 01:44:58,079
performer of that group to make

3038
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,119
something truly impossible to be

3039
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:00,960
something done that otherwise couldn't

3040
01:44:59,118 --> 01:45:02,960
get done so there's

3041
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,319
there's a process of assessing where can

3042
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:06,079
you add unique value in the world

3043
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:07,599
and some of that has to do with you're

3044
01:45:06,079 --> 01:45:09,920
being very uh

3045
01:45:07,600 --> 01:45:11,199
very formal and calculative here but

3046
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:14,239
some of that is just like

3047
01:45:11,198 --> 01:45:14,960
what do you sense like part of that

3048
01:45:14,238 --> 01:45:16,799
equation

3049
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:18,239
is how much passion you sense within

3050
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,960
yourself to be able to drive that

3051
01:45:18,238 --> 01:45:20,638
through

3052
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:22,560
to discover the impossibilities and make

3053
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:24,639
them possible that's right and so we

3054
01:45:22,560 --> 01:45:26,880
we were a braintree i think we were the

3055
01:45:24,639 --> 01:45:29,279
first company to integrate coinbase

3056
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:30,000
into our i think we were the first

3057
01:45:29,279 --> 01:45:33,039
payments company

3058
01:45:30,000 --> 01:45:35,920
to formally incorporate

3059
01:45:33,039 --> 01:45:37,439
uh crypto if i'm not mistaken for people

3060
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:38,480
who are not familiar coinbase

3061
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:40,399
is a place where you can trade

3062
01:45:38,479 --> 01:45:41,359
cryptocurrencies yeah which was one of

3063
01:45:40,399 --> 01:45:43,359
the only

3064
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:44,880
places you could so we were early uh in

3065
01:45:43,359 --> 01:45:49,039
in doing that

3066
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:50,719
and of course this was in the year 2013.

3067
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:52,319
so an attorney to go in in

3068
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:56,239
cryptocurrency land

3069
01:45:52,319 --> 01:46:00,559
i concur with the the statement you made

3070
01:45:56,238 --> 01:46:02,079
of the potential of

3071
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:04,080
the principles underlying

3072
01:46:02,079 --> 01:46:07,039
cryptocurrencies

3073
01:46:04,079 --> 01:46:07,600
and that many of the things that they're

3074
01:46:07,039 --> 01:46:11,439
building

3075
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:15,199
in the name of money and of

3076
01:46:11,439 --> 01:46:16,238
of moving value is equally applicable to

3077
01:46:15,198 --> 01:46:18,638
the brain

3078
01:46:16,238 --> 01:46:20,718
and equally applicable to how the brain

3079
01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:23,199
interacts with the rest of the world

3080
01:46:20,719 --> 01:46:24,239
and how we would imagine doing goal

3081
01:46:23,198 --> 01:46:26,799
alignment

3082
01:46:24,238 --> 01:46:28,158
with people so it's to me it's a

3083
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:30,159
continuous spectrum

3084
01:46:28,158 --> 01:46:32,079
of possibility and we're talk your

3085
01:46:30,158 --> 01:46:34,158
question is isolated on the money

3086
01:46:32,079 --> 01:46:35,920
and i think it just is basically a

3087
01:46:34,158 --> 01:46:36,638
scaffolding layer for all of society so

3088
01:46:35,920 --> 01:46:38,880
you don't see the

3089
01:46:36,639 --> 01:46:41,039
this money is particularly distinct from

3090
01:46:38,880 --> 01:46:44,560
i don't it's i think we

3091
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:45,920
we at colonel we will benefit greatly

3092
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:47,679
from the progress being made in

3093
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,440
cryptocurrency because it will be a

3094
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:49,840
similar technology stack we will want to

3095
01:46:49,439 --> 01:46:51,599
use

3096
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:52,880
for many things we want to accomplish

3097
01:46:51,600 --> 01:46:56,159
and so i'm

3098
01:46:52,880 --> 01:46:58,159
bullish on what's going on and i

3099
01:46:56,158 --> 01:46:59,359
think it could greatly enhance uh brain

3100
01:46:58,158 --> 01:47:01,679
interfaces and the value of

3101
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:02,799
the brain face ecosystem i mean is there

3102
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:04,639
something you could say about

3103
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,840
first of all bullish on cryptocurrency

3104
01:47:04,639 --> 01:47:07,679
versus fiat money

3105
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:10,960
so do you have a sense that in 21st

3106
01:47:07,679 --> 01:47:13,600
century cryptocurrency will

3107
01:47:10,960 --> 01:47:15,118
be embraced by governments and changed

3108
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,800
of

3109
01:47:15,118 --> 01:47:18,399
the the face of governments the

3110
01:47:16,800 --> 01:47:22,639
structure of government it's the

3111
01:47:18,399 --> 01:47:25,839
it's the same way i think about

3112
01:47:22,639 --> 01:47:30,400
my diet where previously it was

3113
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:32,400
conscious brian looking at foods

3114
01:47:30,399 --> 01:47:34,158
in certain biochemical states am i

3115
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:34,960
hungry am i irritated am i depressed and

3116
01:47:34,158 --> 01:47:37,519
that i choose

3117
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:38,719
based upon those momentary windows do i

3118
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:40,719
eat at night when i'm

3119
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:42,719
fatigued and i have low willpower am i

3120
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:46,158
going to pig out on something

3121
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:46,880
and the current monetary system is based

3122
01:47:46,158 --> 01:47:48,638
upon

3123
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,400
human conscious decision making and

3124
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:52,960
politics and power and

3125
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:54,399
this whole mess of things and what i

3126
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:56,239
like about

3127
01:47:54,399 --> 01:47:58,559
the building blocks of cryptocurrency is

3128
01:47:56,238 --> 01:48:02,000
it's methodical it's structured

3129
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:04,719
it is uh accountable it's transparent

3130
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:06,079
and so it introduces this scaffolding

3131
01:48:04,719 --> 01:48:07,600
which i think again is the right

3132
01:48:06,079 --> 01:48:10,158
starting point

3133
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:12,000
for how we think about building next

3134
01:48:10,158 --> 01:48:13,759
generation

3135
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:15,439
institutions for society and that's why

3136
01:48:13,760 --> 01:48:16,320
i think it's much broader much broader

3137
01:48:15,439 --> 01:48:18,319
than money

3138
01:48:16,319 --> 01:48:20,719
so i guess what you're saying is bitcoin

3139
01:48:18,319 --> 01:48:22,960
is the demotion of the conscious mind as

3140
01:48:20,719 --> 01:48:22,960
well

3141
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:27,440
in the same way you were talking about

3142
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:28,400
diet it's like giving less priority to

3143
01:48:27,439 --> 01:48:30,559
the

3144
01:48:28,399 --> 01:48:31,839
the ups and downs of any one particular

3145
01:48:30,560 --> 01:48:34,880
human mind in this case

3146
01:48:31,840 --> 01:48:36,960
your own and uh giving more power to the

3147
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:40,639
sort of data driven

3148
01:48:36,960 --> 01:48:43,679
yes yeah i i think that is

3149
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:47,679
accurate that cryptocurrency

3150
01:48:43,679 --> 01:48:49,520
is a version of

3151
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:51,279
what i would call my autonomous self

3152
01:48:49,520 --> 01:48:53,679
that i'm trying to build yeah

3153
01:48:51,279 --> 01:48:54,880
it is an introduction of an autonomous

3154
01:48:53,679 --> 01:48:58,079
system

3155
01:48:54,880 --> 01:49:01,920
of value exchange and value

3156
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:02,960
and the process yeah of value creation

3157
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:05,199
in society yes

3158
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:06,639
that's their similarities so i guess

3159
01:49:05,198 --> 01:49:08,559
what you're saying is bitcoin will

3160
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:11,760
somehow help me not pig out at night

3161
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:14,159
or the equivalent of speaking of diet

3162
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,280
if we could just linger on that uh that

3163
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:18,000
topic a little bit

3164
01:49:15,279 --> 01:49:18,719
we already talked about your your blog

3165
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,520
post of i

3166
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:23,118
i fired myself i fired brian the the

3167
01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:26,400
evening

3168
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:29,920
brian who was uh too willing to

3169
01:49:26,399 --> 01:49:32,158
uh not not making good decisions for the

3170
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:34,800
long-term well-being and happiness

3171
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:36,158
of the entirety of the organism uh

3172
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:37,039
basically you were like pigging out at

3173
01:49:36,158 --> 01:49:40,158
night and but it's

3174
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:41,039
interesting because i do this i do the

3175
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:45,039
same

3176
01:49:41,039 --> 01:49:45,039
in fact i often eat one meal a day

3177
01:49:45,439 --> 01:49:52,158
and uh like i have been this this week

3178
01:49:48,719 --> 01:49:55,599
actually especially when i travel

3179
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:58,638
and it's it's funny that uh

3180
01:49:55,599 --> 01:50:01,199
it never occurred to me to just

3181
01:49:58,639 --> 01:50:02,960
basically look at the fact that i'm able

3182
01:50:01,198 --> 01:50:04,399
to be much smarter about my eating

3183
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,560
decisions in the morning in the

3184
01:50:04,399 --> 01:50:08,960
afternoon than i am at night

3185
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:10,480
so if i eat one meal a day why not eat

3186
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:13,920
that one meal a day

3187
01:50:10,479 --> 01:50:16,158
in the morning like i'm not

3188
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:18,079
it never occurred to me this

3189
01:50:16,158 --> 01:50:20,960
revolutionary yeah

3190
01:50:18,079 --> 01:50:21,920
until until you've uh you've outlined

3191
01:50:20,960 --> 01:50:24,560
that so maybe

3192
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:27,359
can you give some details and what this

3193
01:50:24,560 --> 01:50:29,360
is just you this is one person brian

3194
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:30,960
arrives at a particular thing that they

3195
01:50:29,359 --> 01:50:32,960
do but it's fascinating

3196
01:50:30,960 --> 01:50:34,319
uh to kind of look at this one

3197
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,880
particular case study so

3198
01:50:34,319 --> 01:50:38,559
what works for you diet-wise what's your

3199
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:41,118
actual diet what do you eat

3200
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:42,400
how often do you eat my current protocol

3201
01:50:41,118 --> 01:50:45,439
is

3202
01:50:42,399 --> 01:50:46,799
basically the the result of thousands of

3203
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:50,079
experiments

3204
01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:51,760
and decision making so i've i do this

3205
01:50:50,079 --> 01:50:54,000
every 90 days i do the tests

3206
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:55,199
i do the cycle throughs then i measure

3207
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,599
again and then

3208
01:50:55,198 --> 01:50:58,879
i'm measuring all the time and so what i

3209
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:00,800
i of course i'm

3210
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,159
optimizing for my biomarkers i want

3211
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:02,719
perfect cholesterol and i brought

3212
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:04,839
perfect

3213
01:51:02,719 --> 01:51:06,319
blood glucose levels and perfect dna

3214
01:51:04,840 --> 01:51:09,599
methylation

3215
01:51:06,319 --> 01:51:09,599
you know processes

3216
01:51:10,319 --> 01:51:13,359
i also want perfect sleep and so for

3217
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:15,679
example

3218
01:51:13,359 --> 01:51:17,198
recently the past two weeks my resting

3219
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:20,560
heart rate

3220
01:51:17,198 --> 01:51:22,079
has been a 42 when i sleep and when my

3221
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:24,560
resting heart rate's at 42

3222
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:25,920
my hrv is at its highest and i wake up

3223
01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:29,520
in the morning

3224
01:51:25,920 --> 01:51:30,319
feeling more energized than any other

3225
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:32,239
configuration

3226
01:51:30,319 --> 01:51:33,920
and so i know from all these processes

3227
01:51:32,238 --> 01:51:34,559
that eating at roughly 8 30 in the

3228
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:36,079
morning

3229
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:39,039
right after i work out on an empty

3230
01:51:36,079 --> 01:51:41,439
stomach creates enough

3231
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:43,198
distance between that completed eating

3232
01:51:41,439 --> 01:51:45,439
and bedtime where

3233
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:46,559
i have no almost no digestion processes

3234
01:51:45,439 --> 01:51:48,158
going on

3235
01:51:46,560 --> 01:51:49,599
in my body therefore my resting heart

3236
01:51:48,158 --> 01:51:51,439
rate goes very low

3237
01:51:49,599 --> 01:51:52,880
and when my heart rate is very low i

3238
01:51:51,439 --> 01:51:54,238
sleep with high quality and so basically

3239
01:51:52,880 --> 01:51:57,440
i've been trying to optimize

3240
01:51:54,238 --> 01:51:58,079
the entirety of what i eat to my sleep

3241
01:51:57,439 --> 01:51:59,359
quality

3242
01:51:58,079 --> 01:52:00,800
and my sleep quality then of course

3243
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:01,198
feeds into my willpower so it creates

3244
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,520
this

3245
01:52:01,198 --> 01:52:05,118
virtuous cycle and so what i at 830 what

3246
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:07,360
i do is i eat

3247
01:52:05,118 --> 01:52:08,158
what i call super veggie which is it's a

3248
01:52:07,359 --> 01:52:10,880
pudding

3249
01:52:08,158 --> 01:52:12,079
of 250 grams of broccoli 150 grams of

3250
01:52:10,880 --> 01:52:13,199
cauliflower and a whole bunch of other

3251
01:52:12,079 --> 01:52:15,118
vegetables

3252
01:52:13,198 --> 01:52:17,118
that i eat what i call nutty pudding

3253
01:52:15,118 --> 01:52:18,238
which is make the pudding yourself like

3254
01:52:17,118 --> 01:52:20,799
red like veg like

3255
01:52:18,238 --> 01:52:21,598
the um what do you call it like a veggie

3256
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:23,840
mix whatever

3257
01:52:21,599 --> 01:52:25,279
thing is that like a blender yeah the

3258
01:52:23,840 --> 01:52:26,560
pasta can be made in a high-speed

3259
01:52:25,279 --> 01:52:27,039
blender but basically i eat the same

3260
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,400
thing

3261
01:52:27,039 --> 01:52:30,880
every day veggie bowl as in the form of

3262
01:52:30,399 --> 01:52:34,319
pudding

3263
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:37,359
and then a bowl in the form of nuts

3264
01:52:34,319 --> 01:52:37,840
and then i have vegan vegan yes vegan

3265
01:52:37,359 --> 01:52:40,799
and so

3266
01:52:37,840 --> 01:52:41,840
that's fat and that's like uh there's

3267
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:44,320
fat and carbs

3268
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:45,199
and protein and so on everything tastes

3269
01:52:44,319 --> 01:52:48,479
good

3270
01:52:45,198 --> 01:52:49,439
i'd love it i i love it so much i dream

3271
01:52:48,479 --> 01:52:52,319
about it

3272
01:52:49,439 --> 01:52:54,158
yeah that's awesome this is uh and then

3273
01:52:52,319 --> 01:52:54,960
i have a third dish which is it changes

3274
01:52:54,158 --> 01:52:56,879
every day

3275
01:52:54,960 --> 01:52:58,158
uh today was kale and spinach and sweet

3276
01:52:56,880 --> 01:53:03,039
potato

3277
01:52:58,158 --> 01:53:06,638
and then i take about 20 supplements

3278
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:09,039
that hopefully make

3279
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:10,639
constitute a perfect nutritional profile

3280
01:53:09,039 --> 01:53:12,639
so what i'm trying to do is

3281
01:53:10,639 --> 01:53:14,159
create the perfect diet for my body

3282
01:53:12,639 --> 01:53:16,159
every single day

3283
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:17,439
or sleep as part of the optimization

3284
01:53:16,158 --> 01:53:19,118
that's right you're like one of the

3285
01:53:17,439 --> 01:53:20,960
things you're really tracking me

3286
01:53:19,118 --> 01:53:23,279
can you well i have a million questions

3287
01:53:20,960 --> 01:53:25,198
but 20 supplements like what kind or

3288
01:53:23,279 --> 01:53:27,359
like would you say are essential because

3289
01:53:25,198 --> 01:53:30,479
i only take i only take uh

3290
01:53:27,359 --> 01:53:32,000
athletic athletic greens.com

3291
01:53:30,479 --> 01:53:34,479
that's like the multivitamin essentially

3292
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,599
yeah that's like the lazy man you know

3293
01:53:34,479 --> 01:53:36,959
like

3294
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:38,960
like if you don't actually want to think

3295
01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:40,880
about that's what you take and then

3296
01:53:38,960 --> 01:53:41,520
uh fish oil and that's it that's all i

3297
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:44,000
take

3298
01:53:41,520 --> 01:53:46,480
yeah you know alfred north whitehead

3299
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:48,719
said advan uh civilization

3300
01:53:46,479 --> 01:53:50,399
advances as it extends the number of

3301
01:53:48,719 --> 01:53:53,520
important operations it can do

3302
01:53:50,399 --> 01:53:56,719
without thinking about them yes and so

3303
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:57,360
my objective on this is i want an

3304
01:53:56,719 --> 01:53:59,760
algorithm

3305
01:53:57,359 --> 01:54:00,799
for perfect health that i never have to

3306
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:02,480
think about

3307
01:54:00,800 --> 01:54:04,320
and then i want that system to be

3308
01:54:02,479 --> 01:54:05,439
scalable to anybody so that they don't

3309
01:54:04,319 --> 01:54:07,359
have to think about it

3310
01:54:05,439 --> 01:54:08,879
and right now it's expensive for me to

3311
01:54:07,359 --> 01:54:09,439
do it it's time consuming for me to do

3312
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:11,920
it and i have

3313
01:54:09,439 --> 01:54:13,678
infrastructure to do it but the future

3314
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:16,000
of being human

3315
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:17,440
is not going to the grocery store and

3316
01:54:16,000 --> 01:54:19,520
deciding what to eat

3317
01:54:17,439 --> 01:54:20,960
it's also not reading scientific papers

3318
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,760
trying to decide this thing or that

3319
01:54:20,960 --> 01:54:23,840
thing it's

3320
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:25,360
all n of one it's so it's the it's

3321
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:26,000
devices on the outside and inside your

3322
01:54:25,359 --> 01:54:28,158
body

3323
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:29,359
assessing real time what your body needs

3324
01:54:28,158 --> 01:54:31,198
and then creating closed

3325
01:54:29,359 --> 01:54:33,679
systems for that to happen yeah so right

3326
01:54:31,198 --> 01:54:36,079
now you're doing the data collection

3327
01:54:33,679 --> 01:54:37,760
and you're being the scientist it'd be

3328
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:39,359
much better if you're doing just that

3329
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:40,880
if you just did the data collect or it

3330
01:54:39,359 --> 01:54:41,759
was being essentially done for you and

3331
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,599
you can

3332
01:54:41,760 --> 01:54:45,920
outsource that to another scientist

3333
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:47,760
that's doing the no one study of you

3334
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:49,679
that's right because every time i spend

3335
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:51,360
time thinking about this or executing

3336
01:54:49,679 --> 01:54:52,800
spending time on i'm spending less time

3337
01:54:51,359 --> 01:54:54,479
thinking about

3338
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:55,920
building kernel or or the future of

3339
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:59,039
being human and so it's

3340
01:54:55,920 --> 01:55:03,279
we just all have this the budget of

3341
01:54:59,039 --> 01:55:05,519
our capacity on everyday basis and

3342
01:55:03,279 --> 01:55:06,880
we will scaffold our way up out of this

3343
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,280
and so yeah hopefully that what i'm

3344
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,599
doing

3345
01:55:07,279 --> 01:55:10,800
is really it serves as a model uh that

3346
01:55:09,599 --> 01:55:12,159
others can also

3347
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:13,520
you build that's why that's why i wrote

3348
01:55:12,158 --> 01:55:15,039
about it is hopefully people can take it

3349
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:17,199
and improve upon it

3350
01:55:15,039 --> 01:55:18,319
uh i hold nothing sacred i change my

3351
01:55:17,198 --> 01:55:20,479
diet

3352
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:21,920
almost every day based upon some new

3353
01:55:20,479 --> 01:55:22,879
test results or science or something

3354
01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:24,639
like that but

3355
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:27,279
can you maybe elaborate on the sleep

3356
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:31,039
thing why is sleep so important

3357
01:55:27,279 --> 01:55:34,719
and why presumably if like

3358
01:55:31,039 --> 01:55:38,800
what does good sleep mean to you

3359
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:42,079
i think sleep is a contender for

3360
01:55:38,800 --> 01:55:42,079
being the most powerful

3361
01:55:43,840 --> 01:55:47,840
health intervention in existence

3362
01:55:48,319 --> 01:55:52,960
it's a contender i mean it's uh it's

3363
01:55:51,198 --> 01:55:53,439
magical what it does if you're well

3364
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:56,719
rested

3365
01:55:53,439 --> 01:55:58,799
and what your body can do

3366
01:55:56,719 --> 01:56:00,000
and i mean for example i know when when

3367
01:55:58,800 --> 01:56:02,159
i eat

3368
01:56:00,000 --> 01:56:04,238
close to my bedtime and i've done a

3369
01:56:02,158 --> 01:56:06,638
systematic study

3370
01:56:04,238 --> 01:56:08,319
for years looking at like 15 minute

3371
01:56:06,639 --> 01:56:09,760
increments on time of day on where i eat

3372
01:56:08,319 --> 01:56:12,639
my last meal

3373
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:15,280
my willpower is directly correlated to

3374
01:56:12,639 --> 01:56:18,639
my to the amount of deep sleep i get

3375
01:56:15,279 --> 01:56:22,158
so my ability to not binge eat at night

3376
01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:23,679
when rascal brian's out and about

3377
01:56:22,158 --> 01:56:25,439
is based upon how much deep sleep i got

3378
01:56:23,679 --> 01:56:27,199
the night before yeah and so

3379
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:28,719
there's some there's a lot to that yeah

3380
01:56:27,198 --> 01:56:32,638
and so i just i've seen it

3381
01:56:28,719 --> 01:56:34,719
manifest itself and so the i think

3382
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:35,920
the way i summarize this is in society

3383
01:56:34,719 --> 01:56:37,679
we've had this myth

3384
01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:39,039
of we tell stories for example of

3385
01:56:37,679 --> 01:56:41,679
entrepreneurship

3386
01:56:39,039 --> 01:56:43,118
where this person was so amazing they

3387
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:44,800
stayed at the office for three days and

3388
01:56:43,118 --> 01:56:47,679
slept under their desk

3389
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:49,679
and we say wow that's amazing there's

3390
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:52,319
that's amazing

3391
01:56:49,679 --> 01:56:53,199
and now i think we're headed towards a

3392
01:56:52,319 --> 01:56:56,079
state where we'd say

3393
01:56:53,198 --> 01:56:56,799
that's primitive and really not a good

3394
01:56:56,079 --> 01:56:59,920
idea

3395
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:02,400
on every level and so

3396
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:04,960
the new mythology is going to be the

3397
01:57:02,399 --> 01:57:07,920
exact opposite

3398
01:57:04,960 --> 01:57:10,239
yeah by the way just to sort of maybe

3399
01:57:07,920 --> 01:57:13,118
push back a little bit on that idea

3400
01:57:10,238 --> 01:57:13,678
uh did you sleep under your desk

3401
01:57:13,118 --> 01:57:15,359
collects

3402
01:57:13,679 --> 01:57:18,639
well yeah a lot i'm not a big believer

3403
01:57:15,359 --> 01:57:20,799
in that actually i'm a big believer in

3404
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:22,319
in chaos and not giving and like giving

3405
01:57:20,800 --> 01:57:24,719
in to your passion

3406
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:26,319
and sometimes doing things that are out

3407
01:57:24,719 --> 01:57:29,439
of the ordinary that are

3408
01:57:26,319 --> 01:57:32,479
like not trying to optimize health for

3409
01:57:29,439 --> 01:57:35,678
certain periods of time

3410
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:38,399
in uh in lieu of your passions

3411
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:40,399
is a signal to yourself that you're

3412
01:57:38,399 --> 01:57:43,519
throwing everything away so

3413
01:57:40,399 --> 01:57:45,359
i think what you're referring to is

3414
01:57:43,520 --> 01:57:47,679
how to have good performance for

3415
01:57:45,359 --> 01:57:50,479
prolonged periods of time

3416
01:57:47,679 --> 01:57:52,560
i think there's there's moments in life

3417
01:57:50,479 --> 01:57:54,879
when you need to throw all that away

3418
01:57:52,560 --> 01:57:56,000
all the plans away all the structure way

3419
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:59,359
so the

3420
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,039
i i don't this i'm not sure

3421
01:57:59,359 --> 01:58:03,279
i have an eloquent way of describing

3422
01:58:01,039 --> 01:58:06,000
exactly what i'm talking about but

3423
01:58:03,279 --> 01:58:07,679
it all depends on different on people

3424
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:09,198
people are different

3425
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:11,279
but there's a danger of over

3426
01:58:09,198 --> 01:58:13,598
optimization

3427
01:58:11,279 --> 01:58:14,399
to where you don't just give in to the

3428
01:58:13,599 --> 01:58:17,840
madness

3429
01:58:14,399 --> 01:58:21,439
of the way your brain flows

3430
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:21,840
i mean to push back on my pushback is

3431
01:58:21,439 --> 01:58:25,359
like

3432
01:58:21,840 --> 01:58:28,960
it's nice to have like where the k

3433
01:58:25,359 --> 01:58:31,839
where the foundations

3434
01:58:28,960 --> 01:58:34,239
of your brain are not messed with so you

3435
01:58:31,840 --> 01:58:35,199
have a fixed foundation where the diet

3436
01:58:34,238 --> 01:58:36,879
is fixed

3437
01:58:35,198 --> 01:58:38,879
where the sleep is fixed and that all

3438
01:58:36,880 --> 01:58:40,400
that is optimal and the chaos happens in

3439
01:58:38,880 --> 01:58:43,039
the space of ideas as opposed to the

3440
01:58:40,399 --> 01:58:46,839
space of biology

3441
01:58:43,039 --> 01:58:49,599
but you know i i'm not sure if there's a

3442
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:50,800
uh that requires real discipline and

3443
01:58:49,599 --> 01:58:53,119
forming habits

3444
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:54,000
there's some aspect to which some of the

3445
01:58:53,118 --> 01:58:56,158
the best

3446
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:58,479
uh days and weeks of my life have been

3447
01:58:56,158 --> 01:59:03,198
yeah sleeping under a desk kind of thing

3448
01:58:58,479 --> 01:59:08,000
and i don't i'm not too willing to

3449
01:59:03,198 --> 01:59:11,359
let go of things that empirically worked

3450
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:14,319
for things that uh work in theory

3451
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:16,079
and so i'm i'm again i'm absolutely with

3452
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:19,519
you on sleep

3453
01:59:16,079 --> 01:59:20,079
also i'm with you on sleep conceptually

3454
01:59:19,520 --> 01:59:24,000
but

3455
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:25,519
i'm also very humbled to understand that

3456
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,599
for

3457
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:28,639
different people good sleep means

3458
01:59:27,599 --> 01:59:32,000
different things

3459
01:59:28,639 --> 01:59:32,880
i'm very hesitant to trust science on

3460
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:34,719
sleep

3461
01:59:32,880 --> 01:59:36,159
i think you should also be a scholar of

3462
01:59:34,719 --> 01:59:39,439
your own body again

3463
01:59:36,158 --> 01:59:42,638
experiment of n of one i'm not so

3464
01:59:39,439 --> 01:59:44,000
sure that a full night's sleep is great

3465
01:59:42,639 --> 01:59:47,760
for me

3466
01:59:44,000 --> 01:59:50,000
there is something about that power nap

3467
01:59:47,760 --> 01:59:52,639
that i just have not fully studied yet

3468
01:59:50,000 --> 01:59:55,198
but that nap is something special

3469
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:55,840
i'm not sure i found the optimal thing

3470
01:59:55,198 --> 01:59:57,598
yeah

3471
01:59:55,840 --> 01:59:59,279
so like there's a lot to be explored to

3472
01:59:57,599 --> 02:00:01,440
what is exactly optimal

3473
01:59:59,279 --> 02:00:03,039
amount of sleep optimal kind of sleep

3474
02:00:01,439 --> 02:00:05,519
combined with diet and all those cousins

3475
02:00:03,039 --> 02:00:06,399
i mean that all maps the sort of data at

3476
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:07,679
least the truth

3477
02:00:06,399 --> 02:00:09,598
exactly what all everything you're

3478
02:00:07,679 --> 02:00:10,840
referring to here's a data point for

3479
02:00:09,599 --> 02:00:14,880
your consideration

3480
02:00:10,840 --> 02:00:17,760
yes the progress in biology

3481
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:18,719
over the past say decade has been

3482
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:21,920
stunning

3483
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:25,198
yes and it now appears as if

3484
02:00:21,920 --> 02:00:28,239
we will be able to replace

3485
02:00:25,198 --> 02:00:33,039
are organs xenox transplantation

3486
02:00:28,238 --> 02:00:36,399
and so we probably have a path

3487
02:00:33,039 --> 02:00:37,760
to replace and regenerate every organ of

3488
02:00:36,399 --> 02:00:41,839
your body

3489
02:00:37,760 --> 02:00:41,840
except for your brain

3490
02:00:42,399 --> 02:00:45,839
you can you can lose your hand and your

3491
02:00:44,238 --> 02:00:47,359
arm and leg you can have an artificial

3492
02:00:45,840 --> 02:00:49,679
heart

3493
02:00:47,359 --> 02:00:50,559
you can't operate without your brain and

3494
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:52,319
so when

3495
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:54,080
you make that trade-off decision of

3496
02:00:52,319 --> 02:00:55,759
whether you're going to sleep under the

3497
02:00:54,079 --> 02:00:59,198
desk or not and go all out

3498
02:00:55,760 --> 02:01:01,679
for a four-day marathon

3499
02:00:59,198 --> 02:01:02,879
right there's a there's a cost-benefit

3500
02:01:01,679 --> 02:01:04,079
trade-off of what's going on what's

3501
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:05,679
happening to your brain in that

3502
02:01:04,079 --> 02:01:08,000
situation

3503
02:01:05,679 --> 02:01:09,840
we don't know the consequences of modern

3504
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:12,960
day life on our brain

3505
02:01:09,840 --> 02:01:16,400
we don't it's the most valuable organ

3506
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:18,800
in our existence and we don't know

3507
02:01:16,399 --> 02:01:19,920
what's going on if we in how we're

3508
02:01:18,800 --> 02:01:23,279
treating it today with

3509
02:01:19,920 --> 02:01:27,199
stress and with sleep and with dietary

3510
02:01:23,279 --> 02:01:28,960
and to me then if you say

3511
02:01:27,198 --> 02:01:30,479
that you're trying to you're you're

3512
02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:33,920
trying to optimize life for whatever

3513
02:01:30,479 --> 02:01:35,839
things you're trying to do the game is

3514
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:37,520
soon with the progress in anti-aging and

3515
02:01:35,840 --> 02:01:38,560
biology the game is very soon going to

3516
02:01:37,520 --> 02:01:39,760
become different than what it is right

3517
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:41,440
now

3518
02:01:39,760 --> 02:01:43,440
uh with organ rejuvenation organ

3519
02:01:41,439 --> 02:01:47,118
replacement and

3520
02:01:43,439 --> 02:01:50,238
i'm i would conjecture that

3521
02:01:47,118 --> 02:01:50,880
we will value the health status of our

3522
02:01:50,238 --> 02:01:53,919
brain

3523
02:01:50,880 --> 02:01:57,279
above all things yeah no absolutely

3524
02:01:53,920 --> 02:02:00,158
everything's you're saying is true but i

3525
02:01:57,279 --> 02:02:01,118
we die we die pretty quickly life is

3526
02:02:00,158 --> 02:02:06,399
short

3527
02:02:01,118 --> 02:02:09,198
and i'm one of those people that uh

3528
02:02:06,399 --> 02:02:09,920
i would rather die in battle than uh

3529
02:02:09,198 --> 02:02:13,118
then stay

3530
02:02:09,920 --> 02:02:15,359
safe at home it's like yeah

3531
02:02:13,118 --> 02:02:17,279
you you look at kind of there's a lot of

3532
02:02:15,359 --> 02:02:18,960
things that you can reasonably say that

3533
02:02:17,279 --> 02:02:20,800
this is the smart thing to do

3534
02:02:18,960 --> 02:02:22,639
that can prevent you that becomes

3535
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:24,320
conservative that can prevent you from

3536
02:02:22,639 --> 02:02:26,800
fully embracing life

3537
02:02:24,319 --> 02:02:27,519
i think ultimately you can be very

3538
02:02:26,800 --> 02:02:30,719
intelligent

3539
02:02:27,520 --> 02:02:33,679
and data driven and also embrace life

3540
02:02:30,719 --> 02:02:34,719
but i er on the side of embracing life

3541
02:02:33,679 --> 02:02:37,440
it's very

3542
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:38,399
it takes a very skillful person to not

3543
02:02:37,439 --> 02:02:40,479
sort of that

3544
02:02:38,399 --> 02:02:41,839
hovering parent that says no you know

3545
02:02:40,479 --> 02:02:44,559
what there's a

3546
02:02:41,840 --> 02:02:45,119
three percent chance that if you go out

3547
02:02:44,560 --> 02:02:47,599
if you go

3548
02:02:45,118 --> 02:02:49,118
by yourself and play you're going to die

3549
02:02:47,599 --> 02:02:52,480
get run over by a car

3550
02:02:49,118 --> 02:02:56,399
come to a slow or a sudden end

3551
02:02:52,479 --> 02:03:00,399
and uh i'm more a supporter of

3552
02:02:56,399 --> 02:03:02,000
just go out there if you die you die and

3553
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:03,679
that's a you it's a balance you have to

3554
02:03:02,000 --> 02:03:05,439
strike i think long

3555
02:03:03,679 --> 02:03:07,440
there's a balance of striking long-term

3556
02:03:05,439 --> 02:03:10,719
optimization

3557
02:03:07,439 --> 02:03:14,158
and uh short-term

3558
02:03:10,719 --> 02:03:15,840
freedom for me for programmer

3559
02:03:14,158 --> 02:03:17,359
for a programming mind i tend to over

3560
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:20,480
optimize and i'm

3561
02:03:17,359 --> 02:03:23,598
very cautious and afraid of that to not

3562
02:03:20,479 --> 02:03:24,238
over optimize and thereby be overly

3563
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:27,119
cautious

3564
02:03:24,238 --> 02:03:27,519
suboptimally cautious about everything i

3565
02:03:27,118 --> 02:03:29,598
do

3566
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:31,280
and that's the ultimate thing i'm trying

3567
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:33,360
to optimize for it's funny you said like

3568
02:03:31,279 --> 02:03:37,279
sleep and all those kinds of things

3569
02:03:33,359 --> 02:03:38,799
i tend to think this is uh you're being

3570
02:03:37,279 --> 02:03:43,599
more precise

3571
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:46,639
than i am but i think i tend to want to

3572
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:46,639
minimize stress

3573
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:50,799
which everything comes into that from

3574
02:03:49,359 --> 02:03:51,920
your sleep and all those kinds of things

3575
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:53,920
but

3576
02:03:51,920 --> 02:03:56,639
i worry that whenever i'm trying to be

3577
02:03:53,920 --> 02:03:57,679
too strict with myself then the stress

3578
02:03:56,639 --> 02:04:00,560
goes up

3579
02:03:57,679 --> 02:04:01,279
when i don't follow the strictness and

3580
02:04:00,560 --> 02:04:03,520
so

3581
02:04:01,279 --> 02:04:04,880
you have to kind of it's a weird it's a

3582
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:06,079
there's so many variables in an

3583
02:04:04,880 --> 02:04:08,159
objective function as

3584
02:04:06,078 --> 02:04:10,158
it's hard to get right and sort of not

3585
02:04:08,158 --> 02:04:10,638
giving a damn about sleep and not giving

3586
02:04:10,158 --> 02:04:12,479
a damn

3587
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:13,920
bad diet is a good thing to inject in

3588
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:15,439
there every once in a while

3589
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:16,960
for somebody who's trying to optimize

3590
02:04:15,439 --> 02:04:19,039
everything that's

3591
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:20,239
but that's me just trying to uh like

3592
02:04:19,039 --> 02:04:22,000
it's exactly like you said

3593
02:04:20,238 --> 02:04:24,000
you're just a scientist i'm a scientist

3594
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:25,520
of myself you're a scientist of yourself

3595
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:27,279
it'd be nice if somebody else was doing

3596
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:28,719
it and had much better data

3597
02:04:27,279 --> 02:04:30,479
than uh because i don't trust my

3598
02:04:28,719 --> 02:04:31,920
conscious mind and i pigged out last

3599
02:04:30,479 --> 02:04:35,759
night at some brisket

3600
02:04:31,920 --> 02:04:38,158
in la that uh i regret deeply it's still

3601
02:04:35,760 --> 02:04:40,320
uh there's no point to anything i just

3602
02:04:38,158 --> 02:04:40,319
said

3603
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:47,920
what what is the nature of your regret

3604
02:04:44,158 --> 02:04:48,479
on the brisket is it do you wish you

3605
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:50,399
hadn't

3606
02:04:48,479 --> 02:04:52,319
eaten it entirely is it that you wish

3607
02:04:50,399 --> 02:04:56,078
you hadn't as much as you did is it

3608
02:04:52,319 --> 02:04:59,198
that i think uh

3609
02:04:56,078 --> 02:05:02,479
well the most regret i mean if we

3610
02:04:59,198 --> 02:05:05,678
want to be specific i drank

3611
02:05:02,479 --> 02:05:07,439
way too much like diet soda my biggest

3612
02:05:05,679 --> 02:05:08,158
regret is like having drank so much diet

3613
02:05:07,439 --> 02:05:09,678
soda

3614
02:05:08,158 --> 02:05:11,439
that's the thing that really was the

3615
02:05:09,679 --> 02:05:12,000
problem i had trouble sleeping because

3616
02:05:11,439 --> 02:05:13,678
of that

3617
02:05:12,000 --> 02:05:15,359
because i was like programming and then

3618
02:05:13,679 --> 02:05:16,800
i was editing and so i stayed up late at

3619
02:05:15,359 --> 02:05:18,960
night and then i had to get up to

3620
02:05:16,800 --> 02:05:20,320
to go pee a few times and it was just a

3621
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:23,118
mess and the mess of the night

3622
02:05:20,319 --> 02:05:24,319
it was well it's not really a mess but

3623
02:05:23,118 --> 02:05:26,559
like it's so many

3624
02:05:24,319 --> 02:05:27,920
it's like the little things i know if i

3625
02:05:26,560 --> 02:05:30,079
just

3626
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:31,039
eat i i drink a little bit of water and

3627
02:05:30,078 --> 02:05:34,078
that's it and

3628
02:05:31,039 --> 02:05:34,960
there's a certain all of us have perfect

3629
02:05:34,078 --> 02:05:37,359
days

3630
02:05:34,960 --> 02:05:39,039
that we know diet wise and so on that's

3631
02:05:37,359 --> 02:05:41,759
good to follow you feel good

3632
02:05:39,039 --> 02:05:43,039
i know what it takes for me to do that i

3633
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:46,320
didn't fully do that

3634
02:05:43,039 --> 02:05:49,118
and thereby because there's there's an

3635
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:50,078
avalanche effect where the other sources

3636
02:05:49,118 --> 02:05:53,118
of stress

3637
02:05:50,078 --> 02:05:55,279
all the other to do items i have pile on

3638
02:05:53,118 --> 02:05:56,880
my failure to execute on some basic

3639
02:05:55,279 --> 02:05:58,800
things that i know make me feel good and

3640
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:01,199
all that combines

3641
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:02,400
to uh you know to create to create a

3642
02:06:01,198 --> 02:06:04,158
mess of a day

3643
02:06:02,399 --> 02:06:05,839
but some of that chaos you know you have

3644
02:06:04,158 --> 02:06:07,839
to be okay with it but some of it i wish

3645
02:06:05,840 --> 02:06:10,560
was uh was a little bit more optimal

3646
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:12,639
and your ideas about eating in the

3647
02:06:10,560 --> 02:06:14,840
morning are quite interesting

3648
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:16,239
as an experiment to try can you

3649
02:06:14,840 --> 02:06:19,679
elaborate

3650
02:06:16,238 --> 02:06:22,479
are you eating once a day yes

3651
02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:22,960
in the morning and that's it can you

3652
02:06:22,479 --> 02:06:26,638
maybe

3653
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:29,039
speak to how that you spoke

3654
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:30,639
it's funny he spoke about the metrics of

3655
02:06:29,039 --> 02:06:33,840
sleep

3656
02:06:30,639 --> 02:06:35,440
but you're also you know and you

3657
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:37,520
run a business you're incredibly

3658
02:06:35,439 --> 02:06:40,158
intelligent you have to

3659
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:41,199
most of your happiness and success

3660
02:06:40,158 --> 02:06:44,319
relies on you

3661
02:06:41,198 --> 02:06:45,198
thinking clearly so how does that affect

3662
02:06:44,319 --> 02:06:47,279
your mind

3663
02:06:45,198 --> 02:06:49,198
and your body in terms of performance so

3664
02:06:47,279 --> 02:06:50,880
not just sleep but actually like mental

3665
02:06:49,198 --> 02:06:52,559
performance

3666
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:54,800
as you were explaining your objective

3667
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:55,440
function of for example in the criteria

3668
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:59,279
you were

3669
02:06:55,439 --> 02:07:00,238
including you like certain neurochemical

3670
02:06:59,279 --> 02:07:02,479
states like you

3671
02:07:00,238 --> 02:07:04,559
like feeling like you're living life

3672
02:07:02,479 --> 02:07:06,718
that life has enjoyment

3673
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,920
that sometimes you want to disregard

3674
02:07:06,719 --> 02:07:10,158
certain rules to

3675
02:07:07,920 --> 02:07:12,239
have a moment of passion of focus

3676
02:07:10,158 --> 02:07:14,879
there's this architecture of

3677
02:07:12,238 --> 02:07:16,238
the way lex is which makes you happy as

3678
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:17,679
a story you tell

3679
02:07:16,238 --> 02:07:18,879
as something you kind of experience

3680
02:07:17,679 --> 02:07:20,480
maybe the experience is a bit more

3681
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,480
complicated but it's in this idea you

3682
02:07:20,479 --> 02:07:25,118
have this is a version of you

3683
02:07:22,479 --> 02:07:26,799
and the reason why i maintain the

3684
02:07:25,118 --> 02:07:30,078
schedule i do

3685
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:31,760
is i've chosen a game to say i would

3686
02:07:30,078 --> 02:07:35,198
like to live a life

3687
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:38,719
where i care more about what

3688
02:07:35,198 --> 02:07:42,078
intelligent what people

3689
02:07:38,719 --> 02:07:42,399
who live in 2000 the year 2500 think of

3690
02:07:42,078 --> 02:07:45,519
me

3691
02:07:42,399 --> 02:07:46,559
than i do today that's the game i'm

3692
02:07:45,520 --> 02:07:49,840
trying to play

3693
02:07:46,560 --> 02:07:52,239
and so therefore the only thing

3694
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:53,599
i really care about on this optimization

3695
02:07:52,238 --> 02:07:56,959
is

3696
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:57,840
trying to see past myself past my

3697
02:07:56,960 --> 02:08:01,039
limitations

3698
02:07:57,840 --> 02:08:03,520
using xero's principle thinking

3699
02:08:01,039 --> 02:08:04,880
pull myself out of this contextual mesh

3700
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:07,040
we're in right now and say

3701
02:08:04,880 --> 02:08:08,480
what will matter a hundred years from

3702
02:08:07,039 --> 02:08:11,118
now and 200 years from now

3703
02:08:08,479 --> 02:08:13,279
what are the big things really going on

3704
02:08:11,118 --> 02:08:17,679
that are defining reality

3705
02:08:13,279 --> 02:08:17,679
and i find that if i

3706
02:08:18,319 --> 02:08:24,479
were to hang out with diet soda lex

3707
02:08:22,238 --> 02:08:26,638
and diet soda brian were to play along

3708
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:29,678
with that and my deep sleep were to get

3709
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:30,560
crushed as a result my mind would not be

3710
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:32,399
on what matters

3711
02:08:30,560 --> 02:08:34,239
in 100 years or 200 or 300 years i would

3712
02:08:32,399 --> 02:08:36,799
be irritable

3713
02:08:34,238 --> 02:08:39,598
i would be you know i'd be in a

3714
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:42,000
different state and so

3715
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:43,599
it's just gameplay selection it's what

3716
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:46,639
you and i have chosen to think about

3717
02:08:43,599 --> 02:08:49,679
it's what we've chosen to

3718
02:08:46,639 --> 02:08:50,000
uh work on and this is why i'm saying

3719
02:08:49,679 --> 02:08:53,279
that no

3720
02:08:50,000 --> 02:08:55,198
generation of humans have ever been

3721
02:08:53,279 --> 02:08:56,559
afforded the opportunity to look at

3722
02:08:55,198 --> 02:08:59,839
their lifespan

3723
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:02,159
and contemplate that

3724
02:08:59,840 --> 02:09:03,119
they will have the possibility of

3725
02:09:02,158 --> 02:09:06,000
experiencing

3726
02:09:03,118 --> 02:09:07,679
an evolved form of consciousness that is

3727
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,198
unidentifiable it would fall in a zeroth

3728
02:09:07,679 --> 02:09:12,639
category

3729
02:09:09,198 --> 02:09:14,719
of potential that to me is the most

3730
02:09:12,639 --> 02:09:16,840
exciting thing in existence and i would

3731
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:19,679
not trade

3732
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:22,078
any momentary neurochemical state

3733
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:23,840
right now in exchange for that i would

3734
02:09:22,078 --> 02:09:25,279
i'd be willing to deprive myself of all

3735
02:09:23,840 --> 02:09:27,360
momentary joy

3736
02:09:25,279 --> 02:09:29,679
in the pursuit of that goal because

3737
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:33,279
that's what makes me happy

3738
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:36,000
that's brilliant but i'm uh i'm a bit i

3739
02:09:33,279 --> 02:09:36,000
just looked it up

3740
02:09:36,719 --> 02:09:40,319
i just looked up braveheart speech and

3741
02:09:38,719 --> 02:09:42,560
william wallace but

3742
02:09:40,319 --> 02:09:43,920
i know you've seen it fighting you may

3743
02:09:42,560 --> 02:09:46,800
die run and you'll live

3744
02:09:43,920 --> 02:09:48,000
at least a while and dying in your beds

3745
02:09:46,800 --> 02:09:50,960
many years from now

3746
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:52,560
would you be willing to trade all the

3747
02:09:50,960 --> 02:09:55,118
days from this day to that

3748
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:57,039
for one chance just one chance picture

3749
02:09:55,118 --> 02:09:58,960
of mel gibson's saying this

3750
02:09:57,039 --> 02:10:02,078
to come back here and tell our enemies

3751
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:04,078
that they may take our lives

3752
02:10:02,078 --> 02:10:06,238
with growing excitement but they'll

3753
02:10:04,078 --> 02:10:07,840
never take our freedom

3754
02:10:06,238 --> 02:10:09,678
i get excited every time i see that in

3755
02:10:07,840 --> 02:10:10,480
the movie but that's kind of how i

3756
02:10:09,679 --> 02:10:12,078
approach life

3757
02:10:10,479 --> 02:10:14,078
uh and do you think they were trying to

3758
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:16,078
sleep i did we're not tracking their

3759
02:10:14,078 --> 02:10:16,719
sleep and they ate way too much brisket

3760
02:10:16,078 --> 02:10:19,840
and they were

3761
02:10:16,719 --> 02:10:23,520
fat unhealthy died early and

3762
02:10:19,840 --> 02:10:25,360
uh were primitive but uh there's some

3763
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:26,880
there's something in my eight brain

3764
02:10:25,359 --> 02:10:30,078
that's attracted to that

3765
02:10:26,880 --> 02:10:30,880
even though most of my life is fully

3766
02:10:30,078 --> 02:10:32,719
aligned

3767
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:34,480
with the way you see yourself and part

3768
02:10:32,719 --> 02:10:35,840
of it is for comedy of course but part

3769
02:10:34,479 --> 02:10:38,000
of it is like

3770
02:10:35,840 --> 02:10:39,599
i'm almost afraid of uh over

3771
02:10:38,000 --> 02:10:40,319
optimization really what you're saying

3772
02:10:39,599 --> 02:10:42,239
though if we're

3773
02:10:40,319 --> 02:10:43,439
looking at this let's say from a first

3774
02:10:42,238 --> 02:10:45,198
principal's perspective

3775
02:10:43,439 --> 02:10:46,479
when you read those words they conjure

3776
02:10:45,198 --> 02:10:48,158
up certain life experiences

3777
02:10:46,479 --> 02:10:50,399
but you're basically saying i experience

3778
02:10:48,158 --> 02:10:52,879
a certain neurotransmitter state

3779
02:10:50,399 --> 02:10:53,920
when these things are an action yeah

3780
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:55,199
that's all you're saying

3781
02:10:53,920 --> 02:10:57,118
so whether it's that or something else

3782
02:10:55,198 --> 02:10:57,839
you're just saying you have a selection

3783
02:10:57,118 --> 02:11:00,399
for how

3784
02:10:57,840 --> 02:11:01,199
your state for your body and so if you

3785
02:11:00,399 --> 02:11:03,519
as an engineer

3786
02:11:01,198 --> 02:11:05,118
of consciousness that should just be

3787
02:11:03,520 --> 02:11:06,719
engineerable

3788
02:11:05,118 --> 02:11:08,158
and that's just triggering certain

3789
02:11:06,719 --> 02:11:10,078
chemical reactions

3790
02:11:08,158 --> 02:11:11,598
and so whether so it doesn't mean they

3791
02:11:10,078 --> 02:11:12,238
have to be mutually exclusive you can

3792
02:11:11,599 --> 02:11:14,239
have that

3793
02:11:12,238 --> 02:11:16,000
and experience that and also not

3794
02:11:14,238 --> 02:11:17,198
sacrifice long-term health and i think

3795
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,158
that's the potential of where we're

3796
02:11:17,198 --> 02:11:21,919
going is

3797
02:11:18,158 --> 02:11:25,679
we don't have we don't have to assume

3798
02:11:21,920 --> 02:11:27,599
they are trade-offs that must be had

3799
02:11:25,679 --> 02:11:28,880
absolutely and so i guess for my

3800
02:11:27,599 --> 02:11:30,800
particular brain

3801
02:11:28,880 --> 02:11:32,078
it's useful to have the outlier

3802
02:11:30,800 --> 02:11:34,480
experiences

3803
02:11:32,078 --> 02:11:36,238
that also come along with the uh

3804
02:11:34,479 --> 02:11:37,839
illusion of free will where i chose

3805
02:11:36,238 --> 02:11:39,519
those

3806
02:11:37,840 --> 02:11:42,000
that make me feel like it's freedom

3807
02:11:39,520 --> 02:11:43,119
listen going to texas made me realize i

3808
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:45,599
spent so i was

3809
02:11:43,118 --> 02:11:46,639
i still am but i lived at cambridge at

3810
02:11:45,599 --> 02:11:49,520
mit

3811
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:50,319
and i never felt like home there i felt

3812
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:51,920
like home

3813
02:11:50,319 --> 02:11:53,279
in the space of ideas with the

3814
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:54,960
colleagues like when i was actually

3815
02:11:53,279 --> 02:11:56,719
discussing ideas but

3816
02:11:54,960 --> 02:11:58,719
there is something about this the

3817
02:11:56,719 --> 02:12:00,719
constraints the

3818
02:11:58,719 --> 02:12:03,279
how cautious people are how much they

3819
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:06,719
valued also kind of uh

3820
02:12:03,279 --> 02:12:10,399
material success career success

3821
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:13,198
when i showed up to texas it felt like

3822
02:12:10,399 --> 02:12:13,839
i belonged that was very interesting but

3823
02:12:13,198 --> 02:12:15,759
that's my

3824
02:12:13,840 --> 02:12:17,199
neurochemistry whatever the hell that is

3825
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:18,639
whatever whatever

3826
02:12:17,198 --> 02:12:20,158
maybe probably is rooted to the fact

3827
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:20,800
that i grew up in the soviet union it

3828
02:12:20,158 --> 02:12:22,479
was so

3829
02:12:20,800 --> 02:12:24,719
such a constrained system that you'd

3830
02:12:22,479 --> 02:12:27,439
really deeply value freedom and you've

3831
02:12:24,719 --> 02:12:29,118
you always want to escape the demand and

3832
02:12:27,439 --> 02:12:30,319
the control of centralized systems i

3833
02:12:29,118 --> 02:12:32,880
don't know what it is

3834
02:12:30,319 --> 02:12:33,759
but that's but at the same time i love

3835
02:12:32,880 --> 02:12:37,039
strictness

3836
02:12:33,760 --> 02:12:38,560
i love the dogmatic authoritarianism of

3837
02:12:37,039 --> 02:12:40,639
diet

3838
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:42,239
of like the same habit exactly the habit

3839
02:12:40,639 --> 02:12:43,118
you have i think that's actually when

3840
02:12:42,238 --> 02:12:45,678
bodies perform

3841
02:12:43,118 --> 02:12:47,039
optimally my body performs optimally so

3842
02:12:45,679 --> 02:12:49,440
balancing those two

3843
02:12:47,039 --> 02:12:51,760
i think if i have the data every once in

3844
02:12:49,439 --> 02:12:54,479
a while party with some wild people but

3845
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:55,920
most of the time eat once a day

3846
02:12:54,479 --> 02:12:57,839
perhaps in the morning i'm going to try

3847
02:12:55,920 --> 02:13:00,078
that might be very interesting

3848
02:12:57,840 --> 02:13:01,520
but i'd rather i'd rather not try it i'd

3849
02:13:00,078 --> 02:13:03,920
rather have the data that

3850
02:13:01,520 --> 02:13:05,119
tells me to do it but in general you're

3851
02:13:03,920 --> 02:13:08,480
able to

3852
02:13:05,118 --> 02:13:09,920
eating once a day think deeply about

3853
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:12,078
stuff like this

3854
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:14,078
concern that people have is like you

3855
02:13:12,078 --> 02:13:15,118
know does your energy wane all those

3856
02:13:14,078 --> 02:13:17,198
kinds of things

3857
02:13:15,118 --> 02:13:18,639
do you find that it's especially because

3858
02:13:17,198 --> 02:13:21,759
um

3859
02:13:18,639 --> 02:13:23,118
it's unique it's vegan as well so you

3860
02:13:21,760 --> 02:13:23,840
find that you're able to have a clear

3861
02:13:23,118 --> 02:13:26,960
mind

3862
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:27,679
a focus and just physically and mentally

3863
02:13:26,960 --> 02:13:29,760
throughout

3864
02:13:27,679 --> 02:13:30,960
yeah i find like my personal experience

3865
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:35,119
in

3866
02:13:30,960 --> 02:13:38,158
thinking about hard things

3867
02:13:35,118 --> 02:13:40,639
is like oftentimes i feel like i'm

3868
02:13:38,158 --> 02:13:42,238
i'm looking through a telescope and like

3869
02:13:40,639 --> 02:13:43,279
i'm aligning two or three telescopes and

3870
02:13:42,238 --> 02:13:45,598
you kind of have to

3871
02:13:43,279 --> 02:13:46,719
close one eye and move it back and forth

3872
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:48,560
a little bit and just find

3873
02:13:46,719 --> 02:13:50,319
just the right alignment then you find

3874
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:52,000
just a sneak peek at the thing you're

3875
02:13:50,319 --> 02:13:52,559
trying to find but it's fleeting if you

3876
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:54,880
move

3877
02:13:52,560 --> 02:13:55,920
just one little bit it's gone yeah and

3878
02:13:54,880 --> 02:13:58,880
oftentimes

3879
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:59,760
what i feel like are the hot the ideas i

3880
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:02,800
value the most

3881
02:13:59,760 --> 02:14:06,639
are like that they're so fragile

3882
02:14:02,800 --> 02:14:11,360
and fleeting and slippery and elusive

3883
02:14:06,639 --> 02:14:14,000
and it requires

3884
02:14:11,359 --> 02:14:15,039
a sensitivity to thinking and a

3885
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,880
sensitivity

3886
02:14:15,039 --> 02:14:18,880
to maneuver through these things if i

3887
02:14:20,000 --> 02:14:25,599
concede to a world where i'm on my phone

3888
02:14:23,439 --> 02:14:27,118
texting i'm also on social media i'm

3889
02:14:25,599 --> 02:14:28,480
also doing 15

3890
02:14:27,118 --> 02:14:30,479
things at the same time because i'm

3891
02:14:28,479 --> 02:14:33,519
running the company and i'm also feeling

3892
02:14:30,479 --> 02:14:35,118
terrible from the last night

3893
02:14:33,520 --> 02:14:37,520
it all just comes crashing down and the

3894
02:14:35,118 --> 02:14:39,839
quality of my thoughts

3895
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:40,560
goes to a zero i'm just a i'm a

3896
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:42,880
functional

3897
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:44,400
person to respond to basic level things

3898
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:47,760
but i don't feel like i

3899
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:49,759
i'm doing anything interesting

3900
02:14:47,760 --> 02:14:51,039
i think that's a good word sensitivity

3901
02:14:49,760 --> 02:14:53,280
because that's when you

3902
02:14:51,039 --> 02:14:54,719
that's that's what uh thinking deeply

3903
02:14:53,279 --> 02:14:55,759
feels like is you're sensitive to the

3904
02:14:54,719 --> 02:14:57,118
fragile thoughts

3905
02:14:55,760 --> 02:14:58,960
and you're right all those other

3906
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:01,920
distractions kind of dull

3907
02:14:58,960 --> 02:15:02,880
your ability to be sensitive to the the

3908
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:06,000
fragile thoughts

3909
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:09,760
it's a really good word out of

3910
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:12,880
all the things you've done you've also

3911
02:15:09,760 --> 02:15:16,480
climbed mount kilimanjaro

3912
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:16,480
is this true it's true

3913
02:15:17,359 --> 02:15:24,559
uh what do you uh

3914
02:15:20,800 --> 02:15:25,520
why and how and what do you take from

3915
02:15:24,560 --> 02:15:26,880
that experience

3916
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:29,199
i guess the backstory is relevant

3917
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:29,199
because

3918
02:15:29,439 --> 02:15:33,039
that uh in that moment it was the

3919
02:15:31,039 --> 02:15:34,639
darkest time in my life i was

3920
02:15:33,039 --> 02:15:36,560
ending a 13-year marriage i was leaving

3921
02:15:34,639 --> 02:15:37,520
my religion i sold braintree and i was

3922
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:39,520
coming

3923
02:15:37,520 --> 02:15:40,800
battling depression where i was just at

3924
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:44,159
the end

3925
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:46,560
and i got invited to go to

3926
02:15:44,158 --> 02:15:49,359
tanzania as part of a group that was

3927
02:15:46,560 --> 02:15:51,440
raising money to build clean water wells

3928
02:15:49,359 --> 02:15:52,639
and i had made some money from braintree

3929
02:15:51,439 --> 02:15:56,000
and so i was able to

3930
02:15:52,639 --> 02:15:59,199
donate 25 000 and it was the first time

3931
02:15:56,000 --> 02:16:01,679
i had ever had money to donate

3932
02:15:59,198 --> 02:16:04,399
outside of paying tithing at my religion

3933
02:16:01,679 --> 02:16:08,719
it was such a phenomenal experience

3934
02:16:04,399 --> 02:16:09,759
to to contribute something meaningful to

3935
02:16:08,719 --> 02:16:12,560
someone else

3936
02:16:09,760 --> 02:16:13,920
in that form and as part of this process

3937
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:15,039
we were going to climb the mountain and

3938
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:16,239
so

3939
02:16:15,039 --> 02:16:18,078
we went there and we saw the clean water

3940
02:16:16,238 --> 02:16:20,319
whales we were building we spoke to the

3941
02:16:18,078 --> 02:16:21,920
the people there it was very energizing

3942
02:16:20,319 --> 02:16:25,359
and then we climbed kilimanjaro

3943
02:16:21,920 --> 02:16:29,118
and i came down with

3944
02:16:25,359 --> 02:16:30,880
a stomach flu on on day three

3945
02:16:29,118 --> 02:16:32,959
and i also had altitude sickness but i

3946
02:16:30,880 --> 02:16:35,120
became so sick that on day four

3947
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:36,079
we were summoning on day five i came

3948
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:37,920
into

3949
02:16:36,079 --> 02:16:39,359
the camp base camp at fifteen thousand

3950
02:16:37,920 --> 02:16:42,318
feet uh

3951
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:44,239
just you know going to the bathroom on

3952
02:16:42,318 --> 02:16:46,239
myself and like falling all over it was

3953
02:16:44,239 --> 02:16:47,039
just i was just a disaster uh i was

3954
02:16:46,239 --> 02:16:50,398
still sick

3955
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:54,800
so stomach flu and altitude sickness

3956
02:16:50,398 --> 02:16:58,718
yeah and i just was destroyed from

3957
02:16:54,799 --> 02:17:00,318
the situation and plus

3958
02:16:58,718 --> 02:17:01,759
what psychologically one of the lowest

3959
02:17:00,318 --> 02:17:03,279
points yeah and i think that was

3960
02:17:01,760 --> 02:17:05,519
probably a big contributor i was

3961
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:06,479
i was just smoked as a human just

3962
02:17:05,519 --> 02:17:08,000
absolutely done

3963
02:17:06,478 --> 02:17:09,599
and i had three young children and so i

3964
02:17:08,000 --> 02:17:12,638
was trying to reconcile like

3965
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:12,960
this is not a whether whether i live or

3966
02:17:12,638 --> 02:17:16,398
not

3967
02:17:12,959 --> 02:17:18,239
is not my decision by itself i'm

3968
02:17:16,398 --> 02:17:19,519
now intertwined with these three little

3969
02:17:18,239 --> 02:17:21,359
people

3970
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:22,880
and i have an obligation whether i like

3971
02:17:21,359 --> 02:17:25,200
it or not

3972
02:17:22,879 --> 02:17:26,799
i need to be there and so it did it felt

3973
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:27,679
like i was just stuck in a straight

3974
02:17:26,799 --> 02:17:31,279
jacket

3975
02:17:27,679 --> 02:17:31,760
and i had to decide whether i was going

3976
02:17:31,280 --> 02:17:35,200
to

3977
02:17:31,760 --> 02:17:36,880
summit the next day with the team

3978
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:38,800
and it was a difficult decision because

3979
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:40,718
once you start hiking there's no way to

3980
02:17:38,799 --> 02:17:43,840
get off the mountain

3981
02:17:40,718 --> 02:17:46,318
and midnight came and our guide came in

3982
02:17:43,840 --> 02:17:48,239
and he said where you at and i said

3983
02:17:46,318 --> 02:17:49,760
i think i'm okay i think i can try and

3984
02:17:48,239 --> 02:17:53,760
so we we went

3985
02:17:49,760 --> 02:17:56,800
and so from midnight

3986
02:17:53,760 --> 02:17:58,800
to i made it to the summit at 5 a.m

3987
02:17:56,799 --> 02:18:00,959
it was one of the most transformational

3988
02:17:58,799 --> 02:18:04,000
moments of my existence

3989
02:18:00,959 --> 02:18:07,438
and the mountain

3990
02:18:04,000 --> 02:18:09,920
became my problem it became

3991
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:10,880
everything that i was struggling with

3992
02:18:09,920 --> 02:18:12,879
and

3993
02:18:10,879 --> 02:18:14,638
when i started hiking it was the pain

3994
02:18:12,879 --> 02:18:18,959
got so ferocious

3995
02:18:14,638 --> 02:18:22,558
uh that it was kind of like this

3996
02:18:18,959 --> 02:18:25,279
it became so ferocious that um

3997
02:18:22,558 --> 02:18:26,318
i turned my music to eminem and it was

3998
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:28,719
you know eminem was

3999
02:18:26,318 --> 02:18:31,039
is the he was the only person in

4000
02:18:28,718 --> 02:18:32,959
existence that spoke to my soul

4001
02:18:31,040 --> 02:18:35,840
and it was something about you know his

4002
02:18:32,959 --> 02:18:38,159
anger and his

4003
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:39,840
vibrancy and his multi-bench way he's

4004
02:18:38,159 --> 02:18:40,799
the only person i who i could turn on

4005
02:18:39,840 --> 02:18:43,280
and i could say ah

4006
02:18:40,799 --> 02:18:44,558
like i feel some relief i turned i

4007
02:18:43,280 --> 02:18:47,040
turned on eminem

4008
02:18:44,558 --> 02:18:48,079
and um i made it to the summit uh after

4009
02:18:47,040 --> 02:18:49,920
five hours

4010
02:18:48,079 --> 02:18:52,318
but just just a hundred yards from the

4011
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:54,879
top i was with my guide ike

4012
02:18:52,318 --> 02:18:56,079
and i started getting very dizzy and i

4013
02:18:54,879 --> 02:18:57,839
felt like i was

4014
02:18:56,079 --> 02:18:58,959
gonna fall backwards off this this cliff

4015
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:00,398
area we were on i was like this is

4016
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:02,959
dangerous

4017
02:19:00,398 --> 02:19:04,558
and uh he said look brian i i know where

4018
02:19:02,959 --> 02:19:06,879
you're at

4019
02:19:04,558 --> 02:19:08,239
i know where you're at and i can tell

4020
02:19:06,879 --> 02:19:13,438
you you've got it in you

4021
02:19:08,239 --> 02:19:15,760
so i want you to look up take a step

4022
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:16,559
take a breath and look up take a breath

4023
02:19:15,760 --> 02:19:20,000
and take a step

4024
02:19:16,558 --> 02:19:21,279
and i did and i made it and so i got

4025
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:22,879
there and i just

4026
02:19:21,280 --> 02:19:24,800
i sat down with him at the top i just

4027
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:27,839
cried like a baby broke down

4028
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:29,599
did just i just lost it and uh

4029
02:19:27,840 --> 02:19:31,040
so you know he'd let me do my thing and

4030
02:19:29,599 --> 02:19:32,478
then we pulled out the

4031
02:19:31,040 --> 02:19:34,639
the pulse oximeter and measured my blood

4032
02:19:32,478 --> 02:19:36,558
oxygen levels and it's like it was like

4033
02:19:34,638 --> 02:19:38,000
50 something percent and it was danger

4034
02:19:36,558 --> 02:19:39,438
zone so he so he looked at it and i

4035
02:19:38,000 --> 02:19:43,359
think he was like really alarmed

4036
02:19:39,439 --> 02:19:44,719
that i was in this situation and so uh

4037
02:19:43,359 --> 02:19:46,079
he said we can't get a helicopter here

4038
02:19:44,718 --> 02:19:47,119
and we can't get you emergency evacuated

4039
02:19:46,079 --> 02:19:48,558
you've got to go down you've got to hike

4040
02:19:47,120 --> 02:19:49,600
down to fifteen thousand feet to get

4041
02:19:48,558 --> 02:19:52,879
base camp

4042
02:19:49,600 --> 02:19:55,280
and so he we went around the mountain

4043
02:19:52,879 --> 02:19:56,159
i got bound back down to base camp and

4044
02:19:55,280 --> 02:19:58,000
um

4045
02:19:56,159 --> 02:19:59,600
again that was pretty difficult and then

4046
02:19:58,000 --> 02:20:00,959
they put me on a stretcher this metal

4047
02:19:59,600 --> 02:20:03,280
stretcher with this one wheel

4048
02:20:00,959 --> 02:20:04,639
and a team of six people wheeled me down

4049
02:20:03,280 --> 02:20:06,479
the mountain

4050
02:20:04,639 --> 02:20:08,000
and it was it was pretty torturous i'm

4051
02:20:06,478 --> 02:20:09,599
very appreciative they did also the

4052
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:10,959
trail was very bumpy so they'd go over

4053
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:11,840
these big rocks and so my head would

4054
02:20:10,959 --> 02:20:14,799
just slam

4055
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:16,398
against this metal thing for hours and

4056
02:20:14,799 --> 02:20:18,159
so i just felt awful plus i'd get my

4057
02:20:16,398 --> 02:20:20,719
head slammed every couple seconds

4058
02:20:18,159 --> 02:20:22,478
yeah so the whole experience uh was

4059
02:20:20,719 --> 02:20:24,959
really a life-changing moment and that's

4060
02:20:22,478 --> 02:20:25,519
it that was the demarcation of me

4061
02:20:24,959 --> 02:20:27,279
basically

4062
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:28,840
building a new life of basically i said

4063
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:32,159
i'm going to

4064
02:20:28,840 --> 02:20:33,840
reconstruct brian my

4065
02:20:32,159 --> 02:20:35,840
my understanding of reality my

4066
02:20:33,840 --> 02:20:36,639
existential realities what i want to go

4067
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:38,478
after

4068
02:20:36,639 --> 02:20:40,639
and i try i mean as much as that's

4069
02:20:38,478 --> 02:20:44,318
possible as a human but that's when

4070
02:20:40,639 --> 02:20:46,159
i set out to rebuild everything

4071
02:20:44,318 --> 02:20:47,519
was it the struggle of that i mean

4072
02:20:46,159 --> 02:20:50,719
there's also just like

4073
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:53,840
the romantic poetic

4074
02:20:50,719 --> 02:20:56,840
it's a freaking mountain

4075
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:58,000
it's a man in in pain psychological and

4076
02:20:56,840 --> 02:21:00,239
physical

4077
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:01,359
struggling up a mountain but it's just

4078
02:21:00,239 --> 02:21:05,520
struggle

4079
02:21:01,359 --> 02:21:06,880
just uh in the in the face of

4080
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:08,720
just pushing through in the face of

4081
02:21:06,879 --> 02:21:12,318
hardship or nature

4082
02:21:08,719 --> 02:21:13,760
too something much bigger than you

4083
02:21:12,318 --> 02:21:16,559
is that was that the thing that just

4084
02:21:13,760 --> 02:21:19,760
clicked for me it felt like i was just

4085
02:21:16,559 --> 02:21:22,398
locked in with reality and it was

4086
02:21:19,760 --> 02:21:23,920
a death match it was in that moment one

4087
02:21:22,398 --> 02:21:26,559
of us is going to die

4088
02:21:23,920 --> 02:21:27,920
see you were pondering death yeah like

4089
02:21:26,559 --> 02:21:29,840
not surviving yeah

4090
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:33,680
and and it was and that was the moment

4091
02:21:29,840 --> 02:21:35,359
and it was uh the summit to me was

4092
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:37,920
i i'm gonna come out on top and i can do

4093
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:41,359
this and uh giving in was

4094
02:21:37,920 --> 02:21:41,920
it's like i'm just done and so it did i

4095
02:21:41,359 --> 02:21:45,280
locked in

4096
02:21:41,920 --> 02:21:49,040
and uh that's why yeah

4097
02:21:45,280 --> 02:21:50,880
mountains are magical to me uh

4098
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:52,319
i didn't expect that i didn't design

4099
02:21:50,879 --> 02:21:52,799
that i didn't know that was gonna be the

4100
02:21:52,318 --> 02:21:54,639
case

4101
02:21:52,799 --> 02:21:57,759
i and not it would not have been

4102
02:21:54,639 --> 02:21:57,760
something i would have anticipated

4103
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:02,000
but you are not the same man afterwards

4104
02:22:02,719 --> 02:22:07,279
is there advice you can give to uh young

4105
02:22:05,680 --> 02:22:10,159
people today that look at your story

4106
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:12,399
that's successful in many dimensions

4107
02:22:10,159 --> 02:22:14,000
um advice you can give to them about how

4108
02:22:12,398 --> 02:22:17,279
to be successful in their career

4109
02:22:14,000 --> 02:22:18,799
successful in life whatever path they

4110
02:22:17,280 --> 02:22:22,479
choose

4111
02:22:18,799 --> 02:22:26,398
yes i would say listen to advice

4112
02:22:22,478 --> 02:22:29,679
and see it for what it is a mirror

4113
02:22:26,398 --> 02:22:32,478
of that person and then map

4114
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:34,720
and know that your future is going to be

4115
02:22:32,478 --> 02:22:37,039
in a zeroth principle land

4116
02:22:34,719 --> 02:22:38,000
and so what you're hearing today is a

4117
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:39,280
representation

4118
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:41,200
of what may have been the right

4119
02:22:39,280 --> 02:22:44,880
principles to build upon previously

4120
02:22:41,200 --> 02:22:45,600
but they're likely depreciating very

4121
02:22:44,879 --> 02:22:49,119
fast

4122
02:22:45,600 --> 02:22:53,520
and so i am a strong proponent

4123
02:22:49,120 --> 02:22:56,319
that people ask for advice but they

4124
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:56,319
don't take advice

4125
02:22:57,120 --> 02:23:02,560
so how do you take advice properly

4126
02:23:00,799 --> 02:23:04,799
it's in the careful examination of the

4127
02:23:02,559 --> 02:23:06,879
advice it's it's actually you

4128
02:23:04,799 --> 02:23:09,039
the person makes a statement about a

4129
02:23:06,879 --> 02:23:11,199
given thing somebody should follow

4130
02:23:09,040 --> 02:23:13,120
the value is not doing that the value is

4131
02:23:11,200 --> 02:23:14,720
understanding the assumption stack they

4132
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:16,000
built the assumption and knowledge stack

4133
02:23:14,719 --> 02:23:18,398
they built around

4134
02:23:16,000 --> 02:23:20,719
that that body of knowledge that's the

4135
02:23:18,398 --> 02:23:24,639
value it's not doing what they say

4136
02:23:20,719 --> 02:23:26,959
considering the advice but digging

4137
02:23:24,639 --> 02:23:27,760
deeper to understand the assumption

4138
02:23:26,959 --> 02:23:29,679
stack

4139
02:23:27,760 --> 02:23:32,318
like the full person it's almost i mean

4140
02:23:29,680 --> 02:23:34,159
this is deep empathy essentially

4141
02:23:32,318 --> 02:23:36,159
to understand the journey of the person

4142
02:23:34,159 --> 02:23:37,760
that arrived at the advice

4143
02:23:36,159 --> 02:23:39,680
and the advice is just the tip of the

4144
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:40,880
iceberg that's right that ultimately is

4145
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:42,720
not the thing that gives you

4146
02:23:40,879 --> 02:23:43,839
that's right it could it could be the

4147
02:23:42,719 --> 02:23:45,358
right thing to do it could be the

4148
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:46,000
completely wrong thing to do depending

4149
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:48,720
on the assumption

4150
02:23:46,000 --> 02:23:49,439
stack so you need to investigate the the

4151
02:23:48,719 --> 02:23:52,239
whole thing

4152
02:23:49,439 --> 02:23:53,359
is there some are there been people in

4153
02:23:52,239 --> 02:23:56,719
your

4154
02:23:53,359 --> 02:23:59,840
startup in your business journey

4155
02:23:56,719 --> 02:24:01,599
that have served that role of advice

4156
02:23:59,840 --> 02:24:04,159
giver

4157
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:05,040
has been helpful or did do you feel like

4158
02:24:04,159 --> 02:24:08,318
your journey

4159
02:24:05,040 --> 02:24:11,600
felt like a lonely path

4160
02:24:08,318 --> 02:24:12,159
or was it one that was of course we're

4161
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:15,200
all

4162
02:24:12,159 --> 02:24:18,478
we all are born and die alone uh

4163
02:24:15,200 --> 02:24:20,640
but uh

4164
02:24:18,478 --> 02:24:23,039
do you fundamentally remember the

4165
02:24:20,639 --> 02:24:25,279
experiences one where you leaned

4166
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:26,800
on people at a particular moment of time

4167
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:29,520
that changed everything

4168
02:24:26,799 --> 02:24:30,719
yeah the most significant moments of my

4169
02:24:29,520 --> 02:24:34,079
memory

4170
02:24:30,719 --> 02:24:38,159
for example like on kilimanjaro when ike

4171
02:24:34,079 --> 02:24:40,478
some person i'd never met in tanzania

4172
02:24:38,159 --> 02:24:41,760
was able to in that moment apparently

4173
02:24:40,478 --> 02:24:43,358
see my soul

4174
02:24:41,760 --> 02:24:44,960
when i was in this death match with

4175
02:24:43,359 --> 02:24:48,159
reality yes

4176
02:24:44,959 --> 02:24:51,039
and he gave me the instructions look up

4177
02:24:48,159 --> 02:24:51,039
step and so

4178
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:58,960
there's magical people in my life

4179
02:24:54,799 --> 02:25:02,159
that have done things like that and

4180
02:24:58,959 --> 02:25:03,358
i suspect they probably don't know i

4181
02:25:02,159 --> 02:25:06,398
i probably should be better at

4182
02:25:03,359 --> 02:25:11,840
identifying those things and

4183
02:25:06,398 --> 02:25:11,840
but yeah hopefully them

4184
02:25:15,840 --> 02:25:18,960
i suppose like the wisdom i would aspire

4185
02:25:18,079 --> 02:25:22,879
to

4186
02:25:18,959 --> 02:25:26,159
is to have the awareness and the empathy

4187
02:25:22,879 --> 02:25:31,039
to be that for other people and

4188
02:25:26,159 --> 02:25:31,039
not a a retail

4189
02:25:32,079 --> 02:25:38,879
advertiser of advice of tricks and

4190
02:25:35,200 --> 02:25:41,680
for life but deeply meaningful

4191
02:25:38,879 --> 02:25:42,799
and empathetic with a one-on-one context

4192
02:25:41,680 --> 02:25:45,840
with people that

4193
02:25:42,799 --> 02:25:47,599
it really could make a difference yeah

4194
02:25:45,840 --> 02:25:49,200
i actually kind of experienced i think

4195
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:53,840
about that sometimes you know you have

4196
02:25:49,200 --> 02:25:53,840
like a 18 year old kid come up to you

4197
02:25:54,478 --> 02:25:57,679
it's not always obvious it's not always

4198
02:25:56,639 --> 02:26:00,879
easy

4199
02:25:57,680 --> 02:26:02,960
to really listen to them like not

4200
02:26:00,879 --> 02:26:04,478
not the facts but like see who that

4201
02:26:02,959 --> 02:26:06,318
person is

4202
02:26:04,478 --> 02:26:07,920
i think people say that about being a

4203
02:26:06,318 --> 02:26:12,318
parent is

4204
02:26:07,920 --> 02:26:13,760
you know you want to consider that

4205
02:26:12,318 --> 02:26:15,279
you you don't want to be the authority

4206
02:26:13,760 --> 02:26:16,000
figure in a sense that you you really

4207
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:18,159
want to consider

4208
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:20,719
that there's a special unique human

4209
02:26:18,159 --> 02:26:24,079
being there with a unique brain

4210
02:26:20,719 --> 02:26:24,719
that may be um brilliant in ways that

4211
02:26:24,079 --> 02:26:27,200
you are not

4212
02:26:24,719 --> 02:26:29,279
understanding that you'll never be and

4213
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:30,960
really try to hear that

4214
02:26:29,280 --> 02:26:33,040
so when giving advice there's something

4215
02:26:30,959 --> 02:26:34,719
to that so both sides should be

4216
02:26:33,040 --> 02:26:36,720
deeply empathetic about the assumption

4217
02:26:34,719 --> 02:26:38,959
stack

4218
02:26:36,719 --> 02:26:40,079
i love that uh the terminology what do

4219
02:26:38,959 --> 02:26:41,599
you think is the meaning of this whole

4220
02:26:40,079 --> 02:26:44,799
thing

4221
02:26:41,600 --> 02:26:46,800
of life why the hell are we here

4222
02:26:44,799 --> 02:26:49,039
ryan johnson we've been talking about

4223
02:26:46,799 --> 02:26:50,559
brains and studying brains and

4224
02:26:49,040 --> 02:26:52,080
you had this very eloquent way of

4225
02:26:50,559 --> 02:26:55,359
describing life on earth as

4226
02:26:52,079 --> 02:26:57,920
uh as an optimization problem uh

4227
02:26:55,359 --> 02:26:59,280
of uh the cost of intelligence going to

4228
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:01,120
zero

4229
02:26:59,280 --> 02:27:02,880
at first through the evolutionary

4230
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:06,640
process and then eventually

4231
02:27:02,879 --> 02:27:07,199
through building through our technology

4232
02:27:06,639 --> 02:27:09,680
building

4233
02:27:07,200 --> 02:27:11,280
more and more intelligent systems you

4234
02:27:09,680 --> 02:27:14,840
ever ask yourself

4235
02:27:11,280 --> 02:27:18,319
why is doing that yeah i think the

4236
02:27:14,840 --> 02:27:21,600
answer to this question again the

4237
02:27:18,318 --> 02:27:24,559
information value is more in the mirror

4238
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:25,600
it provides of that person which is a

4239
02:27:24,559 --> 02:27:28,639
representation

4240
02:27:25,600 --> 02:27:30,800
of the technological social political

4241
02:27:28,639 --> 02:27:32,159
context of the time so if you asked this

4242
02:27:30,799 --> 02:27:33,438
question a hundred years ago

4243
02:27:32,159 --> 02:27:35,280
you would get a certain answer that

4244
02:27:33,439 --> 02:27:36,880
reflects that time period same thing

4245
02:27:35,280 --> 02:27:40,079
would be true over a thousand years ago

4246
02:27:36,879 --> 02:27:41,519
it's rare it's difficult for a person to

4247
02:27:40,079 --> 02:27:42,079
pull themselves out of their contextual

4248
02:27:41,520 --> 02:27:45,120
awareness

4249
02:27:42,079 --> 02:27:47,840
yeah and offer truly original response

4250
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:50,000
and so knowing that i am contextually

4251
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:52,799
influenced by the situation that i am

4252
02:27:50,000 --> 02:27:55,120
a mirror for our reality i would say

4253
02:27:52,799 --> 02:27:58,799
that in this moment

4254
02:27:55,120 --> 02:28:03,520
i think the real game going

4255
02:27:58,799 --> 02:28:03,519
on is

4256
02:28:03,680 --> 02:28:08,479
that in evolution

4257
02:28:06,959 --> 02:28:11,599
built a system of scaffolding

4258
02:28:08,478 --> 02:28:13,760
intelligence that produced us

4259
02:28:11,600 --> 02:28:16,559
we are now building intelligent systems

4260
02:28:13,760 --> 02:28:16,559
that are scaffolding

4261
02:28:16,799 --> 02:28:21,119
higher dimensional intelligence this is

4262
02:28:19,359 --> 02:28:27,840
developing

4263
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:27,840
more robust systems of intelligence

4264
02:28:27,920 --> 02:28:32,639
in doing in that process with the cost

4265
02:28:31,359 --> 02:28:36,479
going to zero

4266
02:28:32,639 --> 02:28:40,398
then the meaning of life becomes

4267
02:28:36,478 --> 02:28:42,000
goal alignment which is the negotiation

4268
02:28:40,398 --> 02:28:43,519
of our conscious and unconscious

4269
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:45,040
existence

4270
02:28:43,520 --> 02:28:46,800
and then i'd say the third thing is if

4271
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:50,240
we're thinking that we want to be

4272
02:28:46,799 --> 02:28:52,000
explorers is

4273
02:28:50,239 --> 02:28:54,159
our technological progress is getting to

4274
02:28:52,000 --> 02:28:57,359
a point where

4275
02:28:54,159 --> 02:28:59,760
we could aspirationally say

4276
02:28:57,359 --> 02:29:01,439
we want to figure out what is really

4277
02:28:59,760 --> 02:29:04,960
going on

4278
02:29:01,439 --> 02:29:06,479
really going on because does any of this

4279
02:29:04,959 --> 02:29:08,639
really make sense

4280
02:29:06,478 --> 02:29:11,279
now we may be 100 200 500 a thousand

4281
02:29:08,639 --> 02:29:14,559
years away from being able to

4282
02:29:11,280 --> 02:29:15,920
poke our way out of whatever is is going

4283
02:29:14,559 --> 02:29:18,398
on

4284
02:29:15,920 --> 02:29:20,000
but it's interesting that we could even

4285
02:29:18,398 --> 02:29:22,879
state an aspiration

4286
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:23,600
to say we want to poke at this question

4287
02:29:22,879 --> 02:29:26,959
but i'd say

4288
02:29:23,600 --> 02:29:27,840
in this moment of time the meaning of

4289
02:29:26,959 --> 02:29:31,759
life

4290
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:35,359
is that we can build a future state

4291
02:29:31,760 --> 02:29:38,079
of existence that is more fantastic than

4292
02:29:35,359 --> 02:29:40,000
anything we could ever imagine the

4293
02:29:38,079 --> 02:29:43,520
striving

4294
02:29:40,000 --> 02:29:48,478
for something more amazing

4295
02:29:43,520 --> 02:29:48,479
and that defies expectations

4296
02:29:48,840 --> 02:29:56,000
that we would consider bewildering

4297
02:29:52,639 --> 02:29:57,680
and all the things that that that's and

4298
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,520
and i guess the last thing if there's

4299
02:29:57,680 --> 02:30:01,120
multiple meanings of life it would be

4300
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:01,920
infinite games you know james karst

4301
02:30:01,120 --> 02:30:04,640
wrote the book

4302
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:05,840
finite games infinite games the only

4303
02:30:04,639 --> 02:30:08,000
game

4304
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:09,520
to play right now is to keep playing the

4305
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:11,280
game

4306
02:30:09,520 --> 02:30:12,560
and so this goes back to the algorithm

4307
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:15,359
of the lex algorithm

4308
02:30:12,559 --> 02:30:17,119
of diet soda and brisket and pursuing

4309
02:30:15,359 --> 02:30:18,159
the passion i'm what i'm suggesting is

4310
02:30:17,120 --> 02:30:19,760
there is a

4311
02:30:18,159 --> 02:30:22,478
there's a moment here where we can

4312
02:30:19,760 --> 02:30:25,359
contemplate playing infinite games

4313
02:30:22,478 --> 02:30:26,398
therefore it may make sense to err on

4314
02:30:25,359 --> 02:30:28,159
the side of making sure

4315
02:30:26,398 --> 02:30:29,760
one is in a situation to be plain

4316
02:30:28,159 --> 02:30:32,719
infinite games if that

4317
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:35,200
opportunity arises so just the landscape

4318
02:30:32,719 --> 02:30:35,920
of possibilities changing very very fast

4319
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:37,280
and therefore

4320
02:30:35,920 --> 02:30:38,639
our old algorithms of how we might

4321
02:30:37,280 --> 02:30:40,319
assess risk assessment and what things

4322
02:30:38,639 --> 02:30:41,920
we might pursue and why

4323
02:30:40,318 --> 02:30:44,000
those assumptions may fall away very

4324
02:30:41,920 --> 02:30:46,000
quickly

4325
02:30:44,000 --> 02:30:47,840
well i think i speak for a lot of people

4326
02:30:46,000 --> 02:30:50,719
when i say that

4327
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:51,359
the game you mr brian johnson have been

4328
02:30:50,719 --> 02:30:53,519
playing

4329
02:30:51,359 --> 02:30:56,000
is quite incredible thank you so much

4330
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:57,040
for talking today thanks lex

4331
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:58,959
thanks for listening to this

4332
02:30:57,040 --> 02:31:00,000
conversation with brian johnson and

4333
02:30:58,959 --> 02:31:03,279
thank you to

4334
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:05,760
four sigmatic netsuite grammarly

4335
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:08,159
and expressvpn check them out in the

4336
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:10,000
description to support this podcast

4337
02:31:08,159 --> 02:31:11,840
and now let me leave you with some words

4338
02:31:10,000 --> 02:31:14,959
from diane ackerman

4339
02:31:11,840 --> 02:31:17,040
our brain is a crowded chemistry lab

4340
02:31:14,959 --> 02:31:18,559
bustling with non-stop neural

4341
02:31:17,040 --> 02:31:20,160
conversations

4342
02:31:18,559 --> 02:31:29,840
thank you for listening and hope to see

4343
02:31:20,159 --> 02:31:31,920
you next time

4344
02:31:29,840 --> 02:31:31,920
