00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,000
buller a mathematics educator at

00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,240
stanford and co-founder of youcubed.org

00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,480
that seeks to inspire young minds with

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,559
the beauty of mathematics

00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,519
this is the lex friedman podcast and

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:25,439
here is my conversation with joe bowler

10
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,118
what to you is beautiful about

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,640
mathematics

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,480
i love

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,920
a mathematics that some people don't

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,640
even think of as mathematics which is

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,719
beautiful creative

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,120
mathematics where we look at maths in

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,558
different ways we visualize it

18
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:44,878
we think about

19
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,878
different solutions to problems a lot of

20
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:49,519
people think of maths as

21
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,439
you have one method and one answer

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,960
and what i love about maths is the

23
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:53,919
multiple different ways you can see

24
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,439
things

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,719
different methods different ways of

26
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,119
seeing different

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,198
in some cases different solutions

28
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:03,839
so that is what is beautiful to me about

29
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,558
mathematics that you can see and solve

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,799
it

31
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:09,840
in many different ways and

32
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,680
also the sad part that many people think

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680
that maths is just

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,680
one answer and one method

35
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,920
so to you the beautiful the beauty

36
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,000
emerges when you have a problem with a

37
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,118
solution and you start adding other

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,519
solutions

39
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,599
simpler solutions

40
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:28,079
weirder solutions more interesting some

41
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:30,640
of their visual some of their algebraic

42
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,879
geometry all that kind of stuff yeah i

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,280
mean i i always say that you can take

44
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:37,519
any maths area and make it visual

45
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,280
and we say to teachers give us your most

46
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,679
dry boring

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,920
maths and we'll make it a visual

48
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,600
interesting creative problem and

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,799
turns out you can do that with any area

50
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,199
of maths

51
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,200
and i think we've given

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,240
p it's been a great disservice to kids

53
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,079
and others that it's always been numbers

54
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,759
lots and lots of numbers

55
00:01:56,078 --> 00:02:00,158
numbers can be great but you can think

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,319
about maths in other ways besides

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,960
numbers do you find that

58
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:06,478
most people are better visual learners

59
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:08,639
or is this just something that's

60
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:10,560
complementary

61
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:12,318
what's the kind of the full spectrum of

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
students in the way they like to explore

63
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:17,439
math would you say there's definitely

64
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,120
people who come into the classes i do

65
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,000
who are more interested in visual

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,080
thinking and like visual approaches but

67
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,159
it turns out what the neuroscience is

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,560
telling us is that when we think about

69
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,079
maths there are two visual pathways in

70
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,439
the brain and

71
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,800
we should all be thinking about it

72
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:34,639
visually

73
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
some approaches have been to say well

74
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,878
you're a visual learner so we'll give

75
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,599
you visuals and you're

76
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,159
not a visual learner but

77
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,839
actually if you think you're not a

78
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:47,519
visual learner it's probably more

79
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,800
important that you have a visual

80
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,719
approach

81
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
so you can develop that part of your

82
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,400
brain so you were saying that there's

83
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,760
some kind of interconnected aspect to it

84
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,158
so the visual connects with the

85
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,079
non-visual yeah so this is what the

86
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:01,598
neuroscience has shown us that when you

87
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,360
work on a maths problem there are five

88
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:05,039
different brain pathways

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,800
and that the most

90
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,799
high achieving people in the world are

91
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,480
people who have more connections between

92
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,719
these pathways

93
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:15,759
so if you see a maths problem with

94
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,280
numbers but you also see it visually

95
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,759
that will cause a connection to happen

96
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,519
in your brain between these pathways

97
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,799
and if you maybe write about it with

98
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,280
words that would cause another

99
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,959
connection or maybe you build it with

100
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,318
something physical that would cause a

101
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,200
different connection

102
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,598
and

103
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,598
what we want for kids is we call it a

104
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,238
multi-dimensional experience of math

105
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:37,759
seeing it in different ways experiencing

106
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,840
it in different ways

107
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,719
that will cause that great connected

108
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,000
brain

109
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:43,598
you know there's these stories of

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,759
physicists doing the same i find

111
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:47,598
physicists are often better at

112
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:49,679
building that part of their brain of

113
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,000
using visualization for intuition

114
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
building because you ultimately want to

115
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,318
understand

116
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,319
the like the deepest secret underneath

117
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,318
this problem and for that you have to

118
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:02,399
intuit your way there yeah and you you

119
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:03,839
mentioned offline that um one of the

120
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,760
ways you might approach a problem is to

121
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,719
try to tell a story about it

122
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,959
and some of it is like legend but i'm

123
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:12,479
sure it's not always is you know you

124
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,799
have einstein

125
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:17,199
uh thinking about a train

126
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:19,600
you know and the speed of light and you

127
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,919
know that kind of intuition is useful

128
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,919
yeah you start to like imagine

129
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,519
a physical world like how does

130
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,039
this idea manifest itself in the

131
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,879
physical world and then start playing in

132
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,400
your mind with that physical world and

133
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,240
think is this going to be true is this

134
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:34,638
going to be true right

135
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,759
einstein is well known for thinking

136
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,720
visually

137
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,199
and

138
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,360
people talk about how he really didn't

139
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,600
want to go anywhere with problems

140
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,199
without thinking about them visually but

141
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,040
the other thing you mentioned that

142
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,120
sparked something for me is

143
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,280
thinking with intuition like having

144
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,120
intuition about maths problems

145
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:54,879
that's another thing that's often absent

146
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,478
in maths class the idea that you might

147
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,800
think about a problem and

148
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,719
use your intuition

149
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,720
but so important

150
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,160
and when mathematicians are interviewed

151
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,120
they will very frequently talk about the

152
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,600
role of intuition in solving problems

153
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,120
but not commonly

154
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,759
acknowledged or

155
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,840
brought into education yeah i mean

156
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,120
that's what it is like

157
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,359
if if you

158
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,199
task yourself with building an intuition

159
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,319
about a problem

160
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,000
that's what

161
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,439
that's where you start to pull in like

162
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,439
um

163
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,879
what is the pattern i'm seeing in order

164
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,600
to understand the pattern you might want

165
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:34,159
to then start utilizing visualization

166
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,680
but ultimately that's all in service of

167
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,280
like

168
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,199
solving the puzzle

169
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:41,599
like cracking it open yeah you get the

170
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,840
simple explanation of what why

171
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,439
why things are the way they are

172
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:46,959
as opposed to um

173
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:48,639
like you said having a particular

174
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:49,918
algorithm that you can then execute to

175
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,000
solve the problem

176
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:54,319
yeah but it's hard it's hard yeah

177
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,918
reasoning is really hard yeah it's it's

178
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,800
hard i mean

179
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,879
i love to value what's hard in maths

180
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,800
instead of being afraid of it we know

181
00:06:00,879 --> 00:06:04,959
that when you struggle that's actually a

182
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,560
really good time for your brain you want

183
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,918
to be struggling when you're thinking

184
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,680
about things so

185
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,918
if it's hard to think intuitively about

186
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,519
something that's probably a really good

187
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,680
time for your brain

188
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:17,839
i i used to work with somebody called

189
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,600
sebastian thoran who

190
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,839
it's a great sort of mathematician you

191
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,439
might think of him an ai person and

192
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:25,038
i remember in one interview i did with

193
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,519
him he talked about how they'd built

194
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,279
robots i think for the smithsonian

195
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,318
and how they were having this trouble

196
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:33,119
with them picking up white noise

197
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:34,800
and

198
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,360
he said they had to solve it they had to

199
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,120
work out what's going on and how he

200
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,199
intuitively

201
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,079
worked out what the problem was

202
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:46,080
but then it took him three weeks to show

203
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,560
it mathematically i thought that was

204
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:51,758
really interesting that how you can have

205
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,199
this intuition and know something works

206
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,199
it's kind of different from going

207
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,879
through that long mathematical process

208
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,520
of proving it

209
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:01,519
but so important yeah i think probably

210
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:03,918
our brains are evolved

211
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:06,639
as like intuition machines

212
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,159
and the uh the the math of like showing

213
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,639
it like

214
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,639
formally is probably an extra thing that

215
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,800
we're not designed for you see that with

216
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,960
feynman and his

217
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,680
i mean it's just all of these physicists

218
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,598
definitely you see um

219
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,400
starting with intuition sometimes

220
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,879
starting with an experiment

221
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,719
and then the experiment inspires

222
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,800
intuition but you can think of an

223
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,240
experiment as a kind of visualization

224
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,680
right just like let's

225
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,918
let's take whatever the heck we're

226
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,079
looking at and draw it

227
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,799
and and draw like uh the pattern as it

228
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,719
evolves as the thing grows for n equals

229
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,439
one for n equals two n equals three and

230
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,639
you start uh to play with it and then in

231
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,639
the modern day which i loved uh doing

232
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,478
is you know you can write a program that

233
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,000
then visualizes it for you right and

234
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,439
then you can start exploring it

235
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,839
programmatically

236
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,478
and that that and

237
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,318
then you can do so interactively too i

238
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,159
tend to not

239
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,759
uh like interactive because the way it

240
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,439
takes to way too much work because you

241
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,840
have to click and move and stuff i love

242
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:11,839
to interact through writing programs

243
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:13,598
that's my particular brain software

244
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,679
engineer so like

245
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,159
you can you can uh do all these kinds of

246
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,720
visualizations uh and then there's the

247
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,120
tools of visualization like color

248
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,639
uh all those kinds of things yeah that

249
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,439
you're absolutely right they're actually

250
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,840
not

251
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:30,000
taught very much right like the art of

252
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:31,198
visualization not taught

253
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,080
and

254
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,479
we love as well color coding like when

255
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:39,038
you represent something mathematically

256
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,839
you can show color to show the growth

257
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,158
yeah and kind of code that so if i have

258
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,560
an algebraic expression for a pattern

259
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,039
maybe i show the x with a certain color

260
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,359
but also write in that color so you can

261
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:54,480
see the relationship

262
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,800
very cool and um yeah we particularly in

263
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,800
our work with elementary teachers

264
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,439
many of them come to our workshops and

265
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:03,759
they're literally in tears when they see

266
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,760
things making sense visually

267
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,240
because they've spent their whole lives

268
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,879
think not realizing you can really

269
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,639
understand things with these visuals

270
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,039
it's quite powerful

271
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,759
you say that uh there's something about

272
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:19,838
there's something valuable to learning

273
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:22,000
when the thing that you're doing is

274
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:24,560
challenging it's difficult so a lot of

275
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,080
people say you know math is hard or math

276
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:28,000
is too hard

277
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,120
or too hard for me

278
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,360
do you think

279
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:35,839
math should be easy or should it be hard

280
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,278
i think it's great when

281
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,440
things are challenging but there's

282
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:41,120
something that that's really key to

283
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,640
being able to

284
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,440
deal with challenging maths and that is

285
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,360
knowing that you can do it and i think

286
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,440
the problem in education is a lot of

287
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,039
people have got this idea that you're

288
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,000
either born with a math sprain or you're

289
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:55,838
not

290
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,399
so when they start to struggle they

291
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:00,240
think oh i don't have that maths brain

292
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,919
and then they will literally sort of

293
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,240
switch off in their brain and things

294
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,519
will go downhill from that point so

295
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,519
struggle becomes a lot easier and

296
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,879
you're able to struggle if you don't

297
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,679
have that idea

298
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,360
but you know that you you can do it you

299
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:18,639
have to go through this struggle to get

300
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:21,278
there but you're you're able to do that

301
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:23,199
and so we're hampered in being able to

302
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,519
struggle with these ideas we've been

303
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,079
given about what we can do i ask a

304
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,240
difficult question here yes so there's

305
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,319
kind of um

306
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,919
i don't know what the right term is but

307
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,600
some people

308
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,559
are um

309
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,320
struggle with learning in different ways

310
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:42,399
like their brain is

311
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,079
constructed in different ways

312
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,600
and um

313
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,239
how much should

314
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,278
as educators should we make room for

315
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,639
that

316
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,039
so how do you know the difference

317
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:56,078
between this is hard and i don't like

318
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:58,000
doing hard things versus my brain is

319
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,679
wired in a way where i need to learn in

320
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,919
very different ways i can't learn it

321
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,359
this way how do you find that

322
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,240
line how do you operate in that gray

323
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,720
area so this is why being a teacher is

324
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,039
so hard and people really don't

325
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,959
appreciate how difficult teaching is

326
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:16,240
when you're faced with i know 30

327
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:19,039
students who think in different ways and

328
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,959
but this is also why i believe it's so

329
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:22,799
important to have this multi-dimensional

330
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:25,919
approach to maths we've really offered

331
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:27,519
it in one way which is

332
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,679
here's some numbers in a method you

333
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,120
follow me do what i just did and then

334
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,199
reproduce it

335
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,440
and so there are some kids who like

336
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,560
doing that and they do well and a lot of

337
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,959
kids who

338
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:42,719
don't like doing it and don't do well

339
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:44,239
but when you open up maths and you give

340
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
you let kids experience it in different

341
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,519
ways maybe visually with numbers with

342
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,839
words

343
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,519
what happens is kids

344
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,480
there are many more kids who can access

345
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,000
it

346
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,320
so those different

347
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,679
brain wirings you're talking about where

348
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,879
some people are just

349
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,159
more able to do something in a

350
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,320
particular way

351
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,639
that's why we want to that's one of the

352
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,480
reasons we want to open it up

353
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,320
so that there are different ways of

354
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,120
accessing it

355
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,000
and then that's not really a problem

356
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,399
so

357
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,360
i grew up in the soviet union

358
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,320
and uh fell in love with math early i

359
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,360
was forced into math early and fell in

360
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,920
love

361
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,240
through force that's good well you fell

362
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:28,000
in love with other people well but there

363
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,799
uh something we talked about a little

364
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,958
bit is there's such a

365
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,879
value for excellence

366
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,759
uh it's competitive

367
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:40,078
and it's also everybody kind of looks up

368
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,039
the the definition

369
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,199
of

370
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,199
success is being

371
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,879
in a particular class is you know being

372
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:50,000
really good at it

373
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:52,000
um and like it's not improving it's like

374
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,679
being really good i mean we are much

375
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,799
more like that with sports for example

376
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,799
we're not

377
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,639
it's like it's understood you know

378
00:12:56,799 --> 00:12:59,679
you're going to star on the basketball

379
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,600
team

380
00:12:59,679 --> 00:13:03,278
if uh you're going to start on the

381
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,360
basketball team if you're going to be

382
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,799
better than the other guys the other

383
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,600
girls on the team

384
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,199
uh

385
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,399
so

386
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,160
that coupled with the belief this could

387
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,799
be partially a communist belief i don't

388
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,120
know but the belief that everybody is

389
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,120
capable of being great

390
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,078
but if you're not great that's your

391
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,759
fault

392
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:26,879
and you need to work harder and i

393
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:29,519
remember i had a sense that um probably

394
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:32,159
delusional but i could win a nobel prize

395
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,278
i don't even know what that entails

396
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:38,559
um but i thought um

397
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:40,320
like uh my dad early on told me

398
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,638
just off hand and it always stuck with

399
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,040
me that if you if you can figure out how

400
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,959
to build a time machine how to travel

401
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,519
back in time it will probably give you a

402
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,518
nobel prize and i remember early in my

403
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:54,320
life thinking i'm going to invent the

404
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:57,120
time machine and like like the tools of

405
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,079
mathematics were in service of that

406
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,320
dream of winning the nobel prize and

407
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:04,399
it's silly i didn't really think in

408
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,720
those concrete terms but i just thought

409
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,799
i could be great feeling

410
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,040
and then then when you struggle the

411
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:13,759
belief that you could be great

412
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:15,919
is like struggle is good right pushes

413
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,439
you on yeah and so the other thing about

414
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,639
the soviet system

415
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,959
that might

416
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,399
love to hear your comments about is just

417
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:26,719
the sheer like hours of math like the

418
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:29,759
number of courses you're talking about

419
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,000
a lot of geometry a lot more i think in

420
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:34,078
the american system you take maybe one

421
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,198
year of geometry in high school yeah in

422
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,039
high school

423
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:38,479
first of all geometry is beautiful it's

424
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,639
visual and then you get to reason

425
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,959
through proofs and stuff like that in in

426
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,600
russia i remember just being nailed over

427
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,518
and over would you it was just non-stop

428
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,600
and then of course there's different

429
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,480
perspectives on calculus and just the

430
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,480
whole

431
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,959
the sense was

432
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,039
that math is like

433
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,559
like fundamental to the development of

434
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:59,439
the human mind

435
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,518
so

436
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,399
math but also science and literature by

437
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,759
the way

438
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,720
was also hit very hard like we read a

439
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,039
lot of serious adult stuff america does

440
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,199
that a little bit too they challenge

441
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:14,958
young adults with good literature but

442
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:18,240
they don't challenge adults very much

443
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:19,599
with math math so those two things um

444
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,879
valuing

445
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,600
excellence

446
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:25,838
and just a lot of math in the curriculum

447
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,440
do you think do you think do you find

448
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,440
that interesting because it seems to

449
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,279
have been successful yeah i think that's

450
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,120
very interesting and

451
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,039
there is a lot of success people coming

452
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,799
through the soviet system i think

453
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:39,439
something that's very different to the

454
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:41,439
us and other countries in the world

455
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,279
is that idea that excellence is

456
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,880
important and you can get there if you

457
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,720
work hard

458
00:15:44,879 --> 00:15:48,240
in the u.s

459
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,000
there's an idea that excellence is

460
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,079
important but then kids are given the

461
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,159
idea in many ways

462
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,159
that you can either do it or you're one

463
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:58,399
of the people who can't

464
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,679
so many students in the school system

465
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,240
think they're one of the kids who can't

466
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:04,719
so there's no point in trying hard

467
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,120
because you're never going to get there

468
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,399
so if you can switch that

469
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,120
idea it would be huge and it seems from

470
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,480
what you've said that in the uh in the

471
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,799
soviet union

472
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,879
that idea is really different now the

473
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,679
downside of that idea that anybody can

474
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,198
get there if you work hard

475
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,799
is

476
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,399
that thought that if you're not getting

477
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:28,719
there it's your fault

478
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,759
and i i would add something into that i

479
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,360
would say that anybody can get there

480
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,120
but they they need to work hard and they

481
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,360
also need good teaching

482
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,399
because there are some people who really

483
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,278
can't get there because they're not

484
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,159
given access to that good teaching

485
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,879
so

486
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:47,919
but that would be huge that change as to

487
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:50,320
doing lots of maths if um

488
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,240
if maths was interesting and open and

489
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,680
creative and multi-dimensional i would

490
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,519
be all for it

491
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,838
we we actually run summer camps at

492
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,639
stanford where we invite kids in and we

493
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:01,440
give them this maths that i love

494
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,360
and

495
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,279
the in our camp classrooms they were

496
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,318
three hours long

497
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,240
and

498
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,078
when we were planning the teachers were

499
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,400
like three hours are we gonna be able to

500
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,798
keep the kids excited for three hours

501
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,679
turned out they didn't want to go to

502
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,359
break or lunch they'd be so into these

503
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,240
mathematical patterns

504
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,318
we couldn't stop them it was

505
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,599
amazing so yeah if maths was more like

506
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:29,759
that then i think having more of it

507
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,279
would be a really good thing so what uh

508
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:34,640
what age are you talking about is there

509
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:38,160
um could you comment on what age

510
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,120
is like the most important when people

511
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,798
quit math or give up on themselves or on

512
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:45,038
math in general

513
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:46,720
and perhaps that age or something

514
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:48,640
earlier is really

515
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,480
important moment for them to discover to

516
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,360
be inspired to discover the magic of

517
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,200
math

518
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,119
i think a lot of kids start to give up

519
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,440
on themselves and

520
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:59,119
maths around

521
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,640
from about fifth grade

522
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,319
and then those middle school years are

523
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,480
really important

524
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,079
and fifth grade can be pivotal for kids

525
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,798
just because

526
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:10,480
they're allowed to explore and

527
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:12,160
think in good ways

528
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,440
in the early grades of elementary school

529
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,798
but fifth grade teachers are often like

530
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,400
okay we're going to prepare you now for

531
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,480
middle school and we're going to give

532
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,960
you grades and lots of tests and that's

533
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,200
when kids start to

534
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,440
feel really badly about themselves and

535
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,679
so middle school years we our camps are

536
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,240
middle school students we think of those

537
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,880
years as really pivotal many kids in in

538
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,519
those years are deciding yes i'm gonna

539
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,320
keep going with stem subjects

540
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:41,279
or no i'm not that this isn't for me

541
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,038
so i mean all years are important and in

542
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,558
all years you can kind of switch kids

543
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,240
and get them

544
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,319
on a different pathway but i think those

545
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,160
middle school years are really important

546
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,480
so what's the role of the teacher in

547
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,160
this so one is the explanation of the

548
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,599
subject but

549
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,240
do you think teachers

550
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:59,119
should almost do like one-on-one

551
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,440
you know

552
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,839
little johnny i believe in you kind of

553
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,519
thing like yeah that energy of like

554
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,839
turns out it's really important there's

555
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:10,319
um a study that was done it was actually

556
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,918
done in high school english classrooms

557
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:13,918
where all kids

558
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,080
wrote an essay for their teacher

559
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,160
and this was done as an experiment

560
00:19:16,079 --> 00:19:20,159
half of the kids got feedback from their

561
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,160
teacher diagnostic feedback which is

562
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,080
great but for half of the kids it said

563
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,160
an extra sentence at the bottom that the

564
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:29,038
researchers had put on

565
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:31,600
and the kids who read that extra

566
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,079
sentence did significantly better in

567
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,199
english a whole year later the only

568
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:37,038
change

569
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,600
was this one sentence what are the

570
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:42,319
sentences so what did the sentence say

571
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:45,119
the sentence said i'm giving you this

572
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:47,359
feedback because i believe in you

573
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,439
and the kids who read that did better a

574
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,798
year later yeah

575
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,640
so

576
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:54,240
when i share this with teachers i say

577
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,400
you know i'm not suggesting you put on

578
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,319
the bottom of all kids work and giving

579
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,679
this feedback i believe in you

580
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:02,000
one of the teachers said to me we don't

581
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:05,120
put it on a stamp i said no

582
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,720
don't put it on a stamp it's um

583
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:10,719
but your words are really important and

584
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,400
kids are sitting in classrooms all the

585
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,159
time thinking

586
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,240
what does my teacher think of me does my

587
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,280
teacher think i can do this

588
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,440
um

589
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,279
so it turns out it is really important

590
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,558
to be saying to kids i know you can do

591
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:23,759
this

592
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,720
and

593
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:29,119
those messages are not given enough by

594
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,720
teachers and really believe it and

595
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:33,119
believe it yeah it's like you can't just

596
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,159
say it you have to believe it i i

597
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,158
sometimes cause like

598
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:40,558
it's such a funny dance because i'm such

599
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,480
a perfectionist i'm extremely

600
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,879
self-critical and i have when students

601
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,798
come up to me and it's clear to me that

602
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,520
they're

603
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:52,240
not even close to good

604
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:54,480
and it's tempting for me to be like uh

605
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,960
to sort of give up on them mentally but

606
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,960
the reality is like if you look at many

607
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,038
great people throughout history

608
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,038
they sucked at some point yeah exactly

609
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:05,200
and and some of the greatest took

610
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:09,119
non-linear paths to where they sucked

611
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,720
for long into la into later life and so

612
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:14,399
always kind of believing that this

613
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:16,159
person uh can be great exactly

614
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,840
you have to communicate that plus the

615
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,960
fact that they have to work hard that's

616
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:20,720
it yeah

617
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,880
yeah and you're right silicon valley

618
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,440
where i live is filled with people who

619
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,400
are dropouts at school or who had

620
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,558
special needs who didn't succeed

621
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,159
um it's very interesting that have gone

622
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:36,000
on to do amazing work in creative ways

623
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,679
i mean i do think our school system is

624
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,079
set up to

625
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,120
um value

626
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,720
good memorizers who can reproduce what a

627
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:47,918
teacher is showing them

628
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:49,200
and push away those creative deep

629
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,480
thinkers

630
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,558
often

631
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:55,120
slower thinkers they think slowly and

632
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:57,279
deeply and they often get the idea early

633
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,038
on that they can't be good at maths or

634
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,918
other subjects

635
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,400
so

636
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,120
um yeah i think many of those people are

637
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,798
the ones who go on and do amazing things

638
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,719
so there's a guy

639
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,119
named eric weinstein i know many

640
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,919
mathematicians like this but he

641
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,158
he talks a lot about not having us

642
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,600
about having a non-standard way of

643
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,679
learning

644
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:22,079
i mean a lot of great mathematicians a

645
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,880
lot of great physicists are like that

646
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,480
and he felt like he became quickly he

647
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,480
got his phd at harvard

648
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,679
became quickly an outcast of the system

649
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,839
like the

650
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:34,720
the education especially early education

651
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,079
system didn't help them

652
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,440
is there

653
00:22:36,079 --> 00:22:41,119
ways for an education system to support

654
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,558
people like that is it this kind of

655
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:45,199
multi-dimensional learning that you're

656
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,918
missing absolutely i mean i think our

657
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,440
education system still uses an approach

658
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,240
that was in classrooms hundreds of years

659
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,919
ago

660
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,759
the textbooks

661
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,320
have a lot to answer for

662
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,679
in producing this very uninspiring

663
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:00,639
mathematics

664
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,480
um but yeah if you open up the subject

665
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,480
and have people see and solve it in

666
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,360
different ways and value those different

667
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,440
ways

668
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:09,918
somebody i appreciate it a lot is a

669
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,440
mathematician called marion miz akani

670
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,400
you heard of her she

671
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,840
won the fields medal she was from iran

672
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,000
first woman in the world to win the

673
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:21,199
fields medal in mathematics she's she

674
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,798
died when she was 40 she was at stanford

675
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:26,080
but her work was entirely visual

676
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:27,519
and

677
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:29,199
she talked about how her daughter

678
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,679
thought she was an artist because she

679
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,798
was always visualizing and

680
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,280
i

681
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:37,359
attended she asked me to chair the phd

682
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:39,599
defense for one of her students

683
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,439
and i went to the defense in the math

684
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,558
department and it was so interesting

685
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,360
because

686
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:47,759
this young woman spent like two hours

687
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,599
sharing her work all of it was visual in

688
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,839
fact i don't think i saw any numbers at

689
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,319
all it's awesome and

690
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:56,079
i remember that day thinking wow i could

691
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,519
have brought her like 13 year old into

692
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,240
this phd defense they would not

693
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:01,200
recognize this as maths

694
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,278
but

695
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,880
when mary and ms kearney won the fields

696
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,839
medal all these other mathematicians

697
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,840
were saying that her work had connected

698
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:11,199
all these previously unconnected areas

699
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:12,079
of maths

700
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,960
and

701
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,038
so

702
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,400
but when she was she also shared that

703
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:19,759
when she was in school when she was

704
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,960
about 13 she was told that she couldn't

705
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:22,960
do maths

706
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,200
she was told that by her teacher is this

707
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,000
is iran

708
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,000
yeah

709
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,759
so i love that you know to be told you

710
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,599
can't be good at maths and then go on

711
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,558
and win the fields medal

712
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:33,839
is

713
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,720
cool

714
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:35,839
i've been

715
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,360
told

716
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,038
by a lot of people in my life that i

717
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:40,558
can't do something i'm very definitely

718
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,119
non-standard

719
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,639
um but all it takes is that's

720
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,158
that's why people talk about like the

721
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,919
one teacher that changed everything

722
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,919
exactly all it takes is one teacher

723
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,080
that's right that's that's the power of

724
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,080
that

725
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,519
so that that's like that should be

726
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:59,120
inspiring to teachers like i think it is

727
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:00,960
you as a single person given the

728
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:03,199
education system given the incentives

729
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,038
you have the power to truly change lives

730
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,640
in like 20 years from now that's right i

731
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:09,359
feel this medalist will walk up to you

732
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:11,520
and yeah thank you you did that for me

733
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:15,519
yeah absolutely and i share that with

734
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,319
teachers that even in this broken system

735
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:18,000
of

736
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,759
what they have to do for districts and

737
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,240
textbooks

738
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:24,960
a single teacher can change kids maths

739
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,480
relationship or other subjects and

740
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,480
forever

741
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,440
what's the role of the parents in this

742
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,519
picture

743
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,080
let's go to another difficult subject

744
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:36,879
yeah that is a difficult subject um

745
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:38,480
one study found that

746
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,720
um

747
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:44,720
the amount of maths anxiety parents had

748
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,720
predicted their child's achievement in

749
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,240
school

750
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,360
but

751
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,519
only if they helped with homework

752
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:53,519
so

753
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,720
that's so funny yeah

754
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,480
but there are some interesting

755
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,400
implications for this i mean you can see

756
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,360
how it works if you have maths anxiety

757
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,278
and you're helping your kids with

758
00:26:03,359 --> 00:26:06,399
homework you're probably communicating

759
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,038
things like

760
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:12,480
i was terrible at this at school and

761
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:13,519
and that's how it gets passed on to kids

762
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,839
so

763
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:17,200
one implication is if you have a really

764
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,399
bad relationship with maths you hate

765
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,840
maths you have math anxiety just don't

766
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,000
don't do math say well with your kids

767
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:27,199
um but we have a on our website we have

768
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,359
a little

769
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,440
sheet for parents of

770
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:32,558
ways to interact around maths with your

771
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,679
kids

772
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,399
and

773
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,200
that's uh

774
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,880
youtube.org that's youtube.org yes

775
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,278
so one of the things i say to parents

776
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:45,520
when i give parent presentations is even

777
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,400
if you hate maths you need to just fake

778
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,720
it with your kids you should be always

779
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,919
endlessly optimistic and happy about

780
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,000
doing maths and um

781
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,799
i'm always curious about this so i you

782
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,240
know

783
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:00,079
i hope to have kids one day i don't have

784
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:03,359
kids currently

785
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:05,119
um are parents okay with like sucking at

786
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,879
math and then

787
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,399
trying to get their kid to be better

788
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,159
than them essentially like is that

789
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,000
difficult thing for a lot of parents it

790
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,480
is difficult to have like it's almost

791
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,798
like an ego thing like i never got

792
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,399
good at this and i probably should have

793
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:20,000
and

794
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,239
yeah i mean to me this you want to

795
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,558
celebrate that but i know a lot of

796
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,839
people struggle with that like coaches

797
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,000
in sports

798
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,480
to to make an athlete

799
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,759
become better than them it can be hard

800
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,640
on the ego

801
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,398
yeah

802
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,880
so is that do you experience the same

803
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,398
with parents too i think i mean i

804
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,720
haven't experienced parents worrying

805
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:42,719
that their kids will be better than them

806
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:45,519
i have experienced

807
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,200
i have experienced parents

808
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,839
just having a really bad relationship

809
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,240
with maths and yeah you know not wanting

810
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,918
to help not knowing how to help

811
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,079
saying things

812
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,720
like another study showed that when

813
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,639
mothers say to their daughters i was bad

814
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,399
at maths in school their daughter's

815
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,080
achievement goes down

816
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,278
so we know that kids pick up on these

817
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:07,519
messages

818
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:09,839
and um which is why i say you should

819
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,119
fake it but also i know that lots of

820
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:13,439
people have just had a really bad

821
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:15,839
relationship with maths even

822
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,840
successful people like the

823
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,959
undergrads i teach at stanford have

824
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:24,079
pretty much always done well in maths

825
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:28,159
but they come to stanford thinking maths

826
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:29,678
is a set of methods to memorize

827
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,600
and so

828
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,320
so do many parents believe that there's

829
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:36,879
one method that you memorize

830
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:39,278
and then you reproduce it

831
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:41,120
so until people have really had an

832
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,359
experience of what i think of as the

833
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:44,479
other maths where until they've really

834
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,158
seen that it's a really different

835
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:48,399
subject

836
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,399
um

837
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,720
it's hard for them to be able to shift

838
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,960
their kids to see it differently is

839
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,000
there for a teacher

840
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,000
if we were to like systematize it is

841
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,720
there something teachers can do to do

842
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,359
this more effectively so you must you

843
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,440
mentioned the textbook yeah so so what

844
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:09,359
what are the additional things you can

845
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,080
add on top of this whole

846
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,719
old school traditional way of teaching

847
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:17,038
that can improve the the process

848
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,798
so i do think there's a way of teaching

849
00:29:17,038 --> 00:29:23,919
maths that changes everything for kids

850
00:29:20,798 --> 00:29:25,918
and teachers so i'm one of five writers

851
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,600
of a new framework for the state of

852
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,200
california new maths framework it's

853
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:31,278
coming out next year

854
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,960
and we are recommending through this

855
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:36,319
maths framework that people teach in

856
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,640
this way it's called teaching to

857
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:41,678
big ideas

858
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,520
so um at the moment people have

859
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,038
standards that have been written and

860
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:46,879
then textbooks have taken these

861
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,720
standards and made

862
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,640
not very good questions

863
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,960
and if you look at the standards like i

864
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,440
have some written down here

865
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,919
just reading the standards it makes math

866
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,759
seem really boring and uninspiring what

867
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,600
what what are the kind of can you give a

868
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:03,599
few examples what so

869
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:05,199
this is an interesting example in third

870
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:09,798
grade there are three different

871
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,798
standards about unit squares

872
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:15,439
okay um so this is one of them a square

873
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,919
with side length one unit called a unit

874
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,480
square is said to have one square unit

875
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:22,399
of area and can be used to measure area

876
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,360
and that's something you're expected to

877
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:24,798
learn

878
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,038
that is something that so that's a

879
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:28,480
standard the textbook authors say oh i'm

880
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,798
going to make a question about that and

881
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,000
they translate the standards into narrow

882
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:33,519
questions

883
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,880
and then you measure success by your

884
00:30:33,519 --> 00:30:39,440
ability to deliver on on these standards

885
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,360
so the standards themselves uh i think

886
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,600
of maths and many people think maths in

887
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,240
this way is a subject of like a few big

888
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,839
ideas and really important connections

889
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,440
between them

890
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,558
um so like you could think of it as like

891
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,880
a network map of ideas and connections

892
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:57,119
and what standards do is they take that

893
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,880
beautiful map and they chop it up like

894
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,759
this into lots of little pieces and they

895
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,240
deliver the pieces to schools and

896
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:06,720
so teachers don't see the connections

897
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,319
between ideas nor do the kids so anyway

898
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,558
this is a bit of a long way of saying

899
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:11,839
that what we've done in this new

900
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:15,038
initiative

901
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:16,000
is we have set out maths as a set of big

902
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:18,158
ideas

903
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,359
and connections between them so this is

904
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,799
a

905
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,798
grade three

906
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:25,038
so instead of there being

907
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:26,240
60 standards

908
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:28,079
we've said

909
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,720
well you can

910
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:33,278
pull these different standards to get in

911
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,720
with each other and

912
00:31:33,278 --> 00:31:37,919
um

913
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,360
also value the ways these are connected

914
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,519
and by the way for people who are just

915
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,240
listening we're looking at a small

916
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,440
number of uh like big concepts within

917
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,919
mathematics

918
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:48,960
square towels measuring fraction shape

919
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:51,600
and time

920
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:53,600
and then how they're interconnected

921
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,918
and so the goal is for this is for grade

922
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:58,158
three for example yeah

923
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,919
and so we've set out for the state of

924
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:05,120
california the whole of mathematics k

925
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,919
10 as a set of big ideas and connections

926
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,079
so

927
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,960
we know that teachers it works really

928
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:12,480
well if they say okay so a big idea in

929
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,278
my grade

930
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,440
is

931
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:18,159
measuring

932
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,720
and instead of reading five procedural

933
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,559
statements that involve measuring

934
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:25,839
they think okay measuring is a big idea

935
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:28,398
what rich deep activity can i use that

936
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:30,639
teaches measuring to kids and as kids

937
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,558
work on these deep rich activities maybe

938
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,840
over a few days

939
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:36,639
turns out a lot of maths comes into it

940
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,599
so

941
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,360
we're recommending that let's not teach

942
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,278
maths according to all these multiple

943
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,519
multiple statements

944
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:47,759
and lots and lots of short questions

945
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,599
instead let's teach maths by thinking

946
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,240
about what are the big ideas and what

947
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:54,719
are really rich deep activities that

948
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:57,440
teach those big ideas so that's the like

949
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,000
how you teach it and maximize learning

950
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,600
what about like from a school district

951
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,119
perspective

952
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:05,278
like measuring

953
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,119
how well you're doing you know grades

954
00:33:05,278 --> 00:33:10,240
and tests and stuff like that do you

955
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:13,359
throw those out or is there is not a fan

956
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,640
of grades and tests um myself

957
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:17,519
i think

958
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,960
grades are fine if they're used at the

959
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,200
end of a course

960
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,120
so at the end of my maths course i might

961
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:24,640
get a grade because a grade is meant to

962
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:26,158
be a summative measure it kind of

963
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,480
describes your

964
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,720
summit of achievement but the problem we

965
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,360
have in maths classrooms across the uh

966
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,319
the us is people use grades all the time

967
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,158
every week or every day even

968
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:39,678
my own kids when they went through high

969
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,679
school technology has not helped with

970
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,440
this when they went through high school

971
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,840
they knew they had been graded for

972
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:47,759
everything they did everything

973
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:49,119
and not only were they being graded for

974
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,440
everything but they could see it in the

975
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:53,678
grade book online and it would alter

976
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,759
every class they went into so

977
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,000
this is the ultimate what i think of as

978
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,640
a performance culture you're there to

979
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,398
perform somebody's measuring you you see

980
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,600
your score

981
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,959
um

982
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:08,559
so i think that's not conducive for

983
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,639
deep learning

984
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:13,119
and yes have a grade at the end of the

985
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,240
year but during the year you can assess

986
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,358
kids in much better ways like teachers

987
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:19,199
can

988
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:20,878
a great way of assessing kids is to give

989
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,319
them a rubric

990
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,559
that kind of outlines what they're

991
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,760
learning over the course of a unit or a

992
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:28,239
few weeks

993
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,679
so kids can actually see the journey

994
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,118
they're on like this is what we're doing

995
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:33,280
mathematically

996
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,720
sometimes they self-assess on those

997
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,119
units and then teachers

998
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:41,519
um will show where what they can what

999
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,119
the kids can do with a rubric and also

1000
00:34:41,519 --> 00:34:45,440
write notes like you know in the next

1001
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:46,879
few weeks you might like to learn to do

1002
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,519
this so

1003
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:51,679
um so instead of kids just thinking

1004
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,358
about i'm an a kid or a b kid or i have

1005
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,599
this letter attached to me they're

1006
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:56,878
actually seeing mathematically what's

1007
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,599
important

1008
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:02,239
and they're involved in the process of

1009
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,079
knowing where they are mathematically

1010
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,319
at the end of the year sure they can

1011
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,079
have a grade but um during the year they

1012
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,079
get these much more informative measures

1013
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,640
i do think

1014
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,400
this this might be more for college

1015
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,799
but maybe not i

1016
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,760
some of the best classes i've had is

1017
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,519
when

1018
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,680
i got a special

1019
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:25,920
like set aside

1020
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:27,919
like the the professor

1021
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,119
clearly saw that i was interested in

1022
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,639
some aspect of a thing and then um i

1023
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,960
have a few in mind and one in particular

1024
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:38,400
but he said that um

1025
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,159
he kind of challenged me so this is

1026
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,358
outside of grades and all that that kind

1027
00:35:40,159 --> 00:35:43,118
of stuff

1028
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,960
that

1029
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,200
basically it's like reverse psychology i

1030
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,240
don't i don't think this can be done

1031
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,000
and so i gave everything to do that

1032
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,399
particular thing so this was happened to

1033
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,440
be in an artificial intelligence class

1034
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,838
but

1035
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,679
i i think that like special treatment of

1036
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,078
taking students

1037
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,919
who are especially like excellent at a

1038
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,079
particular little aspect that you see

1039
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,800
their eyes light up

1040
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,240
i i often think like maybe it's tempting

1041
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,320
for a teacher to think you've already

1042
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:14,239
succeeded there but they're actually

1043
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,400
signaling to you that

1044
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:19,279
like you could really launch them on

1045
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,039
their way yeah um and

1046
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,680
i don't know that's too much to expect

1047
00:36:21,039 --> 00:36:24,960
from teachers i think to to to

1048
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,199
pay attention to all of that because

1049
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,920
it's really difficult but i i just kind

1050
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:32,319
of remember who are the biggest

1051
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,039
the most important people in the history

1052
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,359
of

1053
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:37,279
my life of education and it's those

1054
00:36:35,358 --> 00:36:39,119
people that who really

1055
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,440
didn't just like inspire me with their

1056
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,200
awesomeness which they did but also just

1057
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,119
they pushed me a little yeah like it

1058
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,039
gave me a little push

1059
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,880
and that requires focusing on the quote

1060
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,679
unquote excellent

1061
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,160
uh yes in the class yeah i think what's

1062
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,319
important though is teachers to have the

1063
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:58,399
perspective that they don't know who's

1064
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,160
going to be excellent at something

1065
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,000
before they give out the activity

1066
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:05,679
exactly and in our camp classes that we

1067
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,639
ran

1068
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:10,319
sometimes students would finish ahead of

1069
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:12,480
other students

1070
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,240
and we would say to them

1071
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,159
can you

1072
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:17,519
write a question that's like this but

1073
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,960
different

1074
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,280
um

1075
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,639
oh and and over time we encourage them

1076
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,720
to like extend things further

1077
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:28,719
i remember we were doing one activity

1078
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:31,118
where kids were working at the borders

1079
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:33,439
of a square and how big this border

1080
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,440
would be in different case sizes

1081
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,358
and one of the boys came up

1082
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,639
at the end of the class and said

1083
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:40,319
i've been thinking about how you'd do

1084
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,799
this with a pentagon

1085
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,400
and i said that's fantastic how do you

1086
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,000
how what does it look like with pentagon

1087
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,200
go you know find out see if you can

1088
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,880
discover

1089
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:50,879
so i didn't know he was going to come up

1090
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:53,119
and say that and

1091
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,039
i didn't have in my head like this is

1092
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,800
the kid who could have this extension

1093
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:59,599
task but

1094
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,359
you can still do that as a teacher

1095
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,440
when kids get excited about something or

1096
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:06,000
they're doing well in something have

1097
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:08,400
them extend it go further

1098
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,280
it's great and then you also like this

1099
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,599
is like

1100
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,040
teacher and coach

1101
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:15,119
you could say it in different ways to

1102
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:17,039
different students like for me the right

1103
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,559
thing to say is uh

1104
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,400
almost to say

1105
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,559
uh i don't think you could do this this

1106
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,800
is too hard like that's what i need to

1107
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,880
hear it's just like no i you know you

1108
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,039
there's an immediate push but with some

1109
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,039
people if they're a little bit more

1110
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,119
i mean it all has to do with upbringing

1111
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:34,960
how your genetics is

1112
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,880
they might be much more that might break

1113
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,559
them yeah that might break them so you

1114
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,240
have to be also sensitive to that i mean

1115
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:43,279
teaching is really difficult it's really

1116
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:46,719
difficult for this very reason it is

1117
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,440
so um what is the best way

1118
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:51,519
to teach math to learn math at those

1119
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,679
early few days when you just want to

1120
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,599
capture them

1121
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,078
i do something actually there's a video

1122
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:01,599
of me doing this on our website

1123
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,119
that i love when i first

1124
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:05,280
meet students

1125
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:07,119
and this is what i do i show

1126
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,160
them a picture this is the picture i

1127
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,480
show them

1128
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:12,719
and it's a picture of seven dots like

1129
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,719
this

1130
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,639
and i show it for just a few seconds and

1131
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,160
i say to them i'd like you to tell me

1132
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:19,920
how many dots there are but i don't need

1133
00:39:18,159 --> 00:39:22,879
to count them i'm going to group the

1134
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:25,358
dots and i show it them and then i

1135
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,440
i i take it away before they've even had

1136
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:29,759
enough time to count them and then i

1137
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,440
asked them so how did you see it

1138
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,880
and i go around the room and

1139
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,039
amazingly enough

1140
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,200
there's probably 18 different ways of

1141
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,599
seeing these seven dots

1142
00:39:39,199 --> 00:39:43,199
and so i asked people tell me how how

1143
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,680
you grouped it and some people see it as

1144
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,919
like an outside hole with a center dot

1145
00:39:45,679 --> 00:39:49,199
some people see like stripes

1146
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:51,680
of lines

1147
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:53,199
some people see segments

1148
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:54,799
and i collect them all and i put them on

1149
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,439
the board and at the end i say look at

1150
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,599
this we are a class of 30 kids and we

1151
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,280
saw these seven dots in 18 different

1152
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,838
ways there's actually a mathematical

1153
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,000
term for this it's called groupitizing

1154
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,318
groupitizing yeah

1155
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,639
i like it it's kind of cool so

1156
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,440
turns out though that how well you

1157
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:15,440
groupitize predicts

1158
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:18,400
how well you do in maths

1159
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,519
is is it uh is it a raw talent or is it

1160
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,200
just something that you can develop i

1161
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:23,440
think it's i don't think you're born

1162
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:25,279
groupitizing i think but some kids have

1163
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,920
developed that

1164
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,160
um ability if you like and you can learn

1165
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,599
it you can so

1166
00:40:30,159 --> 00:40:35,759
this to me is part of how wrong we have

1167
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,960
maths that we think to tell whether a

1168
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,960
kid's good at maths we're going to give

1169
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,159
them a speed test on

1170
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,318
fact on multiples but actually

1171
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:47,039
seeing how kids group dots could be a

1172
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:48,960
more important assessment of how well

1173
00:40:47,039 --> 00:40:51,358
they're going to do maths anyway i

1174
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,280
diverge what i like to do though when i

1175
00:40:51,358 --> 00:40:54,559
start off with kids is show them i'm

1176
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,000
going to give you math problems i'm

1177
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,039
going to value the different ways you

1178
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,159
see them

1179
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:59,358
and

1180
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,039
turns out you can do this kind of

1181
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,920
problem asking people how they group

1182
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:06,639
dots with young children or with

1183
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,519
graduate students and it's

1184
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:11,838
engaging for all of them

1185
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,599
is uh you talk about creativity a little

1186
00:41:11,838 --> 00:41:15,838
bit and flexibility

1187
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,920
in your book limitless what's the role

1188
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,039
of that so it sounds like there's a bit

1189
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,599
of that

1190
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,519
kind of thing involved in

1191
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,559
grupotizing yeah

1192
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,400
yeah i love this term so what's what

1193
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:30,559
would you say is the role of creativity

1194
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,920
and flexibility in in the learning of

1195
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:35,920
math i think what we know now is that

1196
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,960
what we need for this

1197
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,680
21st century world we live in

1198
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:43,519
is a flexible mind

1199
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:45,598
it's school should not really be about

1200
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:46,960
teaching kids particular methods but

1201
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,440
teaching them to

1202
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:51,280
approach problems with flexibility

1203
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,800
being creative thinking creatively is

1204
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,599
really important

1205
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,560
so people don't think the words maths

1206
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,480
and creativity come together but i

1207
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,799
that's what i love about maths is the

1208
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,000
creative different ways you can see it

1209
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,519
and so helping our kids

1210
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,880
there's a book

1211
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:12,079
i like a lot but i've been by physicists

1212
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,920
you probably know this book could

1213
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:15,680
elastic

1214
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,400
you might know it um

1215
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:20,159
and it's about how we want elastic minds

1216
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,440
same kind of thing flexible creative

1217
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:22,719
minds

1218
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,079
and

1219
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,159
schools

1220
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:28,318
do very little on developing that kind

1221
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:32,159
of mind they do a lot

1222
00:42:28,318 --> 00:42:33,838
of developing the kind of mind that a

1223
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:35,199
computer now

1224
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,239
does for us

1225
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:40,399
memorization memorization

1226
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:42,799
doing procedures

1227
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,280
a lot of things that we spend a lot of

1228
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,519
time in school on

1229
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,519
in the world when kids leave school a

1230
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,480
computer will do that

1231
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,480
and

1232
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,719
better than they will

1233
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:55,760
but that creative flexible thinking

1234
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:57,598
we're kind of

1235
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:59,359
ground zero at computers being able to

1236
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,880
engage in that thinking

1237
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:05,199
maybe we're a little above ground zero

1238
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,119
but um the human brain is perfectly

1239
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,799
suited for that creative flexible

1240
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,838
thinking that's what humans are so great

1241
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,519
at

1242
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,440
so i would like the balance to shift in

1243
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:15,838
schools maybe you still need to do some

1244
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,599
procedural kind of thinking but there

1245
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,159
should be a lot more of that creative

1246
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,039
flexible thinking

1247
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:24,838
and uh what's the role of other humans

1248
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,480
in this picture so

1249
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:29,358
collaborative

1250
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,400
yeah learning so brainstorming together

1251
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:34,239
so creativity as it emerges from

1252
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,680
the collective intelligence of multiple

1253
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,199
humans yeah

1254
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,159
super important and

1255
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,960
um we know that also helps develop your

1256
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,039
brain that social side of thinking and i

1257
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,440
love mathematics collaboration where

1258
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:49,759
people build on each other's ideas

1259
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:52,079
and they come up with amazing things i

1260
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:56,079
actually taught a hundred

1261
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,760
students calculus at stanford recently

1262
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:59,920
undergrads and

1263
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,680
we taught them to collaborate so these

1264
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,000
students came into stanford and most of

1265
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,679
them were against collaboration

1266
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,000
in maths this is before covered in

1267
00:44:05,679 --> 00:44:10,239
person yeah it was just before covert

1268
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,239
hit it was 2019.

1269
00:44:10,239 --> 00:44:15,838
and um

1270
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:18,000
you said they're against uh so yeah so

1271
00:44:15,838 --> 00:44:20,318
it's really interesting so they'd only

1272
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,159
experience maths individually as in a

1273
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:24,559
kind of competitive individual way and

1274
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,960
if they had experienced it as group work

1275
00:44:24,559 --> 00:44:29,039
it had been a bad experience like maybe

1276
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,480
they were the one who did it all and the

1277
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,480
others didn't

1278
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:34,079
do much so they were kind of against

1279
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,480
collaboration they didn't see any role

1280
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,318
for it in maths and we taught them to

1281
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,880
collaborate

1282
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,480
and it was hard work because

1283
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,920
as well as the fact that they were kind

1284
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,440
of against collaboration they came in

1285
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,358
with a lot of like

1286
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,400
social comparison

1287
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:50,880
thinking

1288
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:53,440
so i'm in this room with other stanford

1289
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:54,960
undergrads and they're better than me or

1290
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,400
so when we send them to work on a maths

1291
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,400
problem together the first one was kind

1292
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,760
of a disaster because they were all like

1293
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,280
they're better than me they're faster

1294
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,560
than me they came up with something i

1295
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:04,720
didn't come up with

1296
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,880
so we taught them

1297
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:08,480
to let go of that thinking and to work

1298
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,640
well together

1299
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:12,480
and one of the things we did we decided

1300
00:45:10,639 --> 00:45:14,400
we wanted to do a pre and post test at

1301
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,639
the end of this teaching it was only

1302
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,400
four weeks long but we knew we didn't

1303
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,960
want to give them like a timed test of

1304
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,400
individual work so we gave them

1305
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,519
an applied problem to do at the

1306
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,079
beginning

1307
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,358
and we gave them to do in pairs together

1308
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:30,000
and we gave each of them a different

1309
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:32,000
colored pen and said work on this

1310
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,880
activity together and keep using that

1311
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,639
pen

1312
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,720
so then we had all these pieces of

1313
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:39,679
student work and what we saw was they

1314
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:41,919
just were on separate parts of the paper

1315
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,598
uh so this little like red pen section

1316
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,838
and a green pen section

1317
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,599
and they didn't do that well on it

1318
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:49,358
even though it was a

1319
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,400
problem that middle or high school kids

1320
00:45:49,358 --> 00:45:52,559
could do but it was like a

1321
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,318
problem-solving kind of problem

1322
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:56,318
and then we gave them the same one to do

1323
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:58,000
at the end gave them the same colors and

1324
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,239
it actually they had learned to

1325
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,159
collaborate and not only were they

1326
00:46:00,239 --> 00:46:04,159
collaborating the second time around but

1327
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:06,480
that boosted their achievement and the

1328
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:07,759
ones who collaborated did better on the

1329
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,079
problem

1330
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,920
collaboration is important having people

1331
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,079
and what was so eye-opening for these

1332
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,318
undergrads and they talked about it in

1333
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,480
lovely ways was

1334
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,719
i learned to value other people's

1335
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,719
thinking on a problem and i learned to

1336
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:24,239
value that other people saw it in

1337
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,519
different ways

1338
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,519
and

1339
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,358
it was quite a

1340
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:31,679
big experience for them

1341
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:33,759
that they came out thinking you know i

1342
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:35,440
can do maths with other people people

1343
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,960
can see it differently we can build on

1344
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,440
each other's way

1345
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,559
ways of thinking i got a chance to i

1346
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,838
don't know if you know who daniel

1347
00:46:40,559 --> 00:46:44,000
kahneman has

1348
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,480
got a chance to interact with him

1349
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,679
and like the first because he had

1350
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,000
a few but

1351
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:51,039
one famous collaboration throughout his

1352
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:54,400
life

1353
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:55,599
uh with taversky and

1354
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:57,920
just like

1355
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,480
you know he hasn't met me before uh in

1356
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,039
person but just the number of questions

1357
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:05,440
he was asking just the curiosity

1358
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,838
so i think one of the skills

1359
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,318
the collaboration itself is a skill

1360
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:12,480
and i remember my experience with him

1361
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:14,000
was like okay i get why you're so good

1362
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,400
at collaboration

1363
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,880
because he was just extremely good at

1364
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:21,358
listening and genuine

1365
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,358
curiosity about how the other person

1366
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:25,838
thinks about the world sees the world

1367
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,440
and then together he's he pulled me in

1368
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:29,599
in that particular case

1369
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:31,440
he doesn't know in particular like that

1370
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,720
much about autonomous vehicles but he

1371
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,440
kept like

1372
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,279
asking all these questions and then like

1373
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,838
10 minutes in we're together trying to

1374
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,599
solve the problem of autonomous driving

1375
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:43,119
and like and that

1376
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,280
i mean that's really fulfilling that's

1377
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:47,280
really enriching but it also in that

1378
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,960
moment made me realize it's kind of a

1379
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,599
skill because you have to kind of put

1380
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:54,000
your ego aside yep put your view of the

1381
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,680
world aside and try to learn how the

1382
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,039
other person right

1383
00:47:55,679 --> 00:48:00,558
and the other thing you have to put

1384
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,838
aside is this social comparison thinking

1385
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:03,839
like if you

1386
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:05,759
are sitting there thinking wow that was

1387
00:48:03,838 --> 00:48:09,119
an amazing idea he's so much better than

1388
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:12,079
i am that's really gonna stop you

1389
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,160
taking on the value of that idea

1390
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:15,680
and so there's a lot of that going on

1391
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,358
between these stanford students when

1392
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:18,838
they came

1393
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:20,960
and

1394
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:21,759
yeah but trying to help them let go of

1395
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:24,240
that

1396
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,920
one of the things i've discovered

1397
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:27,358
just because being a little bit more in

1398
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,639
the public eye

1399
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:33,679
how rewarding it is to celebrate others

1400
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:36,000
yeah and how much is going to actually

1401
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:38,639
pay off in the long term yeah so this

1402
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,119
kind of silo thinking of like i want to

1403
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,118
prove to a small set of people around me

1404
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,000
that i'm really smart

1405
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,200
and

1406
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,920
do so

1407
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,598
by basically not celebrating how smart

1408
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,440
the other people are that's actually

1409
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:53,359
maybe short term

1410
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:55,200
it seems like a good strategy but long

1411
00:48:53,358 --> 00:48:56,719
term it's not and i think if you

1412
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,879
practice at the student level and then

1413
00:48:56,719 --> 00:49:00,959
at the career la at every single stage i

1414
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,318
think that's ultimately i i agree with

1415
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,318
you i think that's a really good way of

1416
00:49:02,318 --> 00:49:07,199
thinking about it

1417
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:08,960
you mentioned textbooks you said and you

1418
00:49:07,199 --> 00:49:10,159
didn't say it

1419
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,199
you know

1420
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:13,838
um

1421
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:16,879
maybe textbooks isn't the perfect way to

1422
00:49:13,838 --> 00:49:18,558
teach mathematics but i i love textbooks

1423
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,160
there's they're like pretty pictures and

1424
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,160
they smell nice and they open i mean i

1425
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:24,078
talk about like physical some of my

1426
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,799
greatest experiences have been just like

1427
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:27,200
oh

1428
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,440
like because they're really well done

1429
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,480
when we're talking about basic like high

1430
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,639
school

1431
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:35,039
calculus

1432
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,719
biology chemistry those are like those

1433
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:39,199
are incredible

1434
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:41,039
it's like wikipedia but with color and

1435
00:49:39,199 --> 00:49:42,960
and nice little you must have seen some

1436
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:44,558
good textbooks if they had pretty

1437
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,880
pictures in color

1438
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,040
yeah i mean i remember i guess it was

1439
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,160
very very standard

1440
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:53,599
like ap

1441
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:55,199
ap calculus ap biology ap chemistry i

1442
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,039
felt those are like some of the happiest

1443
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:59,358
days of my life in terms of learning was

1444
00:49:57,039 --> 00:50:01,920
high school because it was it's very

1445
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,920
easy honestly

1446
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:05,920
it felt hard at the time but you're

1447
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,039
basically doing a um

1448
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,680
whirlwind tour of all of science yeah

1449
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,920
yeah without having to pick you do

1450
00:50:11,679 --> 00:50:17,598
literature you do like shakespeare your

1451
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:20,240
calculus biology physics

1452
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:22,000
chemistry what else anatomy

1453
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,639
physiology

1454
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,639
computer science without like nobody's

1455
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,000
telling you what to do with your life

1456
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:29,920
you're just doing all those things

1457
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:32,318
that's a good thing you're right but i

1458
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,280
remember the textbooks weren't

1459
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:35,519
i mean

1460
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,280
maybe i'm romanticizing the past but i

1461
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:38,159
remember they weren't they're pretty

1462
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,079
good

1463
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:41,920
um but so you think what role do you

1464
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,400
think they play still

1465
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,039
and like in this more modern

1466
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:48,800
digital age what what's the best

1467
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,358
materials with which to do these kinds

1468
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:52,880
of educations well i'm intrigued that

1469
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,960
you have such a good experience with

1470
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:57,039
textbooks i mean i can

1471
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:59,519
remember loving some textbooks i had

1472
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:01,838
when i was learning and i love books i

1473
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:03,039
love to pick up books and look through

1474
00:51:01,838 --> 00:51:04,880
them

1475
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:07,519
but

1476
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,760
a lot of maths textbooks are not good

1477
00:51:07,519 --> 00:51:10,800
experiences for kids they

1478
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,960
um

1479
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,559
we have a video on our website of the

1480
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,480
kids who came to our camp and one of the

1481
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:18,720
students says

1482
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:20,639
in maths you have to follow the textbook

1483
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:22,399
the textbooks kind of like the bible you

1484
00:51:20,639 --> 00:51:23,358
have to follow it

1485
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,720
and

1486
00:51:23,358 --> 00:51:26,558
every day

1487
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:28,719
it's slightly different like on monday

1488
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,359
you do 2.3.2

1489
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:32,480
and on tuesday you do 2.3.3 and on

1490
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:33,440
wednesday

1491
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:36,000
and

1492
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:37,838
you never go off that that's like every

1493
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:39,039
single day

1494
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:41,358
and

1495
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:43,599
that's not inspiring for

1496
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:45,039
a lot of the kids

1497
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,160
so one of the things they loved about

1498
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,960
our camp was just that there were no

1499
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:50,639
books even though we gave them

1500
00:51:48,960 --> 00:51:53,199
sheets of paper instead

1501
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:55,118
they still felt more free

1502
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:58,078
because they weren't just like trotting

1503
00:51:55,119 --> 00:52:01,440
through exercises exercises

1504
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,440
so um like what a textbook allows you is

1505
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:05,920
like you're

1506
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:08,318
the the very thing you said they might

1507
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:10,159
not like the two point yeah point three

1508
00:52:08,318 --> 00:52:11,920
two point if you feels like you're

1509
00:52:10,159 --> 00:52:14,799
making progress and like it's little

1510
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,480
celebrations because you do the problem

1511
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,400
and it seems really hard and you don't

1512
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,800
know how to do it and then you

1513
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:22,639
try and try and then eventually succeed

1514
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,200
then you make that little step and yeah

1515
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:27,118
further progress and then you get to the

1516
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,799
end of a chapter and you get to like

1517
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,160
it's closure you're like yeah all right

1518
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,240
i got that figured out and then you go

1519
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:33,519
on to the next chapter i can see that i

1520
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:36,558
mean i think

1521
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:38,880
it could be in a textbook you can have

1522
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,800
a good experience with a textbook

1523
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:43,119
but it what's really important is what

1524
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,640
is what is in that textbook

1525
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:49,358
what are you doing inside it and i mean

1526
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:51,440
i grew up in england and in england we

1527
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:54,318
learn maths we don't have this

1528
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,000
separation of algebra and geometry

1529
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:58,159
and i don't think any other country

1530
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,119
apart from the us has that

1531
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:01,279
but

1532
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:02,960
i look at kids in algebra classes where

1533
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,119
they're doing algebra for a year and i

1534
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,440
think i would have been pretty bored

1535
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,318
doing that

1536
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,039
um

1537
00:53:08,318 --> 00:53:13,358
by the way can we can we analyze your

1538
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:14,480
upbringing real quick um

1539
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,440
why

1540
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,920
do british folks call

1541
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:22,079
mathematics maths

1542
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,358
why is it the plural is it is it because

1543
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,480
of everything you're saying where it's a

1544
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:29,759
bunch of sub-disciplines yeah i mean

1545
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:30,639
mathematics is sure is supposed to be

1546
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:31,680
the

1547
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:33,920
uh

1548
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,039
the map the different maths that you

1549
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,079
look at

1550
00:53:35,039 --> 00:53:40,800
whether you think of that as topics like

1551
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,760
geometry and probability or

1552
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,599
or

1553
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:45,440
i think of it as

1554
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,720
maths is just multi-dimensional lots of

1555
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,720
ways but

1556
00:53:46,719 --> 00:53:51,519
that's why it was called mathematics and

1557
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:52,959
then it was shortened to maths and then

1558
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:54,318
for some reason it was just math in the

1559
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:57,838
us but

1560
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:59,759
to me math has that more singular feel

1561
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:01,759
to it and

1562
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,880
there's an expression here which is do

1563
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,040
the math

1564
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,519
which basically means do a calculation

1565
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:09,920
that's what people mean by do the math

1566
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:11,358
so i don't like that expression because

1567
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,358
no math could be anything it doesn't

1568
00:54:11,358 --> 00:54:15,279
have to be calculation and

1569
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:17,598
so yeah i like maths because it has more

1570
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,119
of that broad feel to it yeah i love

1571
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,800
that maths kind of emphasizes the

1572
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:22,800
multi-dimensional like yeah variety of

1573
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,280
different different disciplines

1574
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:28,000
different approaches yeah

1575
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:30,800
okay uh what so but outside of the

1576
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:33,679
textbook what do you

1577
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:36,798
see like broadly being used you

1578
00:54:33,679 --> 00:54:38,639
mentioned sebastian through and moocs

1579
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:40,798
online education do you think that's an

1580
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:42,960
effective so can be

1581
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:45,920
i mean online

1582
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,599
having great teachers online obviously

1583
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,318
extends those teachers to many more

1584
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:51,359
people and that's a wonderful thing

1585
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:52,400
um

1586
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:54,558
i have

1587
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,559
quite a few online courses myself i got

1588
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:57,440
the bug working with sebastian when he

1589
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,760
was

1590
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,240
had released his first mooc

1591
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,160
and i thought maybe i could do one in

1592
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:06,798
maths education and i didn't know if

1593
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:08,558
anybody would take it um i remember

1594
00:55:06,798 --> 00:55:10,559
releasing it that first summer and it

1595
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:12,960
was a free online class and

1596
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:15,200
30 000 maths teachers took it that first

1597
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:17,039
summer and they were all talking about

1598
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:19,039
it with each other and sharing it and it

1599
00:55:17,039 --> 00:55:21,599
was like took off in fact

1600
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,880
it was that mooc that caught

1601
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:26,000
got me to

1602
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:28,559
create you cubed with kathy williams

1603
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,039
who's the co-founder um because people

1604
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,160
took the mooc and then they said okay

1605
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:35,279
what now

1606
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:36,798
i finished what what can i have next and

1607
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,920
so that was where we made our website

1608
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:40,079
but

1609
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:43,920
um so yeah i think online education can

1610
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:46,079
be great i do think a lot of the moocs

1611
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,519
don't have great pedagogy they're just a

1612
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:49,680
talking head

1613
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:51,599
and

1614
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,798
it you can actually engage people in

1615
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:57,599
more active ways even in online learning

1616
00:55:54,798 --> 00:56:00,079
so i learned from the udacity principle

1617
00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:02,880
when i was working udacity never to talk

1618
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:05,760
more than like five minutes and but then

1619
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,960
and then to ask people to do something

1620
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,640
so

1621
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,159
that's the sort of pedagogy of the

1622
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:11,598
online classes i have there's a little

1623
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:13,039
bit of

1624
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,039
presenting something and then people do

1625
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:16,639
something and there's a little bit more

1626
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,119
because i think if you have a half hour

1627
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:20,798
video you just you know

1628
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,358
switch off and start doing other things

1629
00:56:20,798 --> 00:56:26,719
so the the way udaci did it is uh like

1630
00:56:23,358 --> 00:56:27,759
five ten minute like bit of

1631
00:56:26,719 --> 00:56:29,598
teaching

1632
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:31,200
and then with some visual stuff perhaps

1633
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:33,359
and then there's like a quiz then you

1634
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:34,798
answer a question yeah yeah now that

1635
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:37,039
that's that's yeah that's really

1636
00:56:34,798 --> 00:56:39,039
effective you mentioned youtube so

1637
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:42,159
what's the mission what's the goal you

1638
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:44,960
mentioned how it started but what's uh

1639
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:46,879
um yeah where are you at now and what do

1640
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:48,480
you what's your dream with it or what

1641
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:50,318
are the kind of things that people

1642
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:52,798
should go and check out on there

1643
00:56:50,318 --> 00:56:54,719
yeah we started you cubed i guess it was

1644
00:56:52,798 --> 00:56:57,358
about five years ago now and we've had

1645
00:56:54,719 --> 00:57:00,239
over 52 million visitors to the site so

1646
00:56:57,358 --> 00:57:02,000
i'm very happy about that and our goal

1647
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:05,039
is to share

1648
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,199
good ideas for teaching with

1649
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,199
teachers students parents

1650
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:11,199
in maths and to help

1651
00:57:09,199 --> 00:57:13,358
we have a sort of subgoal of erasing

1652
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:14,239
maths anxiety that's important to us but

1653
00:57:13,358 --> 00:57:15,920
also

1654
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,838
to share maths as this beautiful

1655
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,838
creative subject

1656
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:22,400
and um

1657
00:57:19,838 --> 00:57:25,119
it's been really great we have lessons

1658
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:27,440
on the site but one of the things one of

1659
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,960
the reasons i thought this was needed is

1660
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:31,119
there's a lot of knowledge in the

1661
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:32,639
academy about how to teach maths well

1662
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:35,440
loads and loads of

1663
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:38,239
research and journals and lots of things

1664
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,960
written up but teachers don't read it

1665
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:43,118
they they don't have access to it

1666
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,240
they're often behind pay walls

1667
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:45,920
they

1668
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:47,598
they're written in really inaccessible

1669
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,400
ways so people wouldn't want to read

1670
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:52,000
them or understand them so this i see is

1671
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,680
a big problem you have this whole

1672
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,679
industry of people

1673
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:57,519
finding out how to teach well

1674
00:57:55,679 --> 00:57:58,798
not sharing it with the people who are

1675
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:59,519
teaching

1676
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:01,519
so

1677
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:03,280
um that's why we made youtube and

1678
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:04,719
instead of just putting articles up

1679
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,200
saying here's some things to read about

1680
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:09,199
how to teach well we translated what was

1681
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:11,519
coming from research into

1682
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:14,399
things that teacher could use so lessons

1683
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:16,400
there were videos to show kids and

1684
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,960
um there were tips for parents there

1685
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,480
were all sorts of things on the site and

1686
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,559
it's been amazing

1687
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:24,798
as we had we

1688
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,640
took inspiration from the week of code

1689
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:29,039
which

1690
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:31,279
got teachers to focus on coding for a

1691
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:33,759
week and um we have this thing called

1692
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,160
the week of inspirational maths

1693
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:38,160
and we say just try it for a week just

1694
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:39,279
just give us one week and try it and see

1695
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:42,239
what happens

1696
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,519
and so it's been downloaded millions of

1697
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:45,358
times teachers

1698
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:46,480
use it every year they start the school

1699
00:58:45,358 --> 00:58:49,440
year with it

1700
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:50,880
and what they tell us is it was amazing

1701
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,880
the kids lights were on they were

1702
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:54,880
excited they loved it

1703
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:56,798
and then the week finished and i opened

1704
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:58,880
my textbooks and the

1705
00:58:56,798 --> 00:58:59,920
lights went out and they were not

1706
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,079
interested

1707
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:04,240
yeah but uh but getting that first

1708
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:06,720
inspiration is still powerful i mean it

1709
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:08,719
is i i wish i mean my

1710
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:10,078
what i would love is if

1711
00:59:08,719 --> 00:59:11,519
we could actually extend that for the

1712
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:14,960
whole year

1713
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:17,039
we're a small team at stanford and we're

1714
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:19,599
trying to keep up with great things to

1715
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:22,639
put on the site um

1716
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:24,480
we haven't the capacity to produce these

1717
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:26,159
creative visual math tasks for every

1718
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:28,079
year group for every day but i would

1719
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:29,598
love to do that how difficult is it to

1720
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,400
do i mean

1721
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:36,240
to come up

1722
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:38,000
with uh visual formulations of these uh

1723
00:59:36,239 --> 00:59:39,039
big important topics you need to think

1724
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,798
about

1725
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:43,599
in a way that you know

1726
00:59:40,798 --> 00:59:46,159
that uh that that you could teach i mean

1727
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:47,680
it we can do it we actually we went from

1728
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:48,639
the week of inspirational maths and we

1729
00:59:47,679 --> 00:59:52,159
made

1730
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:55,440
k-8 maths books with exactly that big

1731
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:57,118
ideas rich activities visuals we just

1732
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,240
finished the last one we've been doing

1733
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,798
it for

1734
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:03,118
five years and it's been exhausting and

1735
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:05,519
we just finished so now there's a whole

1736
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,280
k-8 set of books

1737
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:09,280
and they're organized in that way these

1738
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,640
are the big ideas here are rich deep

1739
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:11,920
activities

1740
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,639
um

1741
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,599
they're not though what you can do every

1742
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:19,598
day for a year that so some teachers use

1743
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:22,640
them as a kind of supplement to their

1744
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,960
boring textbook and some people have

1745
01:00:22,639 --> 01:00:27,118
said okay this is the year this book

1746
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:29,920
tells us what the year is and then we'll

1747
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:32,798
supplement these big activities with

1748
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,760
um so they're being used and teachers

1749
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:35,280
really

1750
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:36,079
like them and are really happy about

1751
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,240
them

1752
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,079
i just always want more and i guess one

1753
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:42,639
of the things i would like for you cubed

1754
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:45,519
one of my personal goals is that every

1755
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:48,000
teacher of maths knows about youtube

1756
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:49,519
at the moment um a lot of teachers who

1757
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,119
come to us are really happy they found

1758
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:52,318
it but there's a lot of other teachers

1759
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,079
who

1760
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:57,920
don't know that it exists i hope this

1761
01:00:54,079 --> 01:01:00,640
helps yeah from a student perspective

1762
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,240
and not in the classroom but at home

1763
01:01:00,639 --> 01:01:03,759
studying

1764
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:05,919
and you know

1765
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:08,559
is there some

1766
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:10,720
advice you can give on how to best study

1767
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:13,680
mathematics so what's the role of the

1768
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:17,118
student outside the classroom

1769
01:01:13,679 --> 01:01:19,519
yeah i think one thing we know is a lot

1770
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:21,280
of people when they review material

1771
01:01:19,519 --> 01:01:23,519
whether it's maths or anything else

1772
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:25,760
don't do it in the best way

1773
01:01:23,519 --> 01:01:27,838
i think a problem a lot of people have

1774
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:31,440
is they read through maybe a teacher's

1775
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:33,199
explanation or a way of doing maths

1776
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:36,240
and it makes sense and they think oh

1777
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:38,798
yeah i've got that and they move on

1778
01:01:36,239 --> 01:01:40,479
but then it's not until you come to try

1779
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:41,519
and work on something and do a problem

1780
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,280
that you actually realize you didn't

1781
01:01:41,519 --> 01:01:44,798
really understand it just seemed to make

1782
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:47,200
sense

1783
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:48,719
so i would say

1784
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:50,558
this is also something that

1785
01:01:48,719 --> 01:01:53,679
neuroscientists talk about

1786
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,359
to keep giving yourself questions is a

1787
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:56,558
really good way to

1788
01:01:55,358 --> 01:01:58,078
study

1789
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,319
rather than looking through lots of

1790
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:02,559
material it's almost like giving

1791
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:04,639
yourself lots of tests

1792
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:06,079
is a good way to actually deeply

1793
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:08,318
understand things and know what you do

1794
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,760
when you don't understand so would the

1795
01:02:08,318 --> 01:02:11,358
questions be

1796
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:13,280
in the form of

1797
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:15,199
the material you're reviewing is the

1798
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:17,200
answer to that question or is it almost

1799
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:19,358
like beyond it's the polygon thing you

1800
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:21,439
mentioned from a square is it almost

1801
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:23,519
like i wonder

1802
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:24,480
what is the bigger picture i was kind of

1803
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:27,199
asking

1804
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,519
like how's this extended and so on yeah

1805
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:31,199
that that that would be great and it's a

1806
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:32,960
similar i mean a question i get asked a

1807
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:34,879
lot is about homework well it's a good

1808
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,920
thing for kids to do for homework

1809
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,720
and one of the recommendations i give is

1810
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:41,519
to

1811
01:02:38,719 --> 01:02:42,719
not have kids just do lots of questions

1812
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:45,119
for homework

1813
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:46,798
but to actually ask them to reflect on

1814
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:49,838
what they've learned like what was the

1815
01:02:46,798 --> 01:02:51,199
big idea you were you learned today or

1816
01:02:49,838 --> 01:02:52,639
what did you

1817
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:55,279
find difficult what did you struggle

1818
01:02:52,639 --> 01:02:56,719
with what was something that was

1819
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,160
exciting

1820
01:02:56,719 --> 01:03:00,399
um

1821
01:02:58,159 --> 01:03:02,798
then kids go home and they have to kind

1822
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:04,000
of reflect in a deeper way a lot of

1823
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:05,519
times i don't if you have this

1824
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,838
experience as a math student lots of

1825
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:09,838
people do kids are going through maths

1826
01:03:07,838 --> 01:03:11,679
questions they're successful they get

1827
01:03:09,838 --> 01:03:14,639
them right but they don't even really

1828
01:03:11,679 --> 01:03:16,399
know what they're about they and a lot

1829
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,239
of kids go through many years of maths

1830
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,880
like that doing lots of questions but

1831
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:23,519
that really knowing what even

1832
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,440
the topic is or what it's about what

1833
01:03:23,519 --> 01:03:28,000
it's important for so

1834
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,480
having students go back and think at the

1835
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:32,159
end of the day what was the big idea

1836
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,358
from this maths lesson why is it

1837
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:35,920
important

1838
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:38,558
where would i find that in real life

1839
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:40,798
those are really good questions for kids

1840
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,720
to be thinking about it's probably for

1841
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:44,400
everybody to be thinking about i think

1842
01:03:42,719 --> 01:03:46,480
most of us go through life

1843
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:49,358
never asking

1844
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,039
like the bigger question almost like

1845
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,719
you know those like layers of why

1846
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,119
questions that kids ask when they're

1847
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:55,919
very young yeah we need to keep doing

1848
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:58,640
that

1849
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,240
we do like what uh that's the you know

1850
01:03:58,639 --> 01:04:02,480
whatever the term is you call first

1851
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:05,519
principles thinking some people call it

1852
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,719
that which is like

1853
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:08,400
why

1854
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:11,038
are we doing it this way

1855
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,480
so one nice thing

1856
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:14,319
is to do that because there's usually a

1857
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,639
good answer like the reason we did it

1858
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,599
this way is because it works for this

1859
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,440
reason

1860
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:22,400
but then if you want to do something

1861
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:25,039
totally novel is you'll say well

1862
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:28,720
we've been doing it this way

1863
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:30,400
um because of historical reasons but

1864
01:04:28,719 --> 01:04:32,159
really this is not the best way to do it

1865
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,318
there might be other ways

1866
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:36,000
and that's how invention happens right

1867
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:38,798
and then you get you know that's really

1868
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:40,400
useful in every aspect of life like

1869
01:04:38,798 --> 01:04:42,239
choosing your career

1870
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,720
choosing your um

1871
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:47,038
i don't know what where you live yeah

1872
01:04:44,719 --> 01:04:49,679
who your like romantic partner is like

1873
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,599
everything everything yeah and i think

1874
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:54,159
it probably starts

1875
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:55,920
doing that in math class

1876
01:04:54,159 --> 01:04:57,679
that would be good if we started doing i

1877
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,798
want i mean i wonder

1878
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:00,960
i

1879
01:04:58,798 --> 01:05:03,759
i probably didn't do very much of that

1880
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:07,199
for most of my education asking why

1881
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:10,079
except for later much later

1882
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:12,159
in the subjects on like grad school when

1883
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:13,680
you're doing research on them

1884
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:15,118
when you're first tasked with doing

1885
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:16,719
something novel

1886
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:18,960
using this

1887
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:21,038
or solving a problem really outside the

1888
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:22,559
classroom they have to publish on it's

1889
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:25,200
the first time you think

1890
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:27,599
wait why are these things

1891
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:29,358
uh interesting useful which are the

1892
01:05:27,599 --> 01:05:31,359
things that are useful

1893
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,679
and yeah i guess that was that would be

1894
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:36,880
nice if we did that much earlier that uh

1895
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:39,358
the quest of invention yeah yeah

1896
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,920
i mean one of the sad pieces of research

1897
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:43,358
data i think about is the questions kids

1898
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:47,920
ask

1899
01:05:43,358 --> 01:05:50,558
um in school goes down like in a linear

1900
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,798
uh you know progression from in the

1901
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,039
early years you can't stop kids asking

1902
01:05:52,798 --> 01:05:57,119
those questions but they learn

1903
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,079
not to ask the questions i think you

1904
01:05:57,119 --> 01:06:00,400
told

1905
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:02,400
somewhere about an early memory you had

1906
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,559
in your own education

1907
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:06,160
where you asked the question

1908
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,798
or maybe that was an example you gave

1909
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:12,078
but it was shut down oh yeah

1910
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:13,440
you've listened to something i said yeah

1911
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:15,599
i don't remember where it was it was

1912
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,599
something yeah it caught me yeah i

1913
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,240
remember it really vividly

1914
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:22,079
what can you tell uh the memory yeah it

1915
01:06:20,239 --> 01:06:23,919
was it's funny i can remember it must

1916
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:25,599
have really impacted me in that moment

1917
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:27,039
because you know how there's lots of

1918
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:29,838
hours of school you don't remember at

1919
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:31,200
all but anyway um i i remember where i

1920
01:06:29,838 --> 01:06:33,679
was sitting and everything i was in a

1921
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,279
high school maths class although they

1922
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:37,440
don't call it in england

1923
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:39,599
and um

1924
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:42,000
the teacher said and it was like the

1925
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:44,400
first class of this teacher's class and

1926
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,639
he said ask if you have any questions

1927
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:48,160
so at one point i put my hand up and i

1928
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:49,759
said i have a question

1929
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:51,118
and he said something like that's your

1930
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:52,230
question

1931
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:53,760
um

1932
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:56,000
[Laughter]

1933
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,440
and i was like oh okay i'm not asking

1934
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:59,920
any more questions

1935
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,440
hard in a way where you didn't wanna you

1936
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:03,280
the lesson you learned from that is i'm

1937
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,200
not gonna ask yeah that was absolutely

1938
01:07:03,280 --> 01:07:06,319
that's nice that's the last question i'm

1939
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:07,119
asking

1940
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:08,480
and um

1941
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:09,920
[Music]

1942
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,440
i was

1943
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:13,680
yeah he was the chair of the maths

1944
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,838
department i remember that really well

1945
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:15,838
so

1946
01:07:16,318 --> 01:07:20,079
maybe because of that experience one of

1947
01:07:18,318 --> 01:07:22,159
the things we encourage when we teach

1948
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,519
kids is asking questions and we value it

1949
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,838
when they ask questions we put them up

1950
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:29,599
on walls and celebrate and

1951
01:07:26,838 --> 01:07:31,358
um it's funny because

1952
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:33,359
i wish there was a feedback signal

1953
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:35,598
because he probably

1954
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:37,598
to put a positive spin on it he probably

1955
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:40,318
didn't realize the negative impact he's

1956
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,680
had in that moment right if he only knew

1957
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:44,000
see this is probably when you're more

1958
01:07:41,679 --> 01:07:46,159
mature in grad school

1959
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:48,960
i had an amazing professor named ali

1960
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:51,279
shakafande in uh computer science and he

1961
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:52,880
would get he encouraged questions but

1962
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,240
then he would tell everybody how dumb

1963
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,440
their questions are

1964
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:58,078
but it was

1965
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:00,720
it was done i guess if you show if you

1966
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:03,039
say it with love and respect behind it

1967
01:08:00,719 --> 01:08:05,199
then it's more like a friendly humorous

1968
01:08:03,039 --> 01:08:07,440
encouragement for more questions

1969
01:08:05,199 --> 01:08:09,118
yeah it's an art right yeah to do it

1970
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,200
you're right and then it's very hard you

1971
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,720
have to time it right because that's

1972
01:08:11,199 --> 01:08:14,318
probably that kind of humor is probably

1973
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:16,479
better for when you're

1974
01:08:14,318 --> 01:08:18,719
uh in grad school versus when you're in

1975
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:20,559
the early education right

1976
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:24,880
well and i guess kids

1977
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:28,159
or young people get whether somebody's

1978
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:30,079
doing it to be funny or you know

1979
01:08:28,158 --> 01:08:32,879
has it there's i mean this is why i

1980
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:35,119
teach you so hard even your tone

1981
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,079
can be impactful

1982
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:40,559
it's so sad because like for

1983
01:08:38,079 --> 01:08:43,119
for that particular human the teacher

1984
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:45,440
you could just had a bad day and one

1985
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:48,960
statement can have a profound negative

1986
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:51,278
impact i know sadly that maths there's a

1987
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:54,000
lot of maths teachers who have that kind

1988
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:55,920
of approach and they

1989
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,198
i think they're suffering from the fact

1990
01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,880
that they think people are math people

1991
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:01,039
are not math people and that comes

1992
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,960
across in their teaching

1993
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:04,880
but on the flip side one positive

1994
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:07,198
statement yeah keep them going that's

1995
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:10,079
right that is the flip side of that

1996
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:12,798
and i myself had like one teacher who

1997
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:14,719
was really amazing for me in maths and

1998
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:16,319
she kept me in the subject

1999
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,319
like

2000
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:19,199
who was she she was

2001
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:20,600
um

2002
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:24,238
her name was mrs marshall

2003
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:27,920
[Laughter]

2004
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:30,718
um she was my a level maths teacher so i

2005
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:32,838
was in i mean in england you do lots of

2006
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:35,679
subjects so you're 16 and then you

2007
01:09:32,838 --> 01:09:37,838
choose like three or four subjects so i

2008
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,600
chosen maths and

2009
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:41,439
you go to

2010
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,520
higher levels

2011
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,358
probably equivalent more to a master's

2012
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,159
degree in the us because you're more

2013
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:50,400
specialized but anyways she was my

2014
01:09:48,158 --> 01:09:52,639
teacher and for the first time in my

2015
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:55,439
whole career in maths

2016
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:57,920
she would give us problems and tell us

2017
01:09:55,439 --> 01:10:00,960
to talk about them with each other

2018
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:02,960
and so here i was sitting there like 17

2019
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:04,960
talking with friends about how to solve

2020
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:07,679
a math problem and that was it that was

2021
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:10,800
the change that she made

2022
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,840
but it was profound for me i because

2023
01:10:10,800 --> 01:10:14,239
like those

2024
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,239
calculus students i started to hear

2025
01:10:14,238 --> 01:10:18,559
other people's ways of thinking and

2026
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:20,158
seeing it we would talk together and

2027
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,400
come up with solutions and i was like

2028
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:24,000
that was it that changed maths for me

2029
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:25,759
and i know so it wasn't some kind of

2030
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:26,880
personal interaction with her it was

2031
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,239
more like

2032
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:29,440
she uh

2033
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:31,919
she was the catalyst for that

2034
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:34,000
collaborative experience

2035
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:36,000
i mean yeah the many ways teachers can

2036
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:37,600
inspire kids i mean sometimes it's a

2037
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:40,560
personal message but

2038
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:42,320
it can be your teaching approach that

2039
01:10:40,560 --> 01:10:44,880
changes maths for kids

2040
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:48,479
you know uh cal newport

2041
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:50,400
he uh he wrote a book called deep work

2042
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:52,879
and he's a mathematician a theoretical

2043
01:10:50,399 --> 01:10:55,279
computer scientist and he talks about

2044
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:58,480
the kind of the focus required

2045
01:10:55,279 --> 01:10:59,439
yeah to do that kind of work is there

2046
01:10:58,479 --> 01:11:01,599
something

2047
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:03,279
you can comment on

2048
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,880
you know we live in a in a world full of

2049
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:07,279
distractions

2050
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,119
that that seems like one of the elements

2051
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:10,800
that makes studying and especially the

2052
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:13,279
studying of subjects that require

2053
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,400
thinking like math does

2054
01:11:13,279 --> 01:11:16,800
difficult

2055
01:11:14,399 --> 01:11:18,559
is there something from a student

2056
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:20,480
perspective from a teacher perspective

2057
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:23,280
that encourages deep work

2058
01:11:20,479 --> 01:11:24,839
that you can come up with yeah i think

2059
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:29,039
giving kids

2060
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:31,440
really inspiring deep problems and we

2061
01:11:29,039 --> 01:11:33,439
have some on our website

2062
01:11:31,439 --> 01:11:34,238
is a really important experience for

2063
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:38,158
them

2064
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:39,039
um even if they only do it occasionally

2065
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:41,119
but

2066
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:43,920
it's really important they actually

2067
01:11:41,119 --> 01:11:45,599
realize i i do i give a problem out

2068
01:11:43,920 --> 01:11:47,600
often when i'm working with teachers and

2069
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,679
i say to them all right i'm going to

2070
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:52,320
check in with you after an hour

2071
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:53,440
and they're like an hour they think it's

2072
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:55,519
shocking

2073
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:57,279
and then they work on this problem and

2074
01:11:55,520 --> 01:12:00,480
after an hour i say okay how are we

2075
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:03,119
doing like an hour's gone by

2076
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:03,919
how is this possible yeah and

2077
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:06,880
so

2078
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:09,840
everybody needs those like rich deep

2079
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:13,039
problems most kids go through their

2080
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:14,880
whole maths experience of however many

2081
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:16,640
years never once

2082
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,000
working on a problem in that kind of

2083
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,800
deep way

2084
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:21,359
so

2085
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:23,360
i the the undergrad class i teach at

2086
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:24,719
stanford we do that we work on these

2087
01:12:23,359 --> 01:12:26,238
deep problems

2088
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,319
every session

2089
01:12:26,238 --> 01:12:30,479
and the students come away going okay i

2090
01:12:28,319 --> 01:12:31,920
never want to go back to that maths

2091
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,079
relationship i had where it was just all

2092
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,960
about quick answers i

2093
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:38,399
i just don't want to go back to that and

2094
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:40,719
so

2095
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:42,479
we can all all teachers can incorporate

2096
01:12:40,719 --> 01:12:44,480
those problems in their classrooms maybe

2097
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:47,119
they don't do them every day but

2098
01:12:44,479 --> 01:12:48,079
they at least give kids some experience

2099
01:12:47,119 --> 01:12:50,880
of

2100
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:53,760
being able to work slowly and deeply and

2101
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:55,279
to go to deeper places and

2102
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:56,239
not

2103
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:58,158
be

2104
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:00,399
told they've got five minutes to finish

2105
01:12:58,158 --> 01:13:02,960
20 questions yeah well part of it is

2106
01:13:00,399 --> 01:13:04,399
also just the um

2107
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,079
the exercise of sitting there

2108
01:13:04,399 --> 01:13:07,039
maintaining focus for prolonged periods

2109
01:13:06,079 --> 01:13:09,359
of time

2110
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:12,238
that's not often

2111
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:13,599
i mean um that's a skill yeah it's a

2112
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:15,919
skill

2113
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:18,320
that uh that also could be discouraging

2114
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:20,560
like if you don't practice it just

2115
01:13:18,319 --> 01:13:21,920
sitting down for 10 minutes straight and

2116
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:24,080
maintaining deep focus could be

2117
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:26,560
exceptionally challenging like if you're

2118
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:28,640
really thinking about a problem

2119
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:30,159
and to re i think it's really important

2120
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:30,960
to realize that that's a skill that you

2121
01:13:30,158 --> 01:13:32,559
can

2122
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,079
just like a muscle you can build you can

2123
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:36,719
start with five minutes it goes to 10

2124
01:13:34,079 --> 01:13:38,479
minutes to 30 into an hour and

2125
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:41,119
and to be successful i think in certain

2126
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:43,678
subjects like mathematics you want to be

2127
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:47,920
able to develop that skill otherwise

2128
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:50,480
you're not going to get to the the

2129
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:52,399
really rewarding experience of solving

2130
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:53,439
these problems

2131
01:13:52,399 --> 01:13:55,599
definitely

2132
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:56,960
there was a survey done of kids in

2133
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:58,560
school where they were asked how long

2134
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:00,719
will you work on a maths problem before

2135
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,440
you give up and decide it's not

2136
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:05,920
possible to solve that question and the

2137
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:08,479
result on average across the kids was

2138
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:08,480
two minutes

2139
01:14:09,198 --> 01:14:12,719
yeah

2140
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:14,559
so that's

2141
01:14:12,719 --> 01:14:17,439
a bad sign but that's that was the

2142
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,440
powerful sign that uh they need to learn

2143
01:14:17,439 --> 01:14:20,319
to not give up so quickly

2144
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:22,799
yeah

2145
01:14:20,319 --> 01:14:24,479
uh we mentioned offline

2146
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,400
because we've been talking so much about

2147
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:29,198
visualization

2148
01:14:26,399 --> 01:14:30,238
uh grant sanderson three luanne brown

2149
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:32,238
so

2150
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:34,879
he's inspired millions of people with

2151
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:36,238
the kind of uh exactly the kind of way

2152
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:38,480
of thinking that you've been talking

2153
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:41,198
about yeah i love his

2154
01:14:38,479 --> 01:14:44,799
work converting sort of uh

2155
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:45,678
mathematical concepts into visual

2156
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,079
uh

2157
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:50,319
like uh visually representing them

2158
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:52,719
exploring them in ways that uh help you

2159
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:53,599
illuminate like the concepts

2160
01:14:52,719 --> 01:14:55,119
um

2161
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:57,199
what do you think is the role of that so

2162
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:58,719
he uses mostly programmatic

2163
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:01,359
visualization so it's the thing i

2164
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:05,039
mentioned where there's like animations

2165
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:07,119
created by writing uh computer programs

2166
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:09,198
um like what what do you think how

2167
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:10,399
scalable is that approach but in general

2168
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:12,639
what do you think about his impression i

2169
01:15:10,399 --> 01:15:14,559
think it's amazing i should work with

2170
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:17,199
him

2171
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:20,880
i i can share some of our visuals and he

2172
01:15:17,198 --> 01:15:23,359
can make them in that amazing way um

2173
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,880
so part of his storytelling part of it

2174
01:15:23,359 --> 01:15:26,960
is like

2175
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,359
it's creating the visuals and then

2176
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:32,079
weaving a story with those visuals

2177
01:15:29,359 --> 01:15:33,119
that kind of builds like there's also i

2178
01:15:32,079 --> 01:15:35,439
mean

2179
01:15:33,119 --> 01:15:37,760
there's also drama in it you start with

2180
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:40,639
a small example and then you kind of all

2181
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:42,800
of a sudden there's a surprise yeah yeah

2182
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,719
yeah and it really i mean it makes you

2183
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:48,400
fall in love with the that's right with

2184
01:15:44,719 --> 01:15:51,520
the concept yeah he does talk about that

2185
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:55,198
his sense is like some of the stuff he

2186
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:57,679
he he doesn't feel like he's teaching

2187
01:15:55,198 --> 01:16:00,000
like the core curriculum which is

2188
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:02,560
something you know

2189
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:03,520
he sees himself as an inspirational

2190
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:05,679
figure

2191
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:08,000
but because i think it's too difficult

2192
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:09,600
to kind of convert all of the curriculum

2193
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,760
into those elements

2194
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,640
and probably you don't need to i mean

2195
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:13,440
you

2196
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,440
if

2197
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:18,319
people get to experience mathematical

2198
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:20,238
ideas in the way that he shares them

2199
01:16:18,319 --> 01:16:21,920
um that will change them and it will

2200
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:23,519
change the way they they think and maybe

2201
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:25,039
they could go on to

2202
01:16:23,520 --> 01:16:27,760
take some other mathematical idea and

2203
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:28,960
make it that beautiful well he does that

2204
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:31,760
uh there's a

2205
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:34,158
he created a library called manum

2206
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:36,400
and he open-sourced it and that library

2207
01:16:34,158 --> 01:16:37,679
is the uh people should check it out

2208
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:39,519
it's

2209
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,920
written in python

2210
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,000
and it uses some of those same elements

2211
01:16:41,920 --> 01:16:46,399
like it allows you to animate equations

2212
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,279
and animate little shapes like people

2213
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:49,198
that

2214
01:16:47,279 --> 01:16:51,679
you know he has a very distinct style in

2215
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:53,599
his videos and what that resulted in

2216
01:16:51,679 --> 01:16:55,440
even though from a software engineer

2217
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,400
perspective the code he released is not

2218
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:58,960
like

2219
01:16:56,399 --> 01:17:01,759
super well documented or perfect

2220
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,079
but him releasing that

2221
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,400
now there's all of these other people

2222
01:17:04,079 --> 01:17:08,079
educating it and the cool to me

2223
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:09,839
personally the coolest thing is to see

2224
01:17:08,079 --> 01:17:12,000
like

2225
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:13,920
people they're not you know

2226
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:16,158
don't have like a million subscribers or

2227
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,640
something is they they they have just a

2228
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:19,439
few views on the video but it just seems

2229
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,560
like

2230
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:24,319
the process of them creating a video

2231
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:26,239
where they teach

2232
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:27,599
is like transformative to them yeah from

2233
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:29,279
a student perspective it's the old

2234
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:31,280
feynman thing the best way to learn is

2235
01:17:29,279 --> 01:17:33,840
to teach right and then him releasing

2236
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:36,158
that into the wild is yeah

2237
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:37,440
it shows that that impact yeah

2238
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:39,759
absolutely

2239
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:42,158
i think just giving people that idea

2240
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:43,840
that you can do that with maths and

2241
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:46,399
other subjects they're

2242
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:49,119
bound to be people all around who can

2243
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:51,279
create more which is cool yeah i

2244
01:17:49,119 --> 01:17:53,198
definitely so i recommend people do like

2245
01:17:51,279 --> 01:17:55,439
javascript or python you can you can

2246
01:17:53,198 --> 01:17:57,919
build like visualizations of

2247
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:59,919
most concepts in high school math you

2248
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:01,440
can do a lot of kinds of visualizations

2249
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:03,199
and doing that yourself

2250
01:18:01,439 --> 01:18:06,238
plus if you do that yourself people

2251
01:18:03,198 --> 01:18:08,960
really love it people actually

2252
01:18:06,238 --> 01:18:10,718
people love visualizations of math

2253
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,960
yeah because they i mean it's something

2254
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:16,399
in us that loves patterns loves figuring

2255
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:18,960
out difficult things and the patterns in

2256
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:21,920
that are then are unexpected in some way

2257
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:24,079
yeah have you ever noticed that hotels

2258
01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:25,600
are always filled with patterns

2259
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:28,079
i was just noticing at the hotel i mean

2260
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,760
now all of their carpets are patent

2261
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:30,800
carpets and then they have patterns on

2262
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,480
the walls

2263
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:34,800
yeah so

2264
01:18:32,479 --> 01:18:36,879
yeah we humans love

2265
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:38,840
the symmetry and patterns the breaking

2266
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:42,079
of symmetry patterns

2267
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:43,920
yeah and it's funny that we don't see

2268
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:46,158
mathematics is somehow intricately

2269
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,760
connected to that but it is right i mean

2270
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:49,679
that's one of the perspectives i love

2271
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:50,960
students to take is to be a pattern

2272
01:18:49,679 --> 01:18:52,960
seeker

2273
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,800
in everything in in yeah certainly in

2274
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:56,480
all of maths i mean you can think of all

2275
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:58,000
of maths as a kind of subject of

2276
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:01,198
patterns and

2277
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,279
not just visual patterns but

2278
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:05,678
you know when you think about

2279
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:07,679
multiplying by five

2280
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:09,840
and the fact you can

2281
01:19:07,679 --> 01:19:11,199
you know if you if you're multiplying 18

2282
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:14,640
times 5

2283
01:19:11,198 --> 01:19:16,639
you can instead think of 9 times 10.

2284
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:18,000
that's a pattern that always works in

2285
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:20,079
mathematics you can have a number and

2286
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:21,520
double number and so yeah i just think

2287
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:23,840
there are patterns everywhere and if

2288
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,640
kids are thinking their role is to see

2289
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:28,480
patterns and find patterns it's

2290
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,640
really exciting

2291
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:31,919
what do you think about like mit open

2292
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:34,880
courseware

2293
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:37,679
and the release of lectures by

2294
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:39,600
universities i think it's good

2295
01:19:37,679 --> 01:19:42,158
i think it's good i think the

2296
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,039
that is what started

2297
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:44,879
the

2298
01:19:43,039 --> 01:19:46,880
mooc i did was

2299
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:49,119
using that platform so you ultimately

2300
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,400
think like the udacity model is a little

2301
01:19:49,119 --> 01:19:52,559
bit more effective

2302
01:19:50,399 --> 01:19:54,079
than just a plain two-hour lecture i

2303
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,960
think there's definitely you can bring

2304
01:19:54,079 --> 01:19:59,119
in good pedagogy into online learning

2305
01:19:56,960 --> 01:20:00,960
and i think the idea of putting things

2306
01:19:59,119 --> 01:20:03,119
online so that people all over the world

2307
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:06,000
can access them it's great i don't think

2308
01:20:03,119 --> 01:20:08,399
the initial excitement around moocs

2309
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:10,000
sort of democratizing education and

2310
01:20:08,399 --> 01:20:11,039
making it more equal

2311
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:13,039
um

2312
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:14,719
came about because they found that the

2313
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:17,039
people taking moocs tended to be the

2314
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:19,679
more privileged people

2315
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:21,600
so that was i think there's still

2316
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:23,760
something to be found in that there's

2317
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:24,560
still more to be done to

2318
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,880
help

2319
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,400
that online learning reach those

2320
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,960
principles but

2321
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:33,839
um definitely i think it's it's a good

2322
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:36,639
invention and i have an online class

2323
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:38,560
that's for kids that's little free class

2324
01:20:36,639 --> 01:20:41,359
that gives them a topic it's called how

2325
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:41,360
to learn maths

2326
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,159
it shows maths as this visual creative

2327
01:20:43,840 --> 01:20:48,079
subject and it shares mindset and some

2328
01:20:46,158 --> 01:20:49,119
brain science and

2329
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:50,880
um

2330
01:20:49,119 --> 01:20:52,639
kids who take it do better in maths

2331
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:55,199
class we've studied it with like

2332
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:58,319
randomized controlled trials and

2333
01:20:55,198 --> 01:21:00,158
given it to middle school kids and other

2334
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:01,679
middle school kids who don't take it but

2335
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:03,679
are taught by the same teachers so their

2336
01:21:01,679 --> 01:21:05,840
teachers are the same and the kids who

2337
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:09,359
take the online class end up

2338
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:11,600
68 more engaged in their maths class and

2339
01:21:09,359 --> 01:21:14,639
do better at the end of the year so

2340
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:16,560
that's a little six session 15 minute

2341
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:19,920
class and

2342
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:23,199
it changes kids maths relationships so

2343
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:24,880
it is true that we can do that with some

2344
01:21:23,198 --> 01:21:27,279
words

2345
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:30,319
that aren't you know not it's not a huge

2346
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:33,119
change to the education system

2347
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:34,719
do you have advice for young people

2348
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:36,000
we've been talking about mathematics

2349
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,480
quite a bit

2350
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,800
but in terms of their journey through

2351
01:21:38,479 --> 01:21:43,519
education through their career choices

2352
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:46,239
through life maybe middle school high

2353
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:48,000
school undergrad students

2354
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:50,479
how to live a life that they can be

2355
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:50,479
proud of

2356
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:56,719
i think if i were to give advice to

2357
01:21:53,359 --> 01:21:58,799
people especially young people my advice

2358
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:02,399
would be to

2359
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:04,320
always it sounds really corny but always

2360
01:22:02,399 --> 01:22:06,479
believe in yourself and know that you

2361
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,000
can achieve because

2362
01:22:06,479 --> 01:22:09,439
although that sounds like obvious of

2363
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,840
course we want kids to know that they

2364
01:22:09,439 --> 01:22:13,198
can achieve things i know that

2365
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,360
millions of kids are in the school

2366
01:22:13,198 --> 01:22:17,279
system have been given the message they

2367
01:22:15,359 --> 01:22:19,439
cannot do things

2368
01:22:17,279 --> 01:22:21,840
and adults too

2369
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:24,158
they have the idea oh i did okay in this

2370
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:26,880
i went into this job because those other

2371
01:22:24,158 --> 01:22:29,279
things i could never have done okay in

2372
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:31,520
so actually when they hear hey maybe you

2373
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:34,319
could do those other things

2374
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:36,400
even adults think you know

2375
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:38,238
maybe i can and they go back and they

2376
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:40,719
encounter this knowledge and they

2377
01:22:38,238 --> 01:22:41,519
relearn things and they change careers

2378
01:22:40,719 --> 01:22:43,520
and

2379
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:45,360
amazing things happen so

2380
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:47,840
for me i think that message is really

2381
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:50,238
important you can learn anything

2382
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:51,440
scientists try and find a limit they're

2383
01:22:50,238 --> 01:22:52,799
always trying to find a limit like how

2384
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:54,479
much can you really learn what's the

2385
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:56,159
limit to how much you can earn and they

2386
01:22:54,479 --> 01:22:58,079
always come away not being able to find

2387
01:22:56,158 --> 01:23:00,638
it people can just go further and

2388
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:01,439
further and further and that is true of

2389
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,440
people

2390
01:23:01,439 --> 01:23:05,439
born with brain

2391
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:06,879
um you know areas of their brain that

2392
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:08,638
aren't functioning well that have what

2393
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,319
we call special needs

2394
01:23:08,639 --> 01:23:11,679
some of those people also go on to

2395
01:23:10,319 --> 01:23:13,920
develop and

2396
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:17,440
do amazing things so

2397
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:19,440
i think that really experiencing that

2398
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,198
knowing that feeling not just saying it

2399
01:23:19,439 --> 01:23:22,238
but knowing it

2400
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:24,158
deeply

2401
01:23:22,238 --> 01:23:26,319
you can learn anything

2402
01:23:24,158 --> 01:23:28,719
is um

2403
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:30,238
something i wish all people would have

2404
01:23:28,719 --> 01:23:32,560
actually also applies when you've

2405
01:23:30,238 --> 01:23:33,759
achieved some level of success too what

2406
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:36,320
i find

2407
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,159
like in my life with people that love me

2408
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:40,399
when you achieve success

2409
01:23:38,158 --> 01:23:42,799
they keep celebrating your success and

2410
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:45,519
they want you to keep doing the thing

2411
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:48,560
that you were successful at as opposed

2412
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:49,920
to believing in that you can do

2413
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,239
something else something big whatever

2414
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:54,319
your heart says to do right and one of

2415
01:23:52,238 --> 01:23:55,678
the things that i realized the value of

2416
01:23:54,319 --> 01:23:57,279
this

2417
01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,600
um

2418
01:23:57,279 --> 01:24:00,479
you know quite recently which is sad to

2419
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,199
say

2420
01:24:00,479 --> 01:24:04,959
is how important it is to seek out uh

2421
01:24:03,198 --> 01:24:06,479
when you're younger to seek out mentors

2422
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:07,359
to seek out the

2423
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:08,959
people

2424
01:24:07,359 --> 01:24:11,439
like surround yourself with people that

2425
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:14,079
will believe in you yeah it's like a

2426
01:24:11,439 --> 01:24:17,759
little bit of is on you

2427
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:20,319
it's like uh you don't get that um

2428
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:22,320
sometimes if you go to like grad school

2429
01:24:20,319 --> 01:24:24,079
you think you kind of land on a mentor

2430
01:24:22,319 --> 01:24:26,000
maybe you pick a mentor based on the

2431
01:24:24,079 --> 01:24:27,760
topic they're interested in but the

2432
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,960
reality is the people you surround

2433
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,639
yourself with

2434
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:34,239
they're going to define

2435
01:24:30,639 --> 01:24:36,400
your life yeah trajectory so select

2436
01:24:34,238 --> 01:24:37,919
people they're really true and get away

2437
01:24:36,399 --> 01:24:38,719
from people who don't believe you don't

2438
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,719
yeah

2439
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:44,560
sometimes parents can be that they love

2440
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:46,560
you deeply but they be you know they set

2441
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,239
it's the math thing we mentioned they

2442
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:50,960
might set certain

2443
01:24:48,238 --> 01:24:52,000
constraints on the beliefs that you have

2444
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:52,880
and

2445
01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,479
so

2446
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:56,079
in that if you're interested in

2447
01:24:54,479 --> 01:24:57,359
mathematics and your parents are not

2448
01:24:56,079 --> 01:24:59,679
that interested in it don't listen to

2449
01:24:57,359 --> 01:25:00,880
your parents on that one dimension

2450
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:02,560
exactly

2451
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:04,239
yeah and if people tell you you can't do

2452
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,480
things you have to

2453
01:25:04,238 --> 01:25:08,319
hear from other people who who believe

2454
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:09,359
you i think you're absolutely right

2455
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:11,279
about that

2456
01:25:09,359 --> 01:25:14,079
so sad the number of people who've had

2457
01:25:11,279 --> 01:25:16,079
those negative messages from parents

2458
01:25:14,079 --> 01:25:17,760
in my limitless mind book i interviewed

2459
01:25:16,079 --> 01:25:20,000
quite a few people who'd been told they

2460
01:25:17,760 --> 01:25:21,760
couldn't do math sometimes by parents

2461
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:22,639
sometimes by teachers

2462
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,960
and

2463
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:26,800
fortunately they had got other ideas at

2464
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:29,359
some point in their life and

2465
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:31,360
realized there was this whole world of

2466
01:25:29,359 --> 01:25:32,399
mathematical thinking that was open to

2467
01:25:31,359 --> 01:25:33,359
them

2468
01:25:32,399 --> 01:25:35,839
so

2469
01:25:33,359 --> 01:25:36,960
it's really important that people

2470
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:39,119
do

2471
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:40,960
connect with people who believe in them

2472
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:42,079
however hard that might be to find those

2473
01:25:40,960 --> 01:25:44,880
people

2474
01:25:42,079 --> 01:25:48,000
what do you hope the education system

2475
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,520
education in general looks like 10 20 50

2476
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,679
100 years from now

2477
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:53,920
are you optimistic about this future

2478
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:55,760
yeah i definitely have hope there is

2479
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:58,600
change can happen in the education

2480
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:01,039
system in recent years it's been

2481
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:01,840
microscopically slow

2482
01:26:01,039 --> 01:26:03,359
and

2483
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,800
um

2484
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:07,279
but

2485
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:09,360
i do actually see change happening like

2486
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:11,439
we were talking earlier that

2487
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:14,319
data science is now a course you can

2488
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:16,638
take in high school instead of algebra 2

2489
01:26:14,319 --> 01:26:20,079
and that's pretty amazing because

2490
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:23,279
that content was set out in 1892 and

2491
01:26:20,079 --> 01:26:25,519
hasn't changed since then and so now

2492
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:27,840
we're actually seeing a change in the

2493
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,679
content of high school so

2494
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:31,279
i'm amazed that that's happening and

2495
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:33,600
very happy it's happening but

2496
01:26:31,279 --> 01:26:35,359
so change is very slow in education

2497
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:37,600
usually but

2498
01:26:35,359 --> 01:26:40,719
when you look ahead

2499
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,719
and think about all that we know

2500
01:26:40,719 --> 01:26:45,279
and all that we can offer kids in terms

2501
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:47,760
of technology

2502
01:26:45,279 --> 01:26:48,559
you've got to think that 100 years from

2503
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:51,360
now

2504
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:53,520
education will be totally different to

2505
01:26:51,359 --> 01:26:56,000
the way it is now maybe we won't have

2506
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:58,159
subject boundaries anymore

2507
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,198
because those don't really make much

2508
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:04,399
sense it's interesting to think

2509
01:27:01,198 --> 01:27:05,678
how certain tools like programming maybe

2510
01:27:04,399 --> 01:27:07,279
they'll be deeply integrated and

2511
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:08,880
everything you think yeah you would

2512
01:27:07,279 --> 01:27:10,479
think that all kids are growing up

2513
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:11,359
learning to program

2514
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:12,799
and

2515
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:15,359
create

2516
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:17,279
so um i just think i mean the system of

2517
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:18,880
schooling we have now people call it a

2518
01:27:17,279 --> 01:27:19,759
factory model

2519
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:24,960
it's

2520
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:27,600
not designed to inspire creativity and

2521
01:27:24,960 --> 01:27:29,279
i feel like that will also change people

2522
01:27:27,600 --> 01:27:31,360
might look back on these days and think

2523
01:27:29,279 --> 01:27:34,238
they were hilarious but

2524
01:27:31,359 --> 01:27:35,279
um maybe we'll in the future kids will

2525
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:37,039
be doing their own programming and

2526
01:27:35,279 --> 01:27:38,880
they'll be able to learn things and find

2527
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:41,600
out things and create things even as

2528
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:44,800
they're learning and

2529
01:27:41,600 --> 01:27:45,840
maybe the individual subjects boundaries

2530
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:47,920
will go

2531
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:49,760
data science itself coming into the

2532
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,119
education system kind of illustrates

2533
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,440
that because

2534
01:27:51,119 --> 01:27:56,479
people realize it doesn't really fit

2535
01:27:53,439 --> 01:27:58,319
inside any of the subjects

2536
01:27:56,479 --> 01:28:02,479
so what do we do with it where does it

2537
01:27:58,319 --> 01:28:05,039
go and who teaches it so it's already

2538
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:07,039
raising those kind of questions and

2539
01:28:05,039 --> 01:28:08,960
questioning how we have these different

2540
01:28:07,039 --> 01:28:10,238
subject boundaries

2541
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,158
so you've seen data science be

2542
01:28:10,238 --> 01:28:14,399
integrated into the curriculum

2543
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:16,319
yes it's happening across the united

2544
01:28:14,399 --> 01:28:18,319
states as we speak i wonder how that got

2545
01:28:16,319 --> 01:28:20,559
initiated like how does change happen in

2546
01:28:18,319 --> 01:28:22,799
the education system is it just a few

2547
01:28:20,560 --> 01:28:25,120
revolutionary like it does

2548
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,800
i think so i think so it's been an

2549
01:28:25,119 --> 01:28:29,279
interesting journey seeing data science

2550
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,360
take off actually it um

2551
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:34,800
there was a

2552
01:28:31,359 --> 01:28:36,960
course that was developed in 2014

2553
01:28:34,800 --> 01:28:39,360
by some people who thought data science

2554
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:42,158
was a good idea for high schoolers

2555
01:28:39,359 --> 01:28:44,238
and then after some kids took the course

2556
01:28:42,158 --> 01:28:46,399
and nothing bad happened to them

2557
01:28:44,238 --> 01:28:49,198
they went to college and

2558
01:28:46,399 --> 01:28:51,119
people started to accept it more

2559
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:53,359
and then this was a big piece of the

2560
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:56,000
change in california the uc system

2561
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:58,158
communicated they sent out an email last

2562
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,319
year to 50 000 high schools saying we

2563
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:02,158
now accept data science kids can take it

2564
01:29:00,319 --> 01:29:04,880
instead of algebra two that's a

2565
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:07,279
perfectly legitimate college pathway so

2566
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,440
that was like a big green light for a

2567
01:29:07,279 --> 01:29:11,439
lot of schools who are like wondering

2568
01:29:09,439 --> 01:29:13,919
about whether they could teach it so i

2569
01:29:11,439 --> 01:29:16,638
think it happens in small spaces and

2570
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:18,639
expands so now it goes viral yeah in

2571
01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:20,960
this latter age then it goes viral

2572
01:29:18,639 --> 01:29:23,840
california's ahead

2573
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:27,679
um i think in creating courses and

2574
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:29,279
having kids go through it but it's

2575
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:31,359
suddenly when i last looked there were

2576
01:29:29,279 --> 01:29:32,719
12 states that were allowing data

2577
01:29:31,359 --> 01:29:33,439
science as a high school course and i

2578
01:29:32,719 --> 01:29:34,800
think

2579
01:29:33,439 --> 01:29:36,638
by next year

2580
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:39,440
that will have doubled

2581
01:29:36,639 --> 01:29:41,039
or more so

2582
01:29:39,439 --> 01:29:44,079
change is happening

2583
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:46,238
joe i as i said i think

2584
01:29:44,079 --> 01:29:48,960
mathematics is uh

2585
01:29:46,238 --> 01:29:50,799
is truly a beautiful subject and

2586
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:53,840
you having an impact on millions of

2587
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:56,079
people's lives by educating them by

2588
01:29:53,840 --> 01:29:58,000
inspiring teachers to educate

2589
01:29:56,079 --> 01:30:01,359
in the ways that you've talked about in

2590
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:03,359
multi-dimensional ways in visual ways um

2591
01:30:01,359 --> 01:30:06,000
i think is incredible so you're

2592
01:30:03,359 --> 01:30:07,759
spreading beauty appreciate that

2593
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:09,198
so i really really appreciate that you

2594
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:10,400
spend your valuable time with me today

2595
01:30:09,198 --> 01:30:12,479
thank you for talking thank you it's

2596
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:13,519
really good to talk to you

2597
01:30:12,479 --> 01:30:15,599
thanks for listening to this

2598
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:17,360
conversation with joe bowler to support
