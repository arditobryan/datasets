00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,519
travis oliphant

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,919
one of the most impactful programmers

4
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,919
and data scientists ever

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,798
he created numpy

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,559
scipy and anaconda

7
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:17,039
numpai formed the foundation of

8
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:18,879
tensor-based machine learning in python

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,359
scipy formed the foundation of

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:24,160
scientific programming in python and

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,480
anaconda specifically with conda made

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,599
python more accessible to a much larger

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,399
audience

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,640
travis's life work across a large number

15
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,199
of programming and entrepreneurial

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,320
efforts has and will continue to have

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,280
immeasurable impact on millions of lives

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,840
by empowering scientists and engineers

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,920
in big companies small companies and

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,320
open source communities to take on

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,480
difficult problems and solve them with

22
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,600
the power of programming

23
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,279
plus he's a truly kind human being which

24
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,760
is something that when combined with

25
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,960
vision and ambition makes for great

26
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,718
leader and a great person to chat with

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,799

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,840
this is the lex friedman podcast and

30
00:01:07,118 --> 00:01:11,438
here is my conversation with travis

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,520
oliphant

32
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:15,919
what was the first computer program

33
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,200
you've ever written do you remember whoa

34
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,079
that's a good question i think it was in

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:24,478
fourth grade just a simple uh loop in

36
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,759
basic basic basic on an atari 800 atari

37
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,478
400 i think or maybe there's an atari

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,879
800 it was at a part of a class and we

39
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,400
just were just basic loops

40
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:35,759
to print things out

41
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,600
did you use go to statements um yes yes

42
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,759
we used go to statements

43
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,078
i remember in the early days that's when

44
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,079
i first realized there's like principles

45
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,478
to programming when i was told that

46
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:48,639
don't use go to statements those are bad

47
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:49,920
software engineering prints like it goes

48
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,239
against

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,640
what great beautiful code is i was like

50
00:01:52,239 --> 00:01:56,239
oh okay there's rules to this game

51
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,920
i didn't see that until high school when

52
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,640
i took an ap computer science course

53
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,719
right i did a lot of other kinds of just

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,159
programming on ti but finally when i

55
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:05,679
took an ap computer science course in

56
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,920
pascal

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,719
wow that's that was pascal that's when i

58
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,120
oh there are these principles not c or c

59
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,120
plus plus no i didn't take c until uh

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,439
the next year in college i had a course

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,439
in c um but i haven't done much in

62
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:21,280
pascal just that ap computer science

63
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,359
course

64
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,080
now sorry for the romanticized question

65
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,160
but when did you first fall in love with

66
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,640
programming oh man good question i think

67
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:33,359
actually when i was 10 you know my dad

68
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,279
got us a t a timex sinclair

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,680
and uh he was excited about the

70
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,080
spreadsheet capability and then but i

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,080
made him get the basic the add-on so we

72
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
could actually program in basic and just

73
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,200
being able to write

74
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:47,318
instructions and have the computer do

75
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:50,238
something then we got a ti-99

76
00:02:47,318 --> 00:02:52,479
ti-994a when i was about 12 and i would

77
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,920
just it had sprites and graphics and

78
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:55,119
music you could actually program to do

79
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,119
music

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,680
that's when i really sort of fell in

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,400
love with programming so this is a full

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,480
like a real computer with like uh

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,400
with memory and storage yeah processors

84
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,079
so what not the type of ti yeah the

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,280
timex sinclair was one of the very first

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,360
it was a cheap cheap like i think it was

87
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,719
well it was still expensive but it was

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:18,159
2k of memory we got the 16k add-on pack

89
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,158
but yeah it had memory and you could

90
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,000
program it you had the in order to store

91
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,919
your programs you had to attach a tape

92
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,919
drive remember that old the sound that

93
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,719
would play when you invented the

94
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,958
converted the the modems would convert

95
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:33,519
digital bits to audio files on a tape

96
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,120
drive still remember that sound

97
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,400
but that was the storage and what was

98
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,759
the programming language do you remember

99
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,680
it was basic it was basic and then they

100
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,598
had a visi calc and so a little bit of

101
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,439
spreadsheet programming busy but

102
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,679
mostly just some basic do you remember

103
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,680
what kind of things drew you to

104
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,000
programming was it uh

105
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,840
working with data was it video games and

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,080
video games

107
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,400
mathy stuff yeah i've i've always loved

108
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,599
math and

109
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,719
a lot of people think they don't like

110
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,798
math because i think when they're

111
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,759
exposed to it early they uh it's about

112
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,719
memory

113
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:03,840
you know when you're exposed to math

114
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,759
earlier you have a good short term

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,080
memory members timetables

116
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,560
and i i do have a reasonably i mean not

117
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,400
perfect but a reasonably long um little

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,239
short-term memory buffer

119
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
and so i did great at times tables i

120
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,639
said oh you're good at math but i

121
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:20,959
started to really like math just the the

122
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,079
problem solving aspect and so computing

123
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,918
was

124
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,879
problem solving

125
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,120
applied

126
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,879
and so that's always kind of been the

127
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,399
draw kind of coupled with the

128
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:32,159
mathematics

129
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:33,839
did you ever see the computer as like an

130
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,919
extension

131
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:38,799
of your mind like something able to

132
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:40,319
achieve not till later okay yeah no not

133
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,680
then it's just like a little set of

134
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,360
puzzles that you can play with and you

135
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,600
can you can play with math puzzles and

136
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,520
yeah it was it was too rudimentary early

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,199
on like it was sort of

138
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,560
yeah it was too it was a lot of work to

139
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,919
actually take

140
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,560
a thought you'd have and actually get it

141
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:56,799
implemented and that's still work but

142
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,079
it's getting easier and

143
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,600
so yeah i would say that's definitely

144
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:01,359
what's attracted me to python is that

145
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,080
that was more real

146
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
right

147
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,319
i could think in python

148
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,919
speaking a foreign language i only speak

149
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,360
another language fluently besides

150
00:05:07,918 --> 00:05:11,519
english which is spanish and i remember

151
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,280
the day when i would dream in spanish

152
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,879
and you start to think in that language

153
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:16,959
and then you actually i do definitely

154
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,199
believe that language

155
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,399
limits or expands your thinking

156
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,639
uh there are some languages that

157
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,599
actually lead you to certain

158
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,519
thought processes yeah like uh

159
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,360
so i speak russian fluently and that's

160
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,918
certainly uh

161
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,038
a language that leads you down certain

162
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,120
thoughts

163
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:37,120
well yeah i mean there's a um

164
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,240
there's a history of

165
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,879
the two world wars right of the

166
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,038
of millions of people starving to death

167
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,639
or near to death throughout its history

168
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:49,199
of suffering of

169
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
injustice like this promise sold to the

170
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,360
people and then

171
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,759
the the carpet or whatever swept from

172
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,319
under them it's like broken promises and

173
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,360
all of that pain and melancholy is in

174
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,720
the language the sad songs the sad

175
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,439
hopeful songs the over romanticized like

176
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,919
i love you i hate you the the sort of

177
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:12,399
the swings between all the various

178
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,959
uh spectrums of emotion so that's all

179
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:17,198
within the language the way it's twisted

180
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:19,599
uh poach there's a there's a there's a

181
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,478
strong culture of rhyming poetry so like

182
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:24,879
the bards like this this thing there's a

183
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:27,199
musicality to the language too did

184
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,478
dostoevsky write in russian

185
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,520
yeah so like

186
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:30,180
yes

187
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,000
all the uh

188
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:33,918
[Laughter]

189
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,360
all the ones that i know about which are

190
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:38,079
translated and curious how the

191
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,840
translations so dostoevsky

192
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,079
did not use

193
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,079
the musicality of the language too much

194
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:46,399
so it actually translates pretty well

195
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:48,240
because it's so philosophically dense

196
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,159
that the story does a lot of the work

197
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,000
but there's a bunch of things that are

198
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,439
untranslatable certainly the poetry is

199
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,759
not translatable

200
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:58,240
i actually have a few

201
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,000
conversations coming up offline and also

202
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,879
in this podcast with people who've

203
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,879
translated dusty esky and that's in for

204
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,560
people who worked

205
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,000
who work in this field know how

206
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,439
difficult that is sometimes you can

207
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,120
spend

208
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:13,839
you know months thinking about a single

209
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,439
sentence right in in the context like

210
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,119
because there's just the magic captured

211
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:18,800
by that sentence and how do you

212
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,280
translate it just in the right way

213
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,199
because those words can be um

214
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:24,318
can be really powerful there's a famous

215
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,520
line

216
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,960
beauty will save the world from

217
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,318
dostoyevsky

218
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,879
you know there's so many ways to

219
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,039
translate that and you're right the

220
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,279
language gives you the tools with which

221
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:38,079
to tell the story but it also leads your

222
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,478
mind down certain trajectories and paths

223
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,159
to where over time as you think in that

224
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,560
language you become a different human

225
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,240
being yes yeah yeah that's a fascinating

226
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,598
reality i think that i know people have

227
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,439
explored that but it's just rediscovered

228
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,199
well we don't we live in our own like

229
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:54,079
little pockets like this is the sad

230
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:54,960
thing

231
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,519
is

232
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,719
i feel like unfortunately given time and

233
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:04,000
given getting older i'll never know

234
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,000
the uh china the chinese world because i

235
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,959
don't truly know the language same with

236
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,038
japanese i don't truly know japanese and

237
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:13,120
portuguese and brazil that whole south

238
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,199
american continent like yeah i'll go to

239
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,959
brazil and argentina but will i truly

240
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,639
understand the people

241
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:21,918
if i don't understand the language it's

242
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,639
it's sad because um

243
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:27,359
i wonder how much how many geniuses were

244
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,960
missing because uh because so much of

245
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,360
the scientific world so much of the

246
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,278
technical world is in english

247
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,038
and so much of it might be lost because

248
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,038
they're they just we don't have the

249
00:08:35,038 --> 00:08:39,439
common language i completely agree i'm

250
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:40,958
very much in that vein of

251
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,959
there's a lot of genius out there that

252
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,958
we miss and it's sort of sort of

253
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,838
fortunate when it when it bubbles up

254
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:50,159
into something that we can understand or

255
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,800
process there's a lot we miss

256
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:54,319
so i tend to lean towards really loving

257
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:56,799
uh democratization or things that

258
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,640
empower people or you know i

259
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:00,000
very resistant to sort of authoritarian

260
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,159
structures

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,080
fundamentally for that reason it well

262
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:06,240
several reasons but it just hurts us

263
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,560
yeah we're worse off

264
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
so speaking of languages that empower

265
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:11,679
you so

266
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,560
python was the first language for me

267
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,879
that um that i could i really enjoyed

268
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,958
thinking in yeah as you said sounds like

269
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,559
you shared my experience too so when did

270
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,479
you first do you remember when you first

271
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,838
kind of connected with python maybe even

272
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,759
fell in love with python it's a good

273
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,800
question it was a process it took about

274
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,799
a year i first encountered python in

275
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:31,919
1997 i was a graduate student studying

276
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:32,799
biomedical engineering at the mayo

277
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,278
clinic

278
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,599
and i had previously i've been involved

279
00:09:35,278 --> 00:09:39,360
in

280
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,278
taking information from satellites i was

281
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,800
an electrical engineering student

282
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,480
used to taking information and trying to

283
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,159
get something out of it doing some data

284
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,399
processing information out of it and i'd

285
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:50,879
done that in matlab i'd done that in

286
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,958
perl i've done that in you know

287
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,639
scripting of on a vms there's actually a

288
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:57,838
vax vms system and they had their own

289
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,679
little scripting tools uh around fortran

290
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,680
done a lot of that and then

291
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:02,799
as a graduate student i was looking for

292
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,439
something

293
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:07,759
and encounter python and because python

294
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,360
had an array had two things that made me

295
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:10,879
not filtered away because i was

296
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,959
filtering a bunch of stuff as yorick i

297
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,720
looked at yorick i looked at a few other

298
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:17,919
languages throughout there at the time

299
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,600
in 1997 but it it had arrays there's a

300
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,159
library called numeric that had just

301
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,120
been written in 95 like not very

302
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:26,799
not not too much earlier by an mit alum

303
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,480
uh jim huganin

304
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,919
you know and i went back and read the

305
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,120
mailing list to see the history of how

306
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,399
it grew and there was a very interesting

307
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,120
it's fascinating to do that actually to

308
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,200
see how this emergent

309
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,759
cooperation unstructured cooperation

310
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,360
happens in the open source world that

311
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:43,519
led to a lot of

312
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,560
this collective uh programming which is

313
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,078
something maybe we might get into a

314
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:48,639
little later but what that looks like

315
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,639
what gap did numeric fill merrick fill

316
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,838
the gap of having an array object so

317
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,240
there was no array out there was no

318
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,320
array there was a one dimensional

319
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,000
byte concept but there was no

320
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,560
uh n-dimensional two three

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,480
four-dimensional tensor they call it now

322
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:04,239
i'm still in the category that a tensor

323
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,079
is another thing and it's just an md

324
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,159
array we should call it but yeah kind of

325
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,319
lost that battle

326
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,078
there's many battles in this world some

327
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,440
of which will win some we lose that's

328
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,319
exactly right

329
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,120
so and but it was uh it had no math to

330
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,278
it so numeric had math and a basic way

331
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:24,799
to think in a race so i was looking for

332
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:26,720
that and it had complex numbers

333
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,159
a lot of programming languages and you

334
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,399
can see it because you know if you're

335
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:32,719
just a computer scientist you think ah

336
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,799
complex numbers just two floats so you

337
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,440
can people can build that on

338
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:39,039
but in practice a complex number as a as

339
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,120
one of the significant algebras that

340
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,439
helps connect a lot of physical and

341
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,959
mathematical ideas particularly fft for

342
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,079
an electrical engineer

343
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:50,078
and and it's a really important concept

344
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,159
and not having it means you have to

345
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:53,519
develop it several times

346
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,120
and those times may not share an

347
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,240
approach one of the common things in

348
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,879
programming one things programming

349
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
enables is abstractions

350
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,838
but when you have shared abstractions

351
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,759
it's even better it sort of gets the

352
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,000
level of language of actually we all

353
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:07,600
think of this the same way which is both

354
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,200
powerful and dangerous

355
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,680
right because

356
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,519
powerful in that we now can quickly make

357
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,519
bigger and higher level things on top of

358
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,360
those abstractions dangerous because it

359
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,519
also limits us as to the things we left

360
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,120
maybe left behind in producing that

361
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
abstraction which is at the heart of

362
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,480
programming today and actually building

363
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:26,479
around the programming world so i think

364
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,159
it's a fascinating philosophical topic

365
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,959
yeah it will continue for many years i

366
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,319
think

367
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:32,159
as it builds more and more and more

368
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,760
abstractions yes i often think about you

369
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:35,439
know we have we have a world that's

370
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:37,360
built on these abstractions that were

371
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,680
they the only ones possible yeah

372
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,278
certainly not but they led to

373
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:43,199
now it's very hard to to do it

374
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:45,838
differently yeah like there's an inertia

375
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,000
that's very hard to you know

376
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,680
push out push away from there's that has

377
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,519
implications for things like you know

378
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,599
the julia language which you have heard

379
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,600
of i'm sure and

380
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,720
i've met the creators and i like julia

381
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,399
it's a really cool language but they've

382
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,639
struggled to kind of

383
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:03,278
against the just the tide of like this

384
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,039
inertia of people using python and

385
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:06,720
and you know there's strategies to

386
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,719
approach that but nonetheless it's a

387
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,720
it's a phenomena and sometimes so i love

388
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,160
complex numbers and i love to raise so i

389
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,839
looked at python

390
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:15,838
and then i had the experience i did some

391
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,519
stuff in python and i was just doing my

392
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,959
phd so i was out my focus was on

393
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,200
i was actually doing a combination of

394
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:24,879
mri and ultrasound and looking at a

395
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,879
phenomena called elastography which is

396
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,799
you push waves into the body

397
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:30,159
and observe those waves like you can

398
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,439
actually measure them

399
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,039
and then you

400
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,680
do mathematical inversion to see what

401
00:13:33,039 --> 00:13:37,278
the elasticity is and so that's the

402
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,159
problem i was solving is how to do that

403
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,519
with both ultrasound and mri i needed

404
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,039
some tool to do that with so i was

405
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,278
starting to use python in 1997 in 98 i

406
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:49,360
went back looked at what i'd written and

407
00:13:47,278 --> 00:13:50,958
realized i could still understand it

408
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,320
which is not the experience i'd had when

409
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,000
doing pearl in 95. right i'd done the

410
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,160
same thing and then i looked back and i

411
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,159
forgotten what it was even saying

412
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,240
now you know i'm not saying it so i that

413
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:03,838
that means hey this may work i like this

414
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,440
this is something i can

415
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,199
retain without becoming an expert per se

416
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,279
and so that led me to go i'm going to

417
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,399
push more into this and

418
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,838
then that 98 was kind of the when i

419
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,078
started to fall in love with python i

420
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,600
would say

421
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:23,359
a few peculiar things about python so

422
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,199
maybe compared to pearl compared to some

423
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,039
of the other languages so there's no

424
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,479
braces yeah

425
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:31,919
so you

426
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:34,560
space is used indentation i should say

427
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,479
is used as part of my language yeah

428
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:37,679
right uh so

429
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,079
did you

430
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:41,278
i mean that that's quite a leap uh were

431
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,278
you comfortable with that leap or were

432
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:46,159
you just very open-minded good question

433
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:48,159
i was open-minded so it i was

434
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:49,600
cognizant of the concern and it

435
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:51,198
definitely has

436
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,519
it has specific

437
00:14:51,198 --> 00:14:55,519
challenges you know cut and pasting for

438
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,879
example you're cutting pasting code and

439
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,879
if your editors aren't supportive of

440
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:00,159
that if you're put into a terminal

441
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,838
and particularly in the past when

442
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:03,679
terminals didn't necessarily have the

443
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,440
intelligence to manage it now now now

444
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,719
ipython and jupyter notebooks handle it

445
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,079
just fine so there's really no problem

446
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,720
but in the past it created some

447
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,879
challenges formatting challenges also

448
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,720
mixed tabs and spaces if you're if

449
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:16,159
editors weren't you weren't clear on

450
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,759
what was happening you would have these

451
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,759
issues so there were really concrete

452
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:21,679
reasons about it that i heard and

453
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,278
understood i never really encountered a

454
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,599
problem with it

455
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,198
personally like it was occasional

456
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,639
annoyances but

457
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:30,958
i really like the fact that it didn't

458
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,680
have all this extra characters right

459
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:33,198
that

460
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,278
these extra characters didn't show up in

461
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:37,359
my visual field when i was just trying

462
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,360
to process understanding a snippet of

463
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,278
code yeah there's a cleanness to it but

464
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,440
i mean the idea is supposed to be that

465
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,919
pearl also has a cleanness to it because

466
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,680
of the minimalism of like how many

467
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:49,838
characters it takes to express a certain

468
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,519
thing yeah so it's very compact yeah but

469
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,440
what you realize with that compactness

470
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,000
comes

471
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:58,079
there's a culture that uh prizes

472
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,360
compactness and so the code gets more

473
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,719
and more compact and less and less

474
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,278
readable to a point where it's like

475
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,560
uh like to be a good programmer in pearl

476
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,039
you write code that's basically

477
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,958
unreadable right there's a culture like

478
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,399
correct and you're proud of it yeah

479
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,078
you're proud of it

480
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,958
right exactly and it's like feels good

481
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:19,359
and it's really selective like it means

482
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,278
you have to be an expert in perl to

483
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,879
understand it yeah whereas python was

484
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,639
allowed you not to have to be an expert

485
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,759
you'd have to take all this brain energy

486
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,079
you could leverage what i said you could

487
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:30,000
leverage your english language center

488
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:31,039
which you're using all the time i've

489
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,039
wondered about other languages

490
00:16:31,039 --> 00:16:34,639
particularly non-uh latin based

491
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,759
languages you know

492
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,360
latin-based languages where the

493
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,120
characters are at least similar i think

494
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,278
people have an easier time but i don't

495
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,759
know what it's like to be a japanese or

496
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:45,919
a chinese person trying to

497
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,120
learn a different um

498
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,278
different syntax like what would

499
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,959
computer programming look like in a in

500
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:52,480
that i haven't looked at that at all but

501
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:54,239
it certainly doesn't you know leveraging

502
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,079
your your chinese language center i'm

503
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,799
not sure python or any programming does

504
00:16:56,078 --> 00:16:58,399
that

505
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,078
but that was a big deal the fact that it

506
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,759
was accessible i could be a scientist

507
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,278
what i really liked is

508
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,640
many programming languages really demand

509
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,199
a lot of you and you can get a lot you

510
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,959
know you do a lot if you learn it but

511
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,120
python enables you to do a lot without

512
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,480
demanding a lot of you

513
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,639
there's a there's nuance to that

514
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,558
statement but it certainly was it's more

515
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,640
accessible so more people could actually

516
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:19,678
as a as a scientist as somebody or

517
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
engineer

518
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,600
who was trying to solve another problem

519
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,838
besides point programming i could still

520
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,678
use this language and get things done

521
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,960
and and be happy about it i was also

522
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,200
comfortable in c

523
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,038
at that time and matlab you did a little

524
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,798
matlab i did a lot before that exactly

525
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:36,400
so i was comfortable in

526
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,720
those three languages were really the

527
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,000
tools i used during my studies and

528
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,679
schooling

529
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,279
um but to your point about language

530
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,080
helping you think one of the big things

531
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,119
about matlab is it was and apl before it

532
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,159
i don't know if you're a you remember

533
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:50,159
apl

534
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,240
apl is uh actually the predecessor of

535
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,919
array-based programming which i think is

536
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,200
really an underappreciated

537
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,440
if i talk to people who are just steeped

538
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,038
in computer programming computer science

539
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,960
like most the people that microsoft has

540
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:03,279
hired in the past for example

541
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,279
microsoft as a company generally did not

542
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:06,639
understand array-based programming like

543
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:09,038
culturally they didn't understand it so

544
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,480
they kept missing the boat kept missing

545
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,440
the understanding of what this what this

546
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,120
was

547
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,120
they've gotten better but there's still

548
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,479
a whole culture of folks that doesn't

549
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,239
programming that's yeah you know that's

550
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,880
that's systems programming or web

551
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,400
programming or lists and maps and you

552
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,919
know what about an n-dimensional array

553
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,759
oh yeah that's just an implementation

554
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,360
detail well

555
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:28,720
you can think that but then actually if

556
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,399
you have that as a construct you

557
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,759
actually think differently apl was the

558
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,960
first language to understand that it was

559
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,519
in the 60s

560
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,240
right the challenge of apl is apl had

561
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:39,679
very dense not only glyphs like new

562
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
characters new glyphs they even had a

563
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,440
new keyboard because to produce those

564
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,919
glyphs this is back in the early days of

565
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,440
computing when you know the

566
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,799
query keyboard maybe wasn't as

567
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,640
established like what we could have a

568
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,160
new keyboard no big deal

569
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,440
but it was a big deal and it didn't

570
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,798
catch on and the language apl

571
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,558
very much like pearl as people would

572
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,720
pride themselves on how how much could

573
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:04,000
they write the game of life in

574
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,880
30 characters of apl apl has characters

575
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,839
that mean

576
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,039
uh summation and uh they have adverbs

577
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,639
you know they have adjectives and these

578
00:19:09,038 --> 00:19:12,558
things called adverbs which are like

579
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,960
methods like reduction reduction it

580
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,160
would be an adverb on an ad operator

581
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,919
right so

582
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,840
but doing using these tools you could

583
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,840
construct and then you start to think at

584
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:22,959
that level you think in end dimensions

585
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:24,558
it's something i like to say and you

586
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,319
start to think differently about data at

587
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,639
that point you know now you're

588
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:30,480
it really helps yeah i mean

589
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,600
outside of programming if you really

590
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:35,599
internalize linear algebra as a course

591
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,279
i mean it philosophically allows you to

592
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,519
think of the world differently yes it's

593
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,798
almost like liberating you don't have to

594
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,599
you don't have to think about the

595
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:45,519
individual numbers in the n-dimensional

596
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,959
array you can think of it as an object

597
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,400
in itself and all of a sudden this world

598
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,880
can open up

599
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,480
now you're saying matlab and apl were

600
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,240
like the early c

601
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:57,599
i don't know if many languages got that

602
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,440
right ever no no no they didn't still

603
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:01,918
even still i would say i mean

604
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,720
numpy is a as a inheritor of the

605
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,720
traditions that i would say apl j

606
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,558
was a another version that was what it

607
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,240
did is not have the glyphs just have

608
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,558
short characters but still a latin

609
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,880
keyboard could type them and then

610
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:18,000
numeric inherited from that in terms of

611
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:20,080
let's add arrays plus broadcasting plus

612
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,919
methods reduction even some of the

613
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:23,359
language like rank is a concept that's

614
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,480
in that was in python it's still in

615
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:27,038
python

616
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,480
for the number of dimensions right

617
00:20:27,038 --> 00:20:30,558
that's that's different than say the

618
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,558
rank of a matrix which people think of

619
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:34,720
as well so it's it came from that

620
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:37,839
tradition but numpy

621
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,440
is a very pragmatic practical tool uh

622
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:40,959
numpy inherited from numeric and we can

623
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,120
get to where numpy came from which is

624
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,919
the current array

625
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,678
at least current as of

626
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,440
2016-17 now there's a ton of them over

627
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,360
the past two or three years but we can

628
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,519
get into that too so if we just sort of

629
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,079
linger on the early days of

630
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:58,079
what was your favorite feature of python

631
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,678
do you remember like what yeah

632
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:02,399
it's so interesting

633
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,519
to linger on like the

634
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,679
what

635
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:07,679
what really makes you connect with the

636
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,919
language i'm not sure it's

637
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,759
obvious to introspect that no it isn't

638
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,240
and i've thought about that at some

639
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:16,319
length i'm not i think definitely the

640
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,240
fact that i could read it later yeah

641
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,839
that i could use it productively without

642
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,359
becoming an expert and the other

643
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:22,079
language i had to put more effort into

644
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:23,839
right

645
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:25,839
that's like an empirical observation

646
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:27,519
like you're not analyzing any one aspect

647
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,519
of the language it just seems

648
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:31,119
time after time you look back it's

649
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,519
somehow readable it's somewhat readable

650
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:35,759
then it was sort of i could take

651
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:37,038
uh executable english yeah and translate

652
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,480
it to python more easily like i didn't

653
00:21:37,038 --> 00:21:39,599
have to go there was no translation

654
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,679
layer

655
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:43,279
as an engineer or as a scientist i could

656
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,759
think about what i wanted to do and then

657
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,440
the syntax wasn't that far behind it

658
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:49,200
yeah right now there was some there have

659
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,038
some there's some warts there still it

660
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,159
wasn't perfect like there's some areas

661
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:54,319
where i'm like ah it'd be better if this

662
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,919
were different or if this were different

663
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,359
some of those things got out of the

664
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,880
language too i was really grateful for

665
00:21:57,359 --> 00:22:00,798
some of the early pioneers in the python

666
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,559
ecosystem back because python got

667
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:05,519
written in 91 is when the first version

668
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,599
came out but guido was very open to

669
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:09,839
users and one of the sets of users were

670
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:11,199
people like jim hugin and david asher

671
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:12,000
and paul dubois

672
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,919
and

673
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,839
conrad hinson these were people that

674
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,200
were on the main list and they were just

675
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:18,480
asking for things like hey we really

676
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,360
should have complex numbers in this

677
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,120
language so let's you know there's a j

678
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:24,399
there's a one j right and the fact they

679
00:22:23,119 --> 00:22:25,599
want the engineering root of j is

680
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,840
interesting

681
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,119
i don't i don't think that's entirely

682
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:31,439
favorite engineers i think it's because

683
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,558
i is so often used as the index of a for

684
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,159
loop

685
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:35,759
so i think that's actually

686
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,440
probably right i mean there's there's a

687
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:39,279
pragmatic aspect like the complex

688
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,279
numbers were there i love that the fact

689
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,279
that i could write nd arrays constructs

690
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:45,519
and that reduction was there very simple

691
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,879
to write summations and and and

692
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,639
broadcasting was there i could do

693
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,720
addition of whole arrays

694
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,480
um so that was cool those were something

695
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,319
i loved about it

696
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,839
i don't know what to start talking to

697
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:57,839
you about because you've been you've

698
00:22:55,839 --> 00:22:59,599
created so many incredible projects that

699
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:02,240
basically changed the whole landscape of

700
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:04,158
programming but okay let's start with uh

701
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,599
let's go chronologically

702
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,919
with scipy you create a scipy over two

703
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,359
decades ago now yes right yeah i said

704
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,880
i'd love to talk about sci-fi sci-fi was

705
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,079
really my baby

706
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,240
what is it

707
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,038
uh what was its goal what is its goal

708
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,599
how does it work yeah fantastic so scipy

709
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:22,400
was effectively here i'm using python to

710
00:23:21,599 --> 00:23:24,319
do

711
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,159
stuff that i previously used matlab to

712
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,279
use and i was using numeric which is an

713
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,280
array library that made a lot of it

714
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:30,960
possible but there's things that were

715
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,158
missing like i didn't have an ordinary

716
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,319
differential equation solver i could

717
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,480
just call right i didn't have

718
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,918
integration hey i wanted to integrate

719
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,079
this function okay well i don't have

720
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,759
just a function i can call to do that

721
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:43,599
um these are things i remember being

722
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:45,278
critical things that i was missing

723
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,439
optimization i just want to pass a

724
00:23:45,278 --> 00:23:49,359
function to an optimizer and have it

725
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,278
tell me what the optimum value is

726
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,199
uh those are things like well why don't

727
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,159
we just write a library that adds these

728
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,600
tools

729
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,200
and i started a post on the mailing list

730
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:58,558
and they're previously been you know

731
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,679
people have discussed i remember conrad

732
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:01,678
hinson saying wouldn't it be great if we

733
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:03,600
had this optimizer library or david ash

734
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,798
would say this stuff and and i'm you

735
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,798
know i'm a

736
00:24:04,798 --> 00:24:07,918
ambitious i am this is the wrong word

737
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:08,798
and eager

738
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,679
and

739
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:11,519
uh

740
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,200
probably more time than sense i was you

741
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,200
know poor graduate student

742
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,120
uh my wife thinks i'm working on my phd

743
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,038
and i am but part of a phd that i loved

744
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:20,639
was the fact that it's exploratory

745
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,960
you're not just you know

746
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,640
taking orders fulfilling a list of

747
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,480
things to do you're trying to figure out

748
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,320
what to do and so i thought well you

749
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,079
know i'm writing tools for my own use

750
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,399
and a phd so

751
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:35,038
i'll just start this project and so in

752
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,960
99 98 was when i first started to write

753
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,400
libraries for python particularly when i

754
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,600
fell in love with python 98 i thought

755
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
well there's just a few things missing

756
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:44,079
like oh i need a reader to read dicom

757
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,599
files i was in medical imaging.com was a

758
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,519
format that i want to be able to load

759
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,959
that into python okay how do i write a

760
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,759
reader for that so i wrote something

761
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,400
called

762
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,720
it was an i o package right and that was

763
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:57,038
my very first extension module which is

764
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,400
c so i wrote c code to extend python so

765
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,960
that the pos in python i could write

766
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,038
things more easily that that combination

767
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,480
kind of hooked me it was the idea that i

768
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:05,919
could here's this powerful tool i can

769
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,759
use as a scripting language and a high

770
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:09,840
level language to think about but that i

771
00:25:07,759 --> 00:25:12,319
can extend easily

772
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:14,720
easily in c that easily for me because i

773
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:16,079
knew enough c right and then guido had

774
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,600
written a link i mean the only the hard

775
00:25:16,079 --> 00:25:19,359
part of extending python was something

776
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,119
called the way memory management works

777
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,119
and you have to reference counting and

778
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:24,239
so there's there's a tracking of

779
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:25,359
reference counting you have to do

780
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,558
manually

781
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,119
and if you don't you have you have

782
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:31,038
memory leaks and uh so that's hard plus

783
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,399
then c you know it's just much more you

784
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:34,558
have to put more effort into it it's not

785
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,798
just i have to now think about pointers

786
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,240
and have to think about stuff that

787
00:25:36,798 --> 00:25:40,000
is different i have to kind of you're

788
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,679
like putting a new cartridge in your

789
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,038
brain like you're okay i'm thinking

790
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,720
about mri now i'm thinking about

791
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,480
programming and there are distinct

792
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,079
modules you end up having to think about

793
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,599
so it's harder when i was just in python

794
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,359
i could just think about mri and

795
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:53,199
high-level writing

796
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:55,199
but i could do that and that kind of i

797
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,360
liked it i found that to be enjoyable

798
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,038
and fun and so i ended up oh well let me

799
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:00,399
just add a bunch of stuff to python to

800
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,000
do integration

801
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,200
well and the cool thing is is that you

802
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,558
know the power of the internet i just

803
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,360
looking around and i found oh there's

804
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:09,200
this net lib which has

805
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,359
hundreds of fortran routines that people

806
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,080
written in the 60s and the 70s and the

807
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:16,000
80s in fortran 77 fortunately it wasn't

808
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,918
for trend sixties i've been imported to

809
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,480
fortran 77

810
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,520
and 1477 is actually a really great

811
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,079
language

812
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,679
fortune 90 probably is my favorite 4chan

813
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:27,359
because it's also it's got complex

814
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,120
numbers got a raise and it's pretty high

815
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,639
level now the problem with it is you'd

816
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,879
never want to write a program in fortune

817
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:34,559
90 or fortune 77 but it's totally fine

818
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,799
to write a subroutine in

819
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,918
right and so and then 4chan kind of got

820
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,400
a little off course when they tried to

821
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:42,000
compete with c plus plus but at the time

822
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,120
i just want libraries to do something

823
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,200
like oh here's an order different

824
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,719
equation here's integration here's run

825
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,159
cut integration

826
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,600
already done i don't have to think about

827
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,720
that algorithm and you could but it's

828
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:52,719
nice to have somebody who's already done

829
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,960
one and tested it and so i sort of

830
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,159
started this journey in 98 really if you

831
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,519
look back at the main list there's sort

832
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:02,000
of this this productive era of me

833
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,480
writing an extension module to connect

834
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,079
wrench cut integration to python

835
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,519
and making an ordinary digital equation

836
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:09,519
solver and then

837
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:11,759
releasing that as a package so we could

838
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:13,359
call od pack i think i called it then

839
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,119
quad pack and then i just made these

840
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,959
packages eventually that became

841
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,959
multi-pack because they're originally

842
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,798
modular you can install them separately

843
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,159
but a massive problem in python was

844
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:23,278
actually just getting your stuff

845
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,679
installed

846
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,200
at the time releasing software for me

847
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:29,360
like today it's people think what does

848
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,120
that mean well then it meant

849
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,199
some poorly written web page i had some

850
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:36,000
bad web page up and i put a tarball just

851
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,120
a gzip tar ball of source code that was

852
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,200
the release

853
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:43,599
but okay can we just stand that because

854
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,080
that the community aspect of creating

855
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:47,678
the package and sharing that yes

856
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:50,319
that's rare

857
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,840
that to have to both have

858
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,879
at that time so like that was pretty

859
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:57,359
early yeah so well not not rare maybe

860
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,039
maybe you can uh correct me on this but

861
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:01,038
it seems like in the scientific

862
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,480
community so many people you were

863
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:04,000
basically solving the problems you

864
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:07,038
needed to solve

865
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,679
to process the particular application uh

866
00:28:07,038 --> 00:28:11,679
the data that you need and

867
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,919
to also have the mind that i'm going to

868
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:16,559
make this usable for others

869
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:18,240
that's um i would say i was inspired i'd

870
00:28:16,558 --> 00:28:20,720
been inspired by linux i've been

871
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,079
inspired by you know linus linus and him

872
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,278
making his code available and i was

873
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:25,119
starting to use linux at the time and i

874
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:27,679
went this is cool so i had kind of been

875
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:29,918
previously primed that way and generally

876
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,919
i was i was into science because i liked

877
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,840
the sharing notion i like the idea of

878
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,120
hey let's if collectively we build

879
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:36,879
knowledge and share it we can all be

880
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:38,879
better off okay so you weren't energized

881
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,880
by that so it's energized value already

882
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,799
yeah right and i can't deny that i was

883
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,200
i'm sort of uh had this very

884
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:46,319
i liked that part of science that part

885
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,919
of sharing and then all of a sudden oh

886
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:49,759
wait here's something and here's

887
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,759
something i could do

888
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,278
and then i slowly over years learned how

889
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:55,119
to share better so that you could

890
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:56,398
actually engage more people faster one

891
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,479
of the key things was actually giving

892
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,079
people a binary they could install

893
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,360
right so that wasn't just your source

894
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:03,439
code good luck

895
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:05,599
compile this and then get it compiled

896
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,440
ready to install you just you know so in

897
00:29:05,599 --> 00:29:08,879
fact a lot of the journey from 98 even

898
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,519
through 2012 we used to when i started

899
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,399
anaconda was about that like it's why uh

900
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,480
you know it's really the key as to why

901
00:29:14,398 --> 00:29:19,038
the scientists with dreams of doing mri

902
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,360
research ended up starting a software

903
00:29:19,038 --> 00:29:23,519
company that installs

904
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:26,719
software i work with

905
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,240
a few folks now that don't program

906
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,640
like on the creative side and the video

907
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,880
side the audio side and because my whole

908
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,200
life is running on scripts i have to try

909
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,840
to get them to i'm have now the task of

910
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,840
teaching them how to do python enough

911
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:41,278
yeah to run the scripts and so i've been

912
00:29:39,839 --> 00:29:43,199
actually facing this whether it's on the

913
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:45,200
condor some

914
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,360
with the task of how do i minimally

915
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,880
explain basically to my mom how to write

916
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,038
a python script

917
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,720
and it's an interesting challenge

918
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:54,720
it's a to-do item for me to figure out

919
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,640
like what is the minimal amount of

920
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,839
information i have to teach what are the

921
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:01,759
tools you use that one you enjoy it to

922
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,678
your effect of it they're related to two

923
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,519
related questions and then the debugging

924
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,960
like the the iterative process of

925
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:09,278
running the script to figure out what

926
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:12,000
the error is maybe even for some people

927
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:14,000
to do the fix yourself yeah so do you

928
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,919
compile it do this like how do you

929
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,640
distribute that code to them and it's

930
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,000
interesting because i think

931
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,960
it's exactly what you're talking about

932
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,440
if you increase the circle

933
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,960
of empathy that the circle of people

934
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,679
that are able to use your programs

935
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,319
you increase it its like effectiveness

936
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:35,200
and its power and so yeah you have to

937
00:30:34,319 --> 00:30:37,439
think

938
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,600
you know can i write scripts can i write

939
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,919
programs that can be used by biomedical

940
00:30:39,599 --> 00:30:44,079
engineers by all kinds of

941
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,799
people that don't know programming and

942
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:48,240
actually maybe plan to see

943
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,079
have them catch the bug of programming

944
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,599
so that they start on their journey

945
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,839
that's a huge responsibility and

946
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,199
ultimately has to do with the amazon

947
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,519
one-click buy

948
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,679
like how how frictionless can you make

949
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:01,519
the early steps frictionless is actually

950
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:03,120
really key to growing any community is

951
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,159
every any friction point you're just

952
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:06,639
going to lose you're going to lose some

953
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,679
people yeah right now sometimes you may

954
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,440
want to

955
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,880
intentionally do that if you're early

956
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,399
enough on you need

957
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,240
a lot of help you need people who have

958
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:15,599
the skills you might actually it's

959
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,679
helpful you don't necessarily have too

960
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,359
much too many users as opposed to

961
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,240
contributors if the co if you're early

962
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,558
on

963
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,558
anyway there's uh uh sci-fi started in

964
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,240
98 but it really emerged as this

965
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:27,599
collection of modules that i was just

966
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,839
putting on the net people were

967
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:32,079
downloading and they you know

968
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:33,519
i think i got 100 users right by the end

969
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:35,519
of that year but there but the fact that

970
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,960
i got 100 users and more than that

971
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,038
people started to email me with fixes

972
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,319
like and that was actually intoxicating

973
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:43,599
right that was the

974
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:45,200
that was the you know here i'm writing

975
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,038
papers and i'm giving conferences and i

976
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,960
get people would say hello but yeah good

977
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:49,759
job but mostly it was you're reviewed

978
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,600
with

979
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:53,038
it it's competitive yeah right you

980
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,839
publish a paper and people were like oh

981
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,519
it wasn't my paper you know

982
00:31:55,839 --> 00:31:58,798
i was starting to see that sense of

983
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,240
academic

984
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:01,519
life where it was so much i thought

985
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,038
there was a cooperative effort but it

986
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,759
sounds like we're here just to

987
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:07,278
one-up each other right and

988
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,640
you know it's not it's not true across

989
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:10,398
the board but a lot of that's there but

990
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,840
here in this world i was

991
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:12,879
getting responses from people all over

992
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,798
the world

993
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,559
uh you know i remember pierrot peterson

994
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:18,319
in estonia right was one of the first

995
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:19,759
people and he sent me back this make

996
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,678
file because the first thing it is yeah

997
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,839
your build thing stinks and here's a

998
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,440
better make file now it was a complex

999
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:27,678
make file i think i never understood

1000
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,840
that make file actually but it worked

1001
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,759
and it did a lot more and so then thanks

1002
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,240
this is cool and that was my first kind

1003
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,240
of engagement with community

1004
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,480
development but you know the process was

1005
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,960
he sent me a patch file i had to upload

1006
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,640
a new tar ball and i just found i really

1007
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,880
loved that and the style back then was

1008
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,640
here's a main list it was very it wasn't

1009
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,880
as it certainly were the tools that are

1010
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,038
available today it was very early on but

1011
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,600
i really started that's the whole year i

1012
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:55,200
i think i did about seven packages that

1013
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,398
year right and then by the end of the

1014
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,798
year i collected them into a thing

1015
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,719
called multi-pack so 99 there was this

1016
00:32:58,798 --> 00:33:02,079
thing called multi-pack and that's when

1017
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,200
a high school student knows a high

1018
00:33:02,079 --> 00:33:04,720
school student at the time a guy named

1019
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,759
robert kern

1020
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,679
took

1021
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:09,119
that package and made a windows

1022
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:11,278
installer

1023
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,839
right and then of course a massive

1024
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:16,640
increase of usage so by the way most of

1025
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:18,480
this development was under linux yes yes

1026
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,440
it was on linux i was a linux developer

1027
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,360
doing it on munix box i mean at the time

1028
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,480
i was actually getting into i had a new

1029
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:26,079
hard drive he did some kernel

1030
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,519
programming to to make the hard drive

1031
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:28,879
work i mean not programming but

1032
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,558
modification to the kernel so i could

1033
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,880
actually hard drive working

1034
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:34,879
i i love that aspect of it i was also in

1035
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,320
you know at school i was building a

1036
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,640
cluster i took mac computers like uh and

1037
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,918
you put yellow dog linux on them uh they

1038
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,360
were at the mayo clinic they were just

1039
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,960
they're all these macs that were older

1040
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:46,398
they were just getting rid of and so i

1041
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,159
kind of got permission to go grab them

1042
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,158
together i put about 24 of them together

1043
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:51,679
in a cluster and a cabinet

1044
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,240
and put yellow dog linux on them all and

1045
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,320
i wrote a c plus plus um

1046
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,759
program to do mri simulation that was

1047
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,398
what i was doing

1048
00:33:57,759 --> 00:34:03,278
at the same time for my day job so to

1049
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:05,119
speak so i was loving the whole process

1050
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:06,240
at the same time i was oh i need to

1051
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:07,678
ordinary differential equation that's

1052
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,039
why ordinary difference equations were

1053
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,358
key was because that's the heart of a

1054
00:34:09,039 --> 00:34:13,838
block equation for simulated mri is a

1055
00:34:11,358 --> 00:34:15,519
ode solver and so that's

1056
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:16,799
but i actually did that

1057
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:18,000
it doesn't happen at the same time

1058
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,200
that's why it kind of what you're

1059
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,800
working on and what you're interested in

1060
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,319
they're coinciding i was definitely

1061
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,200
scratching my own itch

1062
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,559
in terms of building stuff and uh which

1063
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,480
helped in the sense that i was using it

1064
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:29,759
for me so at least had one user yeah i

1065
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,039
had one person who's like well i know

1066
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,639
this is better i like this interface

1067
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,199
better and i had the experience of

1068
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,960
matlab to guide some of what those apis

1069
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:38,319
might look like but you know you're just

1070
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,000
doing yourself you're building all this

1071
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,359
stuff but with the windows installer it

1072
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,599
was the first time i realized oh yeah

1073
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:44,799
the binary installer really helps people

1074
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,838
and so

1075
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:50,159
that led to spending more time on that

1076
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:53,199
side of things so around 2000 so i

1077
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,200
graduated my phd in 2000 end of year

1078
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,118
2000. so

1079
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,118
99 doing a lot of work there 98 do a lot

1080
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,280
of work there 99 kind of spending more

1081
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,880
time on my phd you know helping people

1082
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,640
use the tools thinking about what i want

1083
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,640
to go from here there was a company

1084
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:09,118
there's a guy actually eric jones and

1085
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:11,199
travis vott they were two friends who

1086
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,519
founded a company called nthot it's here

1087
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:14,719
in austin still here

1088
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,320
and they

1089
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,519
eric contacted me at the time when i was

1090
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,440
a uh

1091
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:20,880
i was a graduate student still and he

1092
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,320
said hey why don't you come down we want

1093
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,760
to build a company

1094
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,119
you know we want we're thinking of you

1095
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,119
know a scientific

1096
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,640
company and we want to take what you're

1097
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,960
doing and kind of add it to some stuff

1098
00:35:28,639 --> 00:35:32,719
that he'd done he'd written some tools

1099
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,559
and then pierre peterson had done ftp

1100
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:36,639
let's come together and build pull this

1101
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:39,358
all together and call it sci-fi

1102
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,358
so that's the origin of the scipy brand

1103
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:42,719
it came from you know multi-pack and a

1104
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:44,400
whole bunch of modules i'd written plus

1105
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:45,598
a few things from some other folks and

1106
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,440
then pulled together in a single

1107
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:48,960
installer

1108
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,119
sci-fi was really a distribution of

1109
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,960
python masquerading as a library

1110
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,599
how did you think about sci-fi in

1111
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,679
context of python in context of numeric

1112
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:00,480
like what we saw scipy as a way to make

1113
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:03,358
an r d environment for python like use

1114
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,639
python uh dependent on numeric so

1115
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:06,480
numeric was the array library we

1116
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,239
depended on and then from there ext

1117
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,639
extend it with a bunch of modules that

1118
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:12,399
allowed for and at the time the original

1119
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:14,719
vision of scipy was to have

1120
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,240
plotting was to have you know replied

1121
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:17,679
you know the rebel environment and kind

1122
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,879
of a whole really a whole data

1123
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:20,559
environment

1124
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,760
um that you could then install and get

1125
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,880
going with and that was kind of the

1126
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,880
thinking

1127
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,440
it didn't really evolve that way right

1128
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,680
it sort of had a but one

1129
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:31,519
it's really hard to do massive scale

1130
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:34,239
projects in a

1131
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,119
with with open source collectives

1132
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,399
actually there's a there's sort of an

1133
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,680
intrinsic uh cooperation limit

1134
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,599
as to which you know too many cooks in

1135
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:43,118
the kitchen you know you can do amazing

1136
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,400
infrastructure work when it comes down

1137
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,160
to bringing it all together into a

1138
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,838
single deliverable that actually

1139
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:50,639
requires a little more

1140
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,599
a little more product management that is

1141
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:53,358
not

1142
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:55,359
it doesn't really emerge from the same

1143
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:56,880
dynamic so it struggled you know

1144
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:58,239
struggled to get

1145
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,680
almost too many voices it's hard to have

1146
00:36:58,239 --> 00:37:02,000
everybody agree you know consensus

1147
00:36:59,679 --> 00:37:03,440
doesn't really work at that scale you

1148
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,199
end up with politics you know with the

1149
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:07,039
same kind of things that's happened in

1150
00:37:05,199 --> 00:37:09,279
large organizations trying to decide on

1151
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,279
what to do together um

1152
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,960
so consensus building was still was was

1153
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,640
challenging at scale as more people came

1154
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,320
in right early on it's fine because

1155
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:17,838
there's nobody there and so it works but

1156
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,440
then as you get more successful the more

1157
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:20,799
people use it all of a sudden oh there's

1158
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,240
this this

1159
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,039
scale at which this doesn't work anymore

1160
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,279
and we have to come up with different

1161
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:28,159
approaches so sci-fi came out officially

1162
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,480
in 2001 was the first release most the

1163
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:31,920
time i remember the days of getting that

1164
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,079
release ready it was a windows installer

1165
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,358
and there was there were bugs on how you

1166
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,039
know the windows compiler handled

1167
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:39,358
complex numbers and you were you're

1168
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:42,079
chasing segmentation faults and it was

1169
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:44,400
it's a lot of work there's a lot of

1170
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,400
effort had nothing to do with my

1171
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,320
area of study at the same time i just

1172
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:49,519
got an offer so he wondered if i wanted

1173
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,359
to come down and help him start that you

1174
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:52,800
know start that company with his friend

1175
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:55,440
and i at the time i was like i was

1176
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,160
intrigued but i was squaring a path an

1177
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,320
academic path and i just got an offer to

1178
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:02,319
go and teach at my alma mater so i took

1179
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,480
that tenure track position

1180
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:06,880
and saipo and kind of then i started

1181
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,960
work on sci-fi as a professor too

1182
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,800
okay so that that's i left i've got the

1183
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:13,039
mayo clinic graduated wrote my thesis

1184
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:15,359
using sci-fi wrote you know there's

1185
00:38:13,039 --> 00:38:16,639
there's images that were created

1186
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,119
now the plotting tool i used was

1187
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,440
something from yorick actually it was a

1188
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,280
plotting a plt kind of a plotting

1189
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,159
language that i used york is a

1190
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,400
programming language it was a

1191
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:27,440
programming language had a plotting tool

1192
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,039
dislin

1193
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,880
it we had integration to dislike i ended

1194
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:32,719
up using dislin plus some some of the

1195
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,680
plotting from yorick

1196
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,358
linked to from python anyway it was a

1197
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,440
people don't plot that way now but this

1198
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:41,358
is before and scipy was trying to add

1199
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,800
plotting yeah right

1200
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:44,319
it didn't have much success really the

1201
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,359
success of plotting came from john

1202
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,880
hunter

1203
00:38:45,358 --> 00:38:48,078
who had a similar experience to my

1204
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,920
experience my kind of maverick

1205
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,359
experience as a person just trying to

1206
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,838
get stuff done and kind of having more

1207
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:56,159
time than than money maybe right and

1208
00:38:53,838 --> 00:38:57,759
john hunter created what not plot lube

1209
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:59,440
he's the creator of map yeah so john

1210
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,480
hunter was uh you know he wasn't a

1211
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,838
student at the time but he was an actor

1212
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,679
he was working in quant field and he

1213
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:04,960
said we need better plotting so he just

1214
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,559
went out and said cool i'll make a new

1215
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,880
project and we'll call it matplotlib and

1216
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,880
he released in 2001. about the same time

1217
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,800
that scipy came out and it was separate

1218
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,440
library separate install

1219
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,480
use numeric sci-fi use numeric

1220
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,639
and so scipy you know 2001 released

1221
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,880
scipy and then m-thot created a

1222
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:24,239
conference called scipy which

1223
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,000
was brought people together to talk

1224
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:27,358
about the space another conference is

1225
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,639
still ongoing it's one of the favorite

1226
00:39:27,358 --> 00:39:29,440
conferences of a lot of people because

1227
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:31,199
it's

1228
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,200
it's changed over the years but early on

1229
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:35,199
it was you know a collection of 50

1230
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:36,639
people who care about

1231
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:38,078
scientists mostly

1232
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:38,799
practicing scientists who want to care

1233
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,800
about

1234
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,000
coding and doing it well and not using

1235
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,359
matlab

1236
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,119
i remember being driven by you know i

1237
00:39:43,358 --> 00:39:47,519
like matlab but i didn't like the fact

1238
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,760
that like so i'm not opposed proprietary

1239
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:52,079
software i'm actually not an open source

1240
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,520
zealot i love open source for the what

1241
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,960
it brings but i also see the role for

1242
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,599
proprietary software what i didn't like

1243
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:59,199
was the fact that i would develop code

1244
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,880
and publish it and then effectively

1245
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,480
telling somebody here to run my code you

1246
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,000
have to have this proprietary software

1247
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,199
right and there's also culture around

1248
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,719
matlab

1249
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:08,318
as much because i've talked to a few

1250
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:10,719
folks

1251
00:40:08,318 --> 00:40:13,199
math works great it's my life yeah

1252
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:14,719
i mean there's just a culture they try

1253
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,679
really hard but it's just there's this

1254
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:19,199
corporate ibm style culture that's like

1255
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:20,639
or whatever i don't don't want to say

1256
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:22,159
negative things about ibm or whatever

1257
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:23,679
but there's a

1258
00:40:22,159 --> 00:40:24,879
no it's it's really that connection

1259
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:26,960
something i'm in the middle of right now

1260
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,599
is is the business of open source and

1261
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:31,199
how do you connect the ethos of

1262
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,640
cooperative development with the

1263
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:34,399
necessity of

1264
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,559
of creating profits

1265
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,838
right and like right now today you know

1266
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,000
i'm still i'm still in the middle of

1267
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:42,078
that that's actually the early days of

1268
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,000
of me exploring this question

1269
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:46,079
because i was writing sci-fi i mean as

1270
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,920
an aside i also had so i had three kids

1271
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,960
at the time i have six kids now i got

1272
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:52,480
married early wanted a family uh i had

1273
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:54,079
three kids and i remember reading i

1274
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,519
remember read richard stallman's post

1275
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,039
and i was i was a fan of stallman i

1276
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,960
would read his work i liked this

1277
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,039
collective ideas he would have certainly

1278
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:03,760
the ideas on ip law i read a lot of

1279
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:04,559
stuff but then he said you know

1280
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,680
okay

1281
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:07,279
well how do i make money with this how

1282
00:41:05,679 --> 00:41:09,199
do i make a living how do i pay for my

1283
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,560
kids all this stuff was in my mind a

1284
00:41:09,199 --> 00:41:12,559
young graduate student making no money

1285
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,400
thinking i got to get a job and he said

1286
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,159
well you know i think just be like me

1287
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,079
and don't have kids right that's just

1288
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:19,598
don't don't that's his take on this that

1289
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:21,039
was just that was that was the what what

1290
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,318
he said in that moment right that's the

1291
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:23,599
thing i read and i went

1292
00:41:22,318 --> 00:41:24,800
okay this is a train i can't get out

1293
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:26,240
yeah

1294
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:28,000
there has to be a way to preserve the

1295
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:30,479
culture of open source and still be able

1296
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,838
to make sufficient money to feed you yes

1297
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,318
exactly there's got to be well so that

1298
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:36,000
actually led me to a study of economics

1299
00:41:34,318 --> 00:41:37,759
because at the time i was ignorant and

1300
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,358
it really was i'm actually i'm

1301
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,560
embarrassed for educational system that

1302
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:42,000
they could let me and i was

1303
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:44,400
valedictorian in my high school class

1304
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,039
and i did super well in college and like

1305
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,720
academically i did great

1306
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,440
right but the fact that i could do that

1307
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:52,559
and then be clueless about this key part

1308
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,559
of life

1309
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,920
it led me to go there's a problem like i

1310
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,759
should i should have learned this in

1311
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,960
fifth grade i should learn this in

1312
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,520
eighth grade like everybody should come

1313
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,960
out with a basic knowledge of economics

1314
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,960
you're an interesting example because

1315
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,760
you've created tools that uh change the

1316
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,519
lives of probably millions of people and

1317
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,440
the fact that you don't understand at

1318
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:13,280
the time of the creation of those tools

1319
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,280
the basics economics of how like to

1320
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:17,680
build up giant system is a problem yeah

1321
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,680
it's a problem and so i during my phd at

1322
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:21,679
the same time this is actually in 98 99

1323
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:23,358
at the same time i was in the library i

1324
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:24,960
was reading books on capitalism i was

1325
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,519
reading books on marxism i was reading

1326
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,679
books on you know what is this thing

1327
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:31,679
what does it what does it mean yeah and

1328
00:42:29,679 --> 00:42:33,199
i encountered a basically what i

1329
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,078
encountered a set of writings from

1330
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:36,239
people that said they were the

1331
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:37,920
inheritors adam smith but adam smith for

1332
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,279
the first time right which is the wealth

1333
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,559
of nations and kind of this notion of

1334
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:43,200
emergent

1335
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,119
emergent uh societies and realized oh

1336
00:42:43,199 --> 00:42:46,559
there's this whole world out here of

1337
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,240
people

1338
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:49,440
and in the challenge the economics is

1339
00:42:48,239 --> 00:42:51,759
also political

1340
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,200
like because economics you know

1341
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,640
people

1342
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:56,239
different parties running for office

1343
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:58,078
they'll

1344
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:59,679
they want their economic friends they

1345
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:01,680
want their economist to back them up

1346
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,598
right or to to be there

1347
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:04,960
to be their magicians like the magicians

1348
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,318
in pharaoh's court right the people that

1349
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,000
are going to say hey this is you should

1350
00:43:06,318 --> 00:43:09,279
listen to me because i've got the expert

1351
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,679
who says this

1352
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:13,280
and so it gets really muddled right but

1353
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,480
i was looking at from as a scientist as

1354
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,760
a scientist going what is this space

1355
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,000
what does this mean how do people how

1356
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,160
does paris get fed how does how what is

1357
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,000
money how does it work i found a lot of

1358
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:23,118
writings i really loved i found some

1359
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,880
things that i really loved and i learned

1360
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:26,880
from that it was writings from people

1361
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,960
like von mises he wrote a pre-order

1362
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,800
paper in 1920 that still should be read

1363
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,119
more than it is it's got i mean it was

1364
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,880
the economic calculation problem of the

1365
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,318
socialist commonwealth it's basically in

1366
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,960
response to the bolshevik revolution in

1367
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:40,800
1917. and his basic argument was it's

1368
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,480
not going to work to not have private

1369
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,000
property you're not going to be able to

1370
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,199
come up with prices the bureaucrats

1371
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,039
aren't going to be able to determine how

1372
00:43:45,199 --> 00:43:49,919
to allocate resources without a price

1373
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:52,239
system and a price system emerges from

1374
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,838
people making trades and they can only

1375
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:55,358
make trades if they have authority over

1376
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:57,440
the thing they're trading

1377
00:43:55,358 --> 00:43:59,519
and that that that creates information

1378
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:02,000
flow that you just don't have

1379
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:04,639
if you try to top down it right right

1380
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,480
it's like huh that's a really good point

1381
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,318
yeah the prices have a signal that's

1382
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,280
used and it's important to have that

1383
00:44:08,318 --> 00:44:10,880
signal

1384
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,560
when you're trying to build a community

1385
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,400
of productive people like you would in

1386
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,000
the software engineering yeah the prices

1387
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:18,079
are actually an important

1388
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,199
signaling mechanism yeah right and that

1389
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,280
money

1390
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:22,639
is just a bartering tool right so this

1391
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,319
is the first time i've encountered any

1392
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:25,838
of this concept right and the fact that

1393
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:28,000
oh this is actually

1394
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:30,078
really critical like it's so critical to

1395
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,119
our prosperity and

1396
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,960
that

1397
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:34,559
we're dangerously

1398
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,318
not learning about this not teaching our

1399
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:37,838
children about this you know so you had

1400
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,119
the three kids you had to make some

1401
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:40,239
stuff how to make some money right i had

1402
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,680
to figure it out but i didn't really

1403
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:44,639
care i mean i was never i've never been

1404
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:47,199
driven by money just need it right right

1405
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:48,960
to eat so what how did that resolve

1406
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:50,799
itself in terms of sci-fi

1407
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,240
so i would say it didn't really resolve

1408
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,079
itself it sort of started a journey that

1409
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:55,759
i'm continuing on i'm still on i would

1410
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,039
say i don't think it resolved itself but

1411
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,680
i will say

1412
00:44:57,039 --> 00:45:01,358
i i went in wide eyes wide open like i

1413
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:04,318
knew that there were problems with you

1414
00:45:01,358 --> 00:45:08,000
know um giving stuff away and creating

1415
00:45:04,318 --> 00:45:09,759
uh the the ex market externalities the

1416
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,880
fact that yeah people might use it and i

1417
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,800
might not get paid for it and i'll have

1418
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,880
to figure something else out to get paid

1419
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,560
like at least i can say i'm not bitter

1420
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,838
that a lot of people have used stuff

1421
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:19,440
that i've written and i haven't

1422
00:45:17,838 --> 00:45:21,199
necessarily benefited economically from

1423
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:22,400
it like yeah i've heard other people be

1424
00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:23,759
you know bitter about that when they

1425
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,079
write or they talk like oh i should have

1426
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:28,960
got more value out of this and i'm also

1427
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,039
i want to create systems that let people

1428
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:32,400
like me who might have these desires to

1429
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:34,639
do things let them benefit so it

1430
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,800
actually creates more of the same

1431
00:45:34,639 --> 00:45:37,759
not to turn on your bitterness module

1432
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,599
but

1433
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,079
there's some aspect i wish there was

1434
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,760
mechanisms for me to reward whoever

1435
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:45,440
created scipy and numpy because it

1436
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,280
brought so much joy to my life i

1437
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,960
appreciate that i mean the tip dark

1438
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,880
notion was there i appreciate that and i

1439
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,800
think but there should be a very there's

1440
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,318
surely mechanism mechanism i totally

1441
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:55,760
agree i would love to talk about some of

1442
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:56,960
the ideas i have because i actually came

1443
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,119
across i think i've come up with some

1444
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,400
interesting notions that could work but

1445
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,079
they'll require

1446
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,160
you know anything that will work takes

1447
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,119
time to emerge right like things don't

1448
00:46:04,159 --> 00:46:06,318
just turn overnight that's definitely

1449
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,280
one thing i've also understood and

1450
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:08,960
learned

1451
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:10,319
is any fixes

1452
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,079
that's why it's kind of funny we often

1453
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:13,279
give credit to you know oh this

1454
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,400
president gets elected and oh look how

1455
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,040
great things have done

1456
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,680
and

1457
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,358
i saw that when when i had a transition

1458
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,279
in a condo when a new ceo came in right

1459
00:46:19,358 --> 00:46:23,759
and it's like the success that's

1460
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:25,440
happening there's an inertia there yeah

1461
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,359
right and sometimes the decision you

1462
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:29,760
made like 10 years before is the reason

1463
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,119
why the successes see right exactly so

1464
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,040
we're sort of just running around taking

1465
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,039
credit for stuff credit assignment has

1466
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,719
like a delay to it yes

1467
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,279
that this makes the credit assignment

1468
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:40,719
basically wrong more than right wrong

1469
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:42,560
more than right exactly and so i'm like

1470
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:44,719
oh this is you know that's the stuff i

1471
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,358
would i would read a ton about you know

1472
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,959
early on so i don't i feel like i'm with

1473
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:50,239
you like i want the same thing i want to

1474
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,000
be able to and honestly not for

1475
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:53,439
personally i've been happy i've been

1476
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,880
i've been happy i feel like i don't have

1477
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,119
any i mean we've been done reasonably

1478
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,358
okay but i've had to pursue it like

1479
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:01,599
that's that's really what started my

1480
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:03,358
um trajectory from academia is reading

1481
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:05,680
that stuff letting me say oh

1482
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,159
entrepreneurship matters

1483
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:09,440
so i love software but entre but we need

1484
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,358
more entrepreneurs and i want to

1485
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:15,760
understand that better so once i kind of

1486
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:17,598
had that that virus infect my brain

1487
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,359
it even though i was on a trajectory to

1488
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,480
go to a tenure track position at a

1489
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:23,199
university

1490
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,199
and i was there for six years i was kind

1491
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:26,799
of already out the door

1492
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,960
when i started and we can get into that

1493
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,240
but yeah um what can i just ask a quick

1494
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,720
question on

1495
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:35,358
is there some design principles that

1496
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:37,039
were in your mind around sci-pi like is

1497
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:39,199
there some key ideas that were just like

1498
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:40,960
sticking to you that this is this is the

1499
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,719
fundamental ideas yeah i would say so i

1500
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,880
would think it's basically accessibility

1501
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:46,959
to scientists like give them give

1502
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,838
scientists and engineers tools they

1503
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,119
don't have to think a lot about

1504
00:47:47,838 --> 00:47:51,039
programming so give them really good

1505
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,559
building blocks give them functions that

1506
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,599
they want to call and

1507
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:54,720
sort of just the right length of

1508
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,760
spelling

1509
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:56,719
you know

1510
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,319
there's a

1511
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:01,279
one tradition in programming where it's

1512
00:47:58,318 --> 00:48:02,880
like you know make very very long names

1513
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,480
right and you can see it in some

1514
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,200
programming languages where the names

1515
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:08,719
get you know take half the screen and

1516
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:10,399
i in

1517
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:12,159
in the 4chan world characters would have

1518
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,160
to be six six letters early on right and

1519
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:15,519
that's way too too much too too little

1520
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:17,118
but i was like

1521
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:19,759
i like to have names that were

1522
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:20,960
informative but short so even though

1523
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,240
python

1524
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,280
well this is a different conversation

1525
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:25,679
but

1526
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,559
documentation is doing some work there

1527
00:48:25,679 --> 00:48:30,799
so when you look at great scientific

1528
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:32,720
libraries and functions there's

1529
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,720
there's a richness of documentation that

1530
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:36,719
helps you get into the details

1531
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,558
the first glance that a function gives

1532
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:40,558
you the intuition of all it needs to do

1533
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,160
by looking at the headers and so on but

1534
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,920
to get the depths of all the

1535
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,679
complexities involved all the options

1536
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,358
involved documentation does something

1537
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:48,879
else documentation is essential yeah so

1538
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:50,639
that was actually a

1539
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,318
so we thought about several things one

1540
00:48:50,639 --> 00:48:54,000
is we wanted plotting we wanted

1541
00:48:52,318 --> 00:48:56,000
interactive environment we wanted good

1542
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,679
documentation these are things we knew

1543
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,559
we wanted the reality is those took

1544
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:00,078
about

1545
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:01,359
10 years to evolve

1546
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:02,960
right given the fact that we didn't have

1547
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:04,159
a big budget it was all volunteer labor

1548
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,679
it was sort of

1549
00:49:04,159 --> 00:49:07,598
um

1550
00:49:05,679 --> 00:49:09,440
when nthot got created and they started

1551
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,960
to you know try to find

1552
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:13,599
projects people would pay for pieces and

1553
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,039
they were able to fund some of it

1554
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:16,559
not nearly enough to keep up with what

1555
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:18,800
was necessary

1556
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:21,040
no criticism just simply the reality i

1557
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:23,280
mean it's it's hard to start a business

1558
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,558
and then do consulting and also promote

1559
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,079
an open source project that's still

1560
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,680
fairly new

1561
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:29,680
cyborg is fairly niche

1562
00:49:27,679 --> 00:49:31,358
we stayed connected all while i was a

1563
00:49:29,679 --> 00:49:32,480
student sorry a professor i went to byu

1564
00:49:31,358 --> 00:49:34,960
and started to teach electrical

1565
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,880
engineering all the applied math courses

1566
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,119
i loved teaching signal processing

1567
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:40,800
probability theory electromagnetism i

1568
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,318
was the if you look at rate my professor

1569
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:43,760
which my kids love to do

1570
00:49:42,318 --> 00:49:45,838
i wasn't

1571
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,720
like i got some bad reviews because

1572
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:48,960
people

1573
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:51,118
what was the criticism um i would speak

1574
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,480
too high too high of a level like i

1575
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,880
definitely had a calibration problem

1576
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,400
coming out of uh graduate work

1577
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,920
where i hate to be condescending to

1578
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,440
people like i really have a ton of

1579
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,000
respect for people fundamentally like my

1580
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:04,559
fundamental thing is i respect people

1581
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,838
sometimes that can lead to a i was i was

1582
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:07,519
thinking they were

1583
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:09,039
they had more knowledge than they did

1584
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:11,199
and so i would just speak at a very high

1585
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,920
level yeah assume they got it but they

1586
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:15,439
need to rise to the standard that you

1587
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,200
set i mean that's one of the some of the

1588
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,240
greatest teachers do that yeah and i

1589
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:20,558
agree and that was kind of what was

1590
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:22,000
inspiring me but but you know you also

1591
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,640
have to

1592
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,239
i i cannot say i was uh i was articulate

1593
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,078
to some of the greatest teachers right i

1594
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,399
was you know like one one classic

1595
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,839
example when i first taught at byu my

1596
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,000
very first class it was overheads

1597
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:35,759
transparencies overheads

1598
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,440
before projectors are really that common

1599
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,400
i saw transparencies i'm writing my

1600
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:42,079
notes out i go in room's half dark

1601
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,358
i just blaring through these

1602
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,720
transparencies here it is here it is

1603
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:47,358
here it is

1604
00:50:44,719 --> 00:50:48,879
and i gave a quiz after two weeks

1605
00:50:47,358 --> 00:50:52,078
nobody knew anything

1606
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,599
nothing i had gotten anywhere

1607
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,200
and i realized okay i'm not this is not

1608
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,960
working so i took put away the

1609
00:50:55,199 --> 00:50:58,639
transparencies and i turned around just

1610
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,559
started using the chalkboard

1611
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:02,078
and what it did is it slowed me down

1612
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:03,920
right the chalkboard just slowed me down

1613
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:06,079
and gave people time to process and to

1614
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,760
think and then that made me focus my

1615
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,559
writing wasn't great on their chalkboard

1616
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,000
but

1617
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,839
i really love that part of like the

1618
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,119
teaching so that that entered scipy's

1619
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,279
world in terms of we always understood

1620
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,599
that there's a didactic aspect of sci-fi

1621
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,440
kind of how do you take the knowledge

1622
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:22,318
and then produce it the challenge we had

1623
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:24,960
was the scope like ultimately scipy was

1624
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:26,318
everything right and so 2001 when it

1625
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,240
first came out people were starting to

1626
00:51:26,318 --> 00:51:29,440
use it no this is cool this is a tool we

1627
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,439
actually use

1628
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,960
at the same time 2001 time frame there

1629
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,960
was a little bit of um like the hubble

1630
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,920
space telescope the folks at hubble has

1631
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,838
started saying hey python we're gonna

1632
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:40,159
use python for processing images from

1633
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:42,558
hubble and so perry greenfield was a

1634
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:43,279
good friend and running that program and

1635
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,800
he

1636
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:46,000
had called me before i left to byu and

1637
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:48,000
said you know

1638
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,079
we want to do this but numeric actually

1639
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,358
has some challenges in terms of you know

1640
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:52,318
it's not the array doesn't have enough

1641
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:54,318
types

1642
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:55,358
uh we need more operations you know

1643
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:57,759
broadcast needs to be a little more

1644
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:59,598
settled uh they wanted record arrays

1645
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:01,280
they wanted you know record arrays are

1646
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,559
like a data frame but a little bit

1647
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,559
different but they wanted more

1648
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:05,920
structured data so

1649
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:06,960
he had called me even early on then and

1650
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,240
they said yeah hey would you want to

1651
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,679
work on something to make this work i

1652
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:11,039
said yeah i'm interested but i'm going

1653
00:52:09,679 --> 00:52:12,879
here and i you know we'll see if i have

1654
00:52:11,039 --> 00:52:14,639
time so in the meantime while i was

1655
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,318
teaching and sci-fi was emerging and i

1656
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:17,679
had a student i was constantly while i

1657
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:18,639
was teaching trying a way to fund this

1658
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:20,639
stuff

1659
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:22,239
so i had a graduate student uh my only

1660
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:23,759
graduate student a

1661
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:26,479
chinese fellow

1662
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,559
luhongza is his name great guy he wrote

1663
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,719
a bunch of stuff for iterative iterative

1664
00:52:28,559 --> 00:52:32,079
linear algebra like got into writing

1665
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:33,759
some of the iterative literary algebra

1666
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:35,920
uh tools that are currently there in

1667
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,160
sci-fi and they've gotten better since

1668
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,159
but this is in 2005.

1669
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:41,838
kept working on sci-fi but

1670
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:45,039
perry had started working on a

1671
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:48,000
replacement to numeric called namurai

1672
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:50,639
and in 2004 a package called in the

1673
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,599
image it was an image processing library

1674
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:55,759
that was written for nomare and it had

1675
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:57,920
in it a morphology tool i don't know

1676
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:59,599
what morphology is it's open dilations

1677
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:01,920
close you know there's sort of this

1678
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,960
as a medical imaging student i knew what

1679
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,358
it was because it was used in

1680
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,119
segmentation a lot and in fact i wanted

1681
00:53:05,358 --> 00:53:09,598
to do something like that in python in

1682
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:12,318
scipy but just had never gotten around

1683
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:14,079
to it so when it came out that it worked

1684
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,639
only on the num array

1685
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:18,880
and scipy needed numeric and so we

1686
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:19,838
effectively had the beginning of this

1687
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,519
split

1688
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,599
and numeric and number i didn't share

1689
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:25,199
data they were just two so you could

1690
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:26,559
have a gigabyte of numeric memory data

1691
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:27,759
and gigabyte of numeric data and they

1692
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:29,599
wouldn't share it yeah and so you have

1693
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,119
these any of these scientific libraries

1694
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,039
written on top

1695
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,880
i got really bugged by that yeah i got

1696
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:36,400
really like oh man this is not good

1697
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,838
we're not cooperating now we're not

1698
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,160
we're sort of redoing each other's work

1699
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:43,039
and we're just this young community

1700
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:45,118
so that's what led me even though i knew

1701
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,558
it was risky because my

1702
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,640
you know i had i was on a tenure track

1703
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:49,680
position 2004 i got reviewed they said

1704
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:51,679
hey things are going okay you're doing

1705
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:52,719
well paper's coming out but you're kind

1706
00:53:51,679 --> 00:53:54,239
of spending a lot of time in this open

1707
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:55,919
source stuff maybe do a little less of

1708
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:57,838
that and a little more of the paper

1709
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,680
writing and grant writing which was

1710
00:53:57,838 --> 00:54:01,838
naive but it was definitely the time you

1711
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:03,039
know the thinking it still goes on still

1712
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,279
goes on

1713
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:08,239
you're basically creating a thing which

1714
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,640
enables science in the 21st century

1715
00:54:08,239 --> 00:54:13,279
right um maybe don't emphasize that so

1716
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:14,719
much in your for your tenure right

1717
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,599
it illustrates some of the challenges

1718
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:18,078
yeah

1719
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:20,880
it does it's and it's people mean well

1720
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:22,240
yeah like but we've gotten broken in a

1721
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:24,079
bunch of ways

1722
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:25,439
certain things programming understanding

1723
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,359
the role of software engineering and

1724
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,960
programming exactly society is a little

1725
00:54:27,358 --> 00:54:30,960
bit less exactly no i was in electrical

1726
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,159
engineering position right so it was

1727
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,039
even worse

1728
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:34,558
there

1729
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,318
yeah it was very they were very focused

1730
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:38,480
and so you know good people and i had a

1731
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:39,679
great time i loved my time i loved my

1732
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,079
teaching i loved all the things i did

1733
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:43,838
there the problem was this split was

1734
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,599
happening in this community i loved i

1735
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:46,880
saw people and i go oh my gosh this is

1736
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,559
going to be

1737
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,798
this is not great and so

1738
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,880
i happened you know fate

1739
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:54,400
i had a class i had signed up for it

1740
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,720
it's a i was trying to build an mri

1741
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,798
system so i just i had a kind of a radio

1742
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,279
a instead of a radio a digital radio

1743
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:03,519
class as a digital mri class

1744
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,880
uh and i had people sign up two people

1745
00:55:03,519 --> 00:55:06,559
signed up then they dropped and so i had

1746
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,358
nobody in this class

1747
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,400
so

1748
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:09,759
and i didn't have any other courses to

1749
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,798
teach and i thought oh i've got some

1750
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:12,640
time

1751
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,719
and i'll just write i'll just write a

1752
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,920
reply a merger of the american memory

1753
00:55:14,719 --> 00:55:18,078
like i'll basically take the numeric

1754
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,039
code base add the features number i was

1755
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,480
adding

1756
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:22,480
and then kind of come up with a single

1757
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,960
array library that everybody can use so

1758
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:27,199
that's where numpy came from was my

1759
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,400
thinking hey i can do this and who else

1760
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,598
is going to because at that point i'd

1761
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,519
been around the community long enough

1762
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:33,680
and i'd written enough c code i knew

1763
00:55:31,519 --> 00:55:35,679
i knew the structures and i in fact my

1764
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:38,558
first contribution to numeric had been

1765
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:40,399
writing the c api documentation that

1766
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:42,559
went in the first documentation for

1767
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,079
numpy for numeric sorry this is paul

1768
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:44,960
dubois david asher connor hinson and

1769
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,559
myself

1770
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:49,119
i got credit because i wrote this

1771
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:52,319
chapter which is all the c api of

1772
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,680
numeric all the c stuff so i said ah i'm

1773
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:54,880
probably the one to do it you know

1774
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:56,960
nobody else is going to do this so it's

1775
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,240
sort of out of a sense of duty and

1776
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,519
passion

1777
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:01,519
knowing that

1778
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:02,798
i don't think my academic advice i don't

1779
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:04,719
think the department here is going to

1780
00:56:02,798 --> 00:56:06,559
appreciate this but i

1781
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:07,598
it's the right thing to do i was like

1782
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:09,519
can we just

1783
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,599
link on that moment because

1784
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:13,519
the importance of the way you thought

1785
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,200
and the action you took

1786
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,039
i feel is

1787
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,279
is understated and

1788
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:21,759
is rare and i would love to see so much

1789
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:24,319
more of it because what happens as the

1790
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:27,119
tools become more popular

1791
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:30,079
uh there's a split that happens

1792
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:33,039
and it's a truly heroic and impactful

1793
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:34,720
action to in those early in that early

1794
00:56:33,039 --> 00:56:36,880
split to step up

1795
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:38,959
and you it's like great leaders

1796
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,680
throughout history like get what is the

1797
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:44,480
brave heart like get on a horse and row

1798
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:46,960
the troops because i think that can have

1799
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,960
make a big difference we have tensorflow

1800
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,960
versus pytorch in the machine learning

1801
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:53,280
we have the same problem today yes

1802
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,199
i wonder it's actually bigger i wonder

1803
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,160
if it's possible

1804
00:56:55,199 --> 00:56:59,679
to in the early days to rally the troops

1805
00:56:58,159 --> 00:57:01,440
it is possible especially in the early

1806
00:56:59,679 --> 00:57:02,960
days the longer it goes the harder right

1807
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,720
the more energy and the factions the

1808
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:07,119
harder but in the early days it is

1809
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:08,798
possible and it's extremely

1810
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,720
helpful and there's a willingness there

1811
00:57:08,798 --> 00:57:11,838
yeah but but but the challenge is

1812
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:13,598
there's usually not a willingness to

1813
00:57:11,838 --> 00:57:16,558
fund it yeah there's not a willingness

1814
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:18,559
to you know like i was literally walking

1815
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:20,880
into a field saying i'm going to do this

1816
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:23,680
and here i am like you know i have five

1817
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,599
kids at home now

1818
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:27,519
pressure builds sometimes my wife hears

1819
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:28,798
these stories and she's like you did

1820
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:30,079
what

1821
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:31,920
i thought we were gonna i thought you

1822
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:34,559
were actually on a path to make sure we

1823
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:36,639
had resources and money but oh wow but

1824
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,319
again there's a there's an aspect i'm a

1825
00:57:36,639 --> 00:57:41,358
very hopeful person i'm an optimistic

1826
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:44,239
person by nature i love people i learned

1827
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:45,759
that about myself later on uh

1828
00:57:44,239 --> 00:57:47,838
part of my

1829
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:49,760
my religious beliefs actually lead to

1830
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:51,119
that and it's why i hold them dear

1831
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,559
because it's actually how i feel about

1832
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:54,318
that's why it's what leads me to this

1833
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:56,960
these attitudes sort of this hopefulness

1834
00:57:54,318 --> 00:57:58,719
and this sense of yeah it may not it may

1835
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:01,199
not work out for me financially or maybe

1836
00:57:58,719 --> 00:58:03,199
but that's not the ultimate gain like

1837
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:04,399
that's a thing but it's not that's not

1838
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:06,558
the score card

1839
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:08,079
uh for me and so i just wanted to be

1840
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:09,359
helpful and i knew and partly because

1841
00:58:08,079 --> 00:58:11,280
these sci-fi conferences because the

1842
00:58:09,358 --> 00:58:12,960
mailing-list conversations i knew there

1843
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:14,798
was a lot of need for this

1844
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:16,798
right so i had this it wasn't like i was

1845
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:18,159
alone in terms of no feedback i had

1846
00:58:16,798 --> 00:58:20,400
these people who knew

1847
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:21,440
but it was crazy like people at the time

1848
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,960
said yeah we didn't think you'd be able

1849
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:25,519
to do it yeah we thought it was crazy

1850
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,720
and also instructive like practically

1851
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:28,880
speaking

1852
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:31,118
that you had a cool feature that you

1853
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,880
were chasing the morphology like the yes

1854
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:35,280
like it's it it's not either the end

1855
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,280
result it's not some visionary thing i'm

1856
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,798
going to unite the community you were

1857
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,400
like correct you were actually

1858
00:58:38,798 --> 00:58:41,679
practically this is what one person

1859
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:43,599
actually could do

1860
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:45,679
uh and actually build because that is

1861
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,359
important because you can get over your

1862
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:48,960
skis yeah

1863
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:51,039
you can definitely get over your skis

1864
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,199
and i had in fact this almost got me

1865
00:58:51,039 --> 00:58:55,759
over my skis right i would say well in

1866
00:58:53,199 --> 00:58:57,358
retrospect i hate looking back

1867
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,280
we i can tell you all the flaws with

1868
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:00,798
numpy right you want to go into it

1869
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,160
there's lots of stuff that i'm like oh

1870
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:03,440
man that's embarrassing that was wrong i

1871
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:05,679
wish i had somebody stop me with a wet

1872
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:08,159
fish there yeah like i needed in fact

1873
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:10,000
what i wished i'd had was somebody

1874
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:11,679
with more experience and certainly

1875
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,358
library writing an array library there's

1876
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:14,558
like i wish i had me i could go back in

1877
00:59:13,358 --> 00:59:16,000
time and go do this do that there's

1878
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,798
important being cause there's things we

1879
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,239
did

1880
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:20,480
that are still there that are

1881
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:22,078
problematic that created challenges for

1882
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,440
later and and i didn't know it at the

1883
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,599
time didn't understand how important

1884
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:27,440
that was and in many cases didn't know

1885
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:29,359
what to do like there was pieces of the

1886
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,200
design of nunpai i didn't know what to

1887
00:59:29,358 --> 00:59:32,400
do until five years ago

1888
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,598
now i know what they should have been

1889
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,280
been but i didn't know at the time and

1890
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,680
nobody and i couldn't get the help

1891
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,960
anyway so i wrote it it took about it

1892
00:59:37,679 --> 00:59:41,759
took four months to write the first

1893
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:43,280
version then about 14 months to make it

1894
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,119
usable

1895
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,240
but it was it wasn't it was that first

1896
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:49,440
four months of intense writing coding

1897
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:50,399
getting something out the door that

1898
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,679
worked

1899
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,280
that was it was it was definitely

1900
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,118
challenging and then the big thing i did

1901
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,760
was create a new type object called

1902
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:00,240
d-type that was probably the

1903
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,000
contribution and the fact that i added

1904
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:04,479
uh broad not just broadcasting but

1905
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:08,318
advanced indexing so that you could do

1906
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:10,480
um masks indexing and indirect indexing

1907
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,639
instead of just slicing in so for people

1908
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:16,079
who don't know maybe you can elaborate

1909
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:19,759
yeah numpy i guess the vision in the

1910
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:21,359
narrowest sense is to have this object

1911
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,119
that represents

1912
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:25,358
n-dimensional arrays

1913
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:27,760
and like at any level of abstraction you

1914
01:00:25,358 --> 01:00:29,920
want but basically it could be a black

1915
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,119
box that you can investigate in ways

1916
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:33,838
that you would naturally want to

1917
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:35,920
investigate yes such objects yes exactly

1918
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,440
so you could do math on it easily math

1919
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:39,680
on it easily so you had so it had an

1920
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,920
associated library of math operations

1921
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,838
and effectively scipy became an even

1922
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,559
larger upright set of

1923
01:00:43,838 --> 01:00:48,318
math operations so the key for me was

1924
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,240
i was going to write numpy and then move

1925
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:52,239
side pi to depend on numpy

1926
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:53,838
in fact early on one of the initial

1927
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:55,519
proposals was that we would just write

1928
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:57,318
scipy and it would have the numeric

1929
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:59,679
object inside of it and it would be

1930
01:00:57,318 --> 01:01:01,279
scipy.array or something

1931
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:02,879
that turned out to be problematic

1932
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:05,359
because numeric already had a little

1933
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,838
mini library of linear algebra and some

1934
01:01:05,358 --> 01:01:10,239
functions and it had enough momentum

1935
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:12,239
enough users that nobody wanted to they

1936
01:01:10,239 --> 01:01:14,078
wanted backward compatibility one of the

1937
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:15,759
big challenges of numpy was i had to be

1938
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:17,760
backward compatible with both numeric

1939
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:19,280
and memory in order to allow both of

1940
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:21,119
those communities to come together there

1941
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,599
was a ton of work in creating that

1942
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,680
backward compatibility that also create

1943
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:27,200
echoes in today's object like some of

1944
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:28,639
the complexity in today's object is

1945
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:30,078
actually from that

1946
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:32,400
goal of backward compatibility these

1947
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:34,400
other communities which if you didn't

1948
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,160
have that you'd do something different

1949
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:37,440
which is instructive because a lot of

1950
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:38,960
things are there

1951
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:41,358
you know what is that there for it's

1952
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,720
like well it was it was a remnant it's

1953
01:01:41,358 --> 01:01:47,119
an artifact of its historical existence

1954
01:01:44,719 --> 01:01:49,759
um by the way i love the empathy and the

1955
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:51,280
lack of ego behind that because i feel

1956
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,119
you see that in the split

1957
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,559
in the javascript frameworks for example

1958
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:59,039
the arbitrary branching right is

1959
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,559
you i think in order to unite people you

1960
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,880
have to kind of put your ego aside and

1961
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:05,039
truly listen to others like you do what

1962
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:07,039
do you love about nama ray what do you

1963
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:08,400
love about numeric like actually get a

1964
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:10,960
sense we're talking about languages

1965
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,639
earlier sort of empathize to the culture

1966
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,720
of the people that love something about

1967
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:15,598
this particular api

1968
01:02:14,719 --> 01:02:19,038
some

1969
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:21,119
some the the naming style or the

1970
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:23,039
the the use the actual usage patterns

1971
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,880
and like truly understand them and so

1972
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:27,680
that you can like

1973
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,599
create that same draw in

1974
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:31,759
the united i completely agree and you

1975
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:33,359
have to also have enough passion that

1976
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:35,760
you'll do it it can't be just like a

1977
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:37,038
perfunctory yeah oh yes i'll listen i'm

1978
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,880
really i listen to you and then i'm not

1979
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:40,880
really excited about it you so it really

1980
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:43,119
is an aspect it's a it's a philosophical

1981
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,798
like there's a philia there's a love of

1982
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:46,160
esteeming of others it's actually at the

1983
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:47,280
heart of

1984
01:02:46,159 --> 01:02:48,798
what

1985
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,480
it's sort of a life philosophy for me

1986
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:52,880
right that i'm constantly pursuing and

1987
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:54,400
that helped absolutely helped it makes

1988
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:56,079
me wonder in a philosophical like

1989
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,358
looking at human civilization as one

1990
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:59,039
object

1991
01:02:57,358 --> 01:03:01,038
it makes me wonder how we can copy and

1992
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,839
paste travis's in the circle

1993
01:03:01,039 --> 01:03:06,400
well in some aspects maybe some aspects

1994
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:07,679
right right exactly well i

1995
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:09,200
it's a good question how do we teach

1996
01:03:07,679 --> 01:03:11,279
this how do we how do we encourage it

1997
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:13,919
how we lift it because so much of the

1998
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:15,920
software world it's it's giant

1999
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:17,838
communities right but it seems like so

2000
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,960
much is moved by like little individuals

2001
01:03:17,838 --> 01:03:23,279
you talk about like linus tarwald

2002
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:25,920
it's like can you could you have not

2003
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:28,160
could you have had linux without him

2004
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:28,798
could you it's like guido and python you

2005
01:03:28,159 --> 01:03:30,239
know

2006
01:03:28,798 --> 01:03:31,838
python i mean the sci-fi community

2007
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:33,118
particularly it's like i said we wanted

2008
01:03:31,838 --> 01:03:35,038
to build this big thing but ultimately

2009
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:36,559
we didn't what happened is we had uh

2010
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,240
mavericks and champions like john hunter

2011
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,880
created matt plotlib we had fernando

2012
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:42,639
perez who created ipython and so we sort

2013
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:44,640
of inspired each other but and then it

2014
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:45,519
kind of there's sort of a culture of of

2015
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:47,679
this

2016
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:49,119
selfless give the stewardship mentality

2017
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:50,558
as opposed to ownership mentality with

2018
01:03:49,119 --> 01:03:53,920
stewardship and and

2019
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:56,480
and community um focused

2020
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,760
community focused but intentional work

2021
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:59,760
like not not waiting for everybody else

2022
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:01,200
to do the work but you're doing it for

2023
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,119
the benefit of others and not you're not

2024
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:03,838
worried about what you're going to get

2025
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,640
you know

2026
01:04:03,838 --> 01:04:05,519
you're not worried about the credit

2027
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:07,038
you're not worried about we're going to

2028
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:08,318
get you're worried about i later

2029
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:09,839
realized that i have to worry a little

2030
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:10,880
about credit not because i want the

2031
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:12,798
credit because i want people to

2032
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,880
understand what led to the results

2033
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:16,239
like i don't it's not it's not about me

2034
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,559
it's i want to understand this is what

2035
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:20,639
led to the result so let's like i think

2036
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,559
doing and this is what had no impact on

2037
01:04:20,639 --> 01:04:24,000
the result like let's let's promote this

2038
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,599
just like you said i want to promote the

2039
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,000
attributes so let that help make us

2040
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,000
better off how do we make more of west

2041
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,519
west mckinney like west mckinney was

2042
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,519
critical to the success of python

2043
01:04:31,519 --> 01:04:34,239
because of his creation of pandas which

2044
01:04:33,519 --> 01:04:36,318
is

2045
01:04:34,239 --> 01:04:38,078
the roots of that were all the way back

2046
01:04:36,318 --> 01:04:40,719
in uh

2047
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:43,039
american number a and numpy where numpy

2048
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:45,118
created an array of records

2049
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:47,039
west started to use that almost like a

2050
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,599
data frame except it's an array of

2051
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:51,039
records and data frame the challenge is

2052
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:53,599
okay if you want to augment it at

2053
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:54,640
another column you have to insert you

2054
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,640
have to do all this memory movement to

2055
01:04:54,639 --> 01:04:58,558
insert a column whereas data frames

2056
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:00,318
became oh i'm going to have a loose

2057
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:03,119
collection of arrays

2058
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:04,239
so it's a record of arrays that is the

2059
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,680
heart of a data frame and we thought

2060
01:05:04,239 --> 01:05:06,479
about that back in the memory days but

2061
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:08,879
wes

2062
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,798
ended up doing the work to build it and

2063
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:12,720
then then also the operations that were

2064
01:05:10,798 --> 01:05:14,719
relevant for data processing what i

2065
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,879
noticed is just the each of these little

2066
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:19,279
things creates just another tick another

2067
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:21,599
up so numpy ultimately took a little

2068
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,920
while about six months in people started

2069
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:27,359
to join me you know francesc

2070
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,880
alted robert kern charles harris

2071
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:31,279
and these these people are many of the

2072
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:32,318
unsung heroes i would say people who are

2073
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,000
you know they don't they sometimes don't

2074
01:05:32,318 --> 01:05:35,599
get the credit they deserve

2075
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,400
because they were critical both to

2076
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,838
support

2077
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,358
like you know it's it's hard and you

2078
01:05:37,838 --> 01:05:41,440
want you need some support people need

2079
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,639
support and i needed just encouragement

2080
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:45,519
and they were helping encouraged by

2081
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:48,159
contributing and and once the big thing

2082
01:05:45,519 --> 01:05:49,838
for me was when john hunter

2083
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:51,598
he had previously done kind of a simple

2084
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:53,199
thing called numerix to kind of you know

2085
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,359
between the american memory he had a

2086
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:59,118
little high level tool that would just

2087
01:05:55,358 --> 01:06:00,880
select each one from matplotlib in 2006

2088
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,119
he finally said we're going to just make

2089
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,798
numpy the dependency of matplotlib

2090
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:06,318
as soon as he did that and i remember

2091
01:06:04,798 --> 01:06:08,559
specifically when he did that i said

2092
01:06:06,318 --> 01:06:10,798
this okay we've done it like that was

2093
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:12,880
when i knew we had succeeded success

2094
01:06:10,798 --> 01:06:14,559
and before then it was still you know to

2095
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:17,760
ensure but that kind of started a roller

2096
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:20,079
coaster and then 2006 to 2009

2097
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:21,839
and then i've been floored by the by

2098
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:23,839
what it's done like i had i knew it

2099
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:25,279
would help i didn't have no idea how

2100
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:27,759
much it would help

2101
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:29,760
right so and it has to do with again the

2102
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:32,960
language thing that just people started

2103
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:35,119
to think in terms of numpy like yes

2104
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:37,358
and that opened up a whole

2105
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:38,640
new way of thinking and part of the

2106
01:06:37,358 --> 01:06:40,239
story that would cut you kind of

2107
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:42,078
mentioned but

2108
01:06:40,239 --> 01:06:44,959
maybe you can

2109
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:47,440
elaborate is it seems like at some point

2110
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:50,159
in this story

2111
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:52,079
python took over science and data

2112
01:06:50,159 --> 01:06:54,798
science yeah and

2113
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:57,599
uh not bigger than that

2114
01:06:54,798 --> 01:07:00,159
the scientific community

2115
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:02,720
started to think like programmers or

2116
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:05,279
started to utilize the tools of

2117
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:07,519
computers to do like at a scale that

2118
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:10,079
wasn't done with fortran like at this

2119
01:07:07,519 --> 01:07:11,679
gigantic scale they started to opening

2120
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:13,119
their heart and then python was the

2121
01:07:11,679 --> 01:07:15,358
thing i mean there's a few other

2122
01:07:13,119 --> 01:07:17,440
competitors i guess but python i think

2123
01:07:15,358 --> 01:07:18,880
really really took over i agree there's

2124
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,240
a lot of stories here that are kind of

2125
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:23,200
during this journey because this is sort

2126
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:24,000
of the start of this journey in 2006.

2127
01:07:23,199 --> 01:07:26,000
so

2128
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,119
my tenure committee i applied for tenure

2129
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:31,358
in 2006 2007. it came back i split the

2130
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,200
department i was very polarizing i had

2131
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:35,038
some huge fans and then some people said

2132
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:36,798
no way right so it was very i was a

2133
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,000
polarizing figure in the department it

2134
01:07:36,798 --> 01:07:39,679
went all the way up to the university

2135
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:41,920
president

2136
01:07:39,679 --> 01:07:43,598
ultimately my department chair had the

2137
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,960
had this sway and they didn't say no

2138
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:46,160
they said come back in two years and do

2139
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,920
it again

2140
01:07:46,159 --> 01:07:50,879
and i went

2141
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:52,159
at that point i was like i said i i i

2142
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,960
mean i had this interest in

2143
01:07:52,159 --> 01:07:57,440
entrepreneurship this interest in in

2144
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:59,920
not the academic circles not the like

2145
01:07:57,440 --> 01:08:01,280
how do how do we make industry work so i

2146
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:03,280
do have to give credit to that expert

2147
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,960
that exploration of economics because

2148
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:07,200
that led me

2149
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:09,358
oh i had a lot of opinions i was i was

2150
01:08:07,199 --> 01:08:11,358
actually very libertarian at the time

2151
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:13,519
and i'm still i have some libertarian

2152
01:08:11,358 --> 01:08:15,519
trends but i'm more of a i understand

2153
01:08:13,519 --> 01:08:18,000
i'm more of a collectivist libertarian

2154
01:08:15,519 --> 01:08:19,920
so you value broadly philosophically

2155
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,759
freedom i value broadly philosophy

2156
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,920
freedom but i also understand the

2157
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:26,479
the power of communities like the power

2158
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:28,239
of of collective behavior and and so

2159
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,039
what's that balance right that makes

2160
01:08:28,238 --> 01:08:31,678
sense

2161
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:33,119
um so by the time i was just i got to go

2162
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,359
out and explore this entrepreneur world

2163
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:38,640
so i left academia i said no thanks

2164
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:40,480
called my friend eric here who had his

2165
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:43,520
company was going i said hey could i

2166
01:08:40,479 --> 01:08:44,798
join you and start this trend and and he

2167
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,400
would at that time they were using

2168
01:08:44,798 --> 01:08:49,039
sci-fi a lot they were trying to get

2169
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:50,719
clients and so i came down to texas and

2170
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:52,880
in texas where i

2171
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:55,039
sort of it's my entrepreneurial world

2172
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,520
right i left academia and went to

2173
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:59,920
entrepreneur world in in 2007. so moved

2174
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:01,520
here in 2007 kind of took a leap knew

2175
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,960
nothing really about business knew

2176
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:07,040
nothing about a lot of stuff there

2177
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:08,239
there's you know for a long time i've

2178
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:10,079
kept some connections to a lot of

2179
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:11,599
academics because i still value it i

2180
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,198
still love the

2181
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:15,120
scientific tradition i still value the

2182
01:09:13,198 --> 01:09:17,358
the essence and the soul and the heart

2183
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:19,519
of what is possible

2184
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:21,920
don't like

2185
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:22,640
a lot of the administration and the kind

2186
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:24,158
of

2187
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,359
we can go into detail about why and

2188
01:09:24,158 --> 01:09:27,119
where and how this happens what are

2189
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:29,279
those challenges i mean i i don't know

2190
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:31,679
but i'm with you so

2191
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,480
well i'm still affiliated with mit

2192
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:37,600
i still love mit because there's magic

2193
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:39,039
there yeah there's people i talk to like

2194
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:40,400
researchers

2195
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:42,158
faculty

2196
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:44,639
in those conversations and the white

2197
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:46,079
board and and just the conversation

2198
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,000
that's magic there

2199
01:09:46,079 --> 01:09:49,759
all the other stuff the administration

2200
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,039
all that kind of stuff

2201
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:51,920
seems to

2202
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:53,679
um

2203
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:56,158
you don't you don't want to say too

2204
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:59,039
harshly criticize sort of bureaucracies

2205
01:09:56,158 --> 01:10:01,679
but there's a lag that seems to get in

2206
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:04,800
the way of the magic yeah and i don't

2207
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:06,960
i'm still have a lot of hope that

2208
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,440
that can change because

2209
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,640
i don't often see that particular type

2210
01:10:09,439 --> 01:10:13,599
of magic

2211
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:17,119
elsewhere in industry so like we need

2212
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:18,719
that and we need that flame going and um

2213
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:20,399
it's the same thing as exactly as you

2214
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:23,198
said it has the same kind of elements

2215
01:10:20,399 --> 01:10:26,319
like the open source community does

2216
01:10:23,198 --> 01:10:28,079
and but then if you like the reason i

2217
01:10:26,319 --> 01:10:30,479
stepped away the reason i'm here just

2218
01:10:28,079 --> 01:10:33,279
like you did in austin is like if i want

2219
01:10:30,479 --> 01:10:35,759
to build one robot i'll stay at mit but

2220
01:10:33,279 --> 01:10:37,840
if i want to build millions

2221
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:40,880
and make money enough to where i can

2222
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,159
explore the magic of that then you can't

2223
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,880
and i think

2224
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:47,439
that dance is um that translational

2225
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,800
dance has been lost a bit yeah right and

2226
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:50,000
there's a lot of reasons for that i'm

2227
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,279
certainly not an expert on this stuff

2228
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:55,039
like an opinion like anybody else but i

2229
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:57,039
i realized that i wanted to explore

2230
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:58,640
entrepreneurship which i knew and really

2231
01:10:57,039 --> 01:11:01,679
figure out and it's been a driving

2232
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:03,600
passion for 20 years 20 25 years how do

2233
01:11:01,679 --> 01:11:06,480
we connect

2234
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,679
capital markets and company um because

2235
01:11:06,479 --> 01:11:09,919
again i fell in love with the notion

2236
01:11:07,679 --> 01:11:12,640
that oh profit seeking on its own is not

2237
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:15,520
a bad thing it's actually a coordination

2238
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:17,840
mechanism for allocating resources that

2239
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,120
you know not in an emergent way right

2240
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:20,960
that respects

2241
01:11:19,119 --> 01:11:22,960
everybody's opinions right so this is

2242
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:24,800
actually powerful so so

2243
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,719
i i say all the time when i make a

2244
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:28,079
company and we do something that makes

2245
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,760
profit what we're saying is hey we're

2246
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:31,600
collecting of the world's resources and

2247
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:32,800
voluntarily people are asking us to do

2248
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:34,640
something they like

2249
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,640
and that's a huge deal and so i really

2250
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:38,159
like that energy so that's what i came

2251
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,280
to do and to learn and to try to figure

2252
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:40,879
out and that's what i've been kind of

2253
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:44,800
stumbling through since for the past 14

2254
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:47,679
years 2007 2007. so you were still

2255
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,520
so no i was just emerging just right

2256
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:50,880
one thing i've done i've done it's worth

2257
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,560
mentioning because it

2258
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:54,239
emphasized the exploratory nature of my

2259
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:55,360
thinking at the time i said well i don't

2260
01:11:54,238 --> 01:11:56,799
know how to fund this thing i've got a

2261
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:58,559
graduate student i'm paying for and i

2262
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,640
got no funding for him and i had done

2263
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,640
some fundraising from the public to try

2264
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,000
to get public fundraiser for my lab

2265
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,679
i didn't really want to go out and just

2266
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:06,880
do the fundraising circuit the way it's

2267
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,119
traditionally done

2268
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:10,400
so i wrote a book and i said i'm going

2269
01:12:09,119 --> 01:12:12,640
to write a book and i'm going to charge

2270
01:12:10,399 --> 01:12:14,639
for it it was called guide to numpy and

2271
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,480
so ultimately numpy became documentation

2272
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,000
driven development because i basically

2273
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:19,678
wrote the book and made sure the stuff

2274
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:22,158
worked to the book would work

2275
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,640
so it really helped actually make numpy

2276
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:25,599
become a thing so that doc writing that

2277
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,280
book

2278
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:29,199
and it was not a i mean it's not a page

2279
01:12:27,279 --> 01:12:30,800
turner i mean kind of not a book you

2280
01:12:29,198 --> 01:12:32,559
pick up and go oh this is great over the

2281
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:34,239
fire but it was it's where you could

2282
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,400
find the details like how'd all this

2283
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:38,639
work and a lot of people love that book

2284
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:40,238
and so a lot of people end up so i but i

2285
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,360
said look i i need to so i'm going to

2286
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:42,799
charge for it

2287
01:12:41,359 --> 01:12:45,119
uh and i got some flack for that not

2288
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,960
that much just just probably five angry

2289
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:48,800
messages people you know yelling at me

2290
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,279
saying i was you know

2291
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:53,199
bad guy for for charging for this book

2292
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:54,960
one of them richard

2293
01:12:53,198 --> 01:12:56,479
no just kidding no i i haven't really

2294
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:59,198
had any interaction with him personally

2295
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:01,119
uh like i said um but but there were a

2296
01:12:59,198 --> 01:13:02,559
few but but actually surprisingly not

2297
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:03,840
there was actually a lot of people like

2298
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,120
no it's fine you know you can charge for

2299
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:06,960
a book that's no big deal we know that's

2300
01:13:05,119 --> 01:13:09,039
a way you can you can try to make money

2301
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,319
around open source so so what i did what

2302
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:11,198
i i did in an interesting way i said

2303
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,119
well

2304
01:13:11,198 --> 01:13:14,960
you know kind of my ideas around around

2305
01:13:13,119 --> 01:13:16,158
ip law and stuff i love the idea you can

2306
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:18,158
share something you can spread it like

2307
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,079
once it's the fact that you have a thing

2308
01:13:18,158 --> 01:13:21,839
and copying is free

2309
01:13:20,079 --> 01:13:24,079
but the creation is not free so how do

2310
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:25,679
we how do you fund the creation and

2311
01:13:24,079 --> 01:13:26,719
allow the copying right and then

2312
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:28,079
software it's a little more complicated

2313
01:13:26,719 --> 01:13:29,520
than that because creation is actually a

2314
01:13:28,079 --> 01:13:31,279
continuous thing you know it's not like

2315
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:33,120
you build a widget that's done it's sort

2316
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:35,519
of a process of emerging and continuing

2317
01:13:33,119 --> 01:13:37,519
to to create but i wrote the book and

2318
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,480
had this market determined price thing i

2319
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:42,800
said look i need i think i said 250 000.

2320
01:13:40,479 --> 01:13:44,799
if i make 250 000 from this book it's

2321
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:47,679
it'll make it free so as soon as i get

2322
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:49,039
that much money or i said five years

2323
01:13:47,679 --> 01:13:50,399
right so there's a time limit like

2324
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:51,600
that's forever cool i didn't know the

2325
01:13:50,399 --> 01:13:53,279
story yeah

2326
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:55,120
i i released it on this and it's

2327
01:13:53,279 --> 01:13:56,479
actually interesting because one of the

2328
01:13:55,119 --> 01:13:58,479
people who also thought that was

2329
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:01,198
interesting ended up being chris white

2330
01:13:58,479 --> 01:14:02,879
who was the director of darpa project

2331
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:04,639
that we got funding through at anaconda

2332
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,319
and the reason he even called us back is

2333
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,000
because he remembered my name from this

2334
01:14:06,319 --> 01:14:09,119
book and he thought that was interesting

2335
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:10,319
and so

2336
01:14:09,119 --> 01:14:12,559
even though we hadn't gone to the demo

2337
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:14,319
days we applied and the people said yeah

2338
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:15,760
nobody ever gets this without coming to

2339
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:17,359
the demo day first that's the first time

2340
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,800
i've seen it but it's because

2341
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:20,639
i knew you know chris had done this and

2342
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,880
had this interaction so it did have

2343
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:24,320
impact i was actually really really

2344
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:27,199
pleased by the result i mean i ended up

2345
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:29,599
i ended up in three years i mean 90 000.

2346
01:14:27,198 --> 01:14:31,359
so i sold 30 000 copies by myself i just

2347
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:33,840
put it up on you know use paypal and

2348
01:14:31,359 --> 01:14:35,359
sold it uh made and those are my first

2349
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:38,239
taste of kind of

2350
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:40,238
okay this can work to some degree and

2351
01:14:38,238 --> 01:14:43,839
and i you know all over the world right

2352
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:45,678
from germany to japan to it was actually

2353
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,360
it did work and so i appreciated the

2354
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:49,119
fact that paypal existed and had a way

2355
01:14:47,359 --> 01:14:51,039
to make to get the money the

2356
01:14:49,119 --> 01:14:54,000
distribution was simple

2357
01:14:51,039 --> 01:14:55,439
this is pre-amazon book stuff so it was

2358
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,198
just published in a website it was the

2359
01:14:55,439 --> 01:14:58,799
popularity of sci-fi emerging and

2360
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:00,319
getting company usage

2361
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:01,600
i ended up not letting it go the five

2362
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:03,198
years and not trying to make the full

2363
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:04,640
amount because

2364
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:06,319
you know a year and a half later i was

2365
01:15:04,640 --> 01:15:07,440
at m thought i had left academias at m

2366
01:15:06,319 --> 01:15:08,719
thought and i kind of had a full-time

2367
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:10,238
job and then actually what happened is

2368
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:11,920
the documentation people there's a group

2369
01:15:10,238 --> 01:15:14,399
that said hey we wanna do documentation

2370
01:15:11,920 --> 01:15:15,840
for scipy as a collective and they're

2371
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:18,559
essentially

2372
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,440
needing the stuff in the book right and

2373
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:21,039
and so

2374
01:15:19,439 --> 01:15:22,238
they kind of ask hey can we just use the

2375
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:25,600
stuff in your book and at that point

2376
01:15:22,238 --> 01:15:27,839
said yeah i'll just open it up so that's

2377
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,679
but it has served his purpose in the

2378
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:31,840
money that i made actually funded my

2379
01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:34,158
grad student like it was actually you

2380
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,920
know i paid him 25 000 a year

2381
01:15:34,158 --> 01:15:37,519
uh out of that money the funny thing is

2382
01:15:35,920 --> 01:15:39,679
if you do very similar kind of

2383
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,840
experiment now with numpy or something

2384
01:15:39,679 --> 01:15:43,679
like it you could probably make a lot

2385
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,679
more it's probably true

2386
01:15:43,679 --> 01:15:47,600
because of the tooling and the community

2387
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:49,600
building yeah i agree like the and

2388
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:51,679
social media there there's just a

2389
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:52,960
virality to that kind of idea i agree

2390
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:54,640
there'd be things to do i've thought

2391
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,399
about that but and really had thought

2392
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,440
about a couple of books or a couple of

2393
01:15:56,399 --> 01:15:58,158
things that could be done there and i

2394
01:15:57,439 --> 01:15:59,599
just

2395
01:15:58,158 --> 01:16:01,119
haven't right even

2396
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:02,640
i tried to hire a ghostwriter this week

2397
01:16:01,119 --> 01:16:04,880
this year too to speak effect would help

2398
01:16:02,640 --> 01:16:06,640
but it it didn't

2399
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,480
part of my problem is this i've been so

2400
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:10,719
excited by a number of things that steps

2401
01:16:08,479 --> 01:16:13,359
in from that like so i came here worked

2402
01:16:10,719 --> 01:16:15,039
at nthot for four years uh graciously

2403
01:16:13,359 --> 01:16:16,238
you know eric made me president and we

2404
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:18,479
started to work closely together we

2405
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,279
actually helped him buy out his partner

2406
01:16:18,479 --> 01:16:21,599
um

2407
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:23,279
it didn't end great like unfortunately

2408
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:25,600
eric and i aren't real aren't friends

2409
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:28,079
now um i still respect him i have a lot

2410
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,679
i mean i wish we were but uh

2411
01:16:28,079 --> 01:16:31,679
he didn't like the fact that i that

2412
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:33,359
peter and i started anaconda right that

2413
01:16:31,679 --> 01:16:35,760
was not i mean

2414
01:16:33,359 --> 01:16:37,279
um so i'm there's two sides of that

2415
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:39,360
story so i'm not gonna go into it right

2416
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:41,359
sure um but you

2417
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:43,119
as human beings and you wish you still

2418
01:16:41,359 --> 01:16:46,719
could be friends i do

2419
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:49,920
i do it saddens me i mean that that's um

2420
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:52,319
that's the story of great minds building

2421
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,960
great companies yeah somehow it's sad

2422
01:16:52,319 --> 01:16:55,599
that um yeah when there's that kind of

2423
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:57,679
and

2424
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,960
i i i hold him in a steam i'm grateful

2425
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,319
for him i think he's they're doing you

2426
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,399
know their thoughts still exist they're

2427
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:04,880
doing great work uh helping scientists

2428
01:17:02,399 --> 01:17:06,399
they still run the scipy conference

2429
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,640
they're in they have an r d platform

2430
01:17:06,399 --> 01:17:10,719
they're selling now that's a a tool that

2431
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:12,159
you can go get today right so

2432
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:14,719
um they've been

2433
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:16,559
thought has played a role in the scipy

2434
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:18,880
in in supporting the community around

2435
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,480
sci-fi i would say they ended up not

2436
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:22,079
being able to

2437
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:24,479
they ended up building a tool suite to

2438
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:25,600
write gui applications like that's where

2439
01:17:24,479 --> 01:17:27,439
they could actually make that the

2440
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,760
business could work and so this

2441
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:31,839
supporting scipy and numpy itself wasn't

2442
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:33,199
as possible like they didn't they tried

2443
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,119
i mean it was not just because it was

2444
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:36,399
just because the business aspect so and

2445
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,479
i wanted to build a company that could

2446
01:17:36,399 --> 01:17:40,319
do that could get venture funding

2447
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:41,678
right better for worse i mean that's a

2448
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:43,359
longer story we could talk a lot about

2449
01:17:41,679 --> 01:17:45,119
that but and that's that's where

2450
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:47,198
anaconda came that's renaconic in it so

2451
01:17:45,119 --> 01:17:48,880
let me let me ask you it's it's a little

2452
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:51,519
bit for fun because you built this

2453
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:54,560
amazing thing and so let's

2454
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:56,560
let's talk about uh like an old warrior

2455
01:17:54,560 --> 01:18:00,080
looking over old battles

2456
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:03,039
um you've you know there's a sad

2457
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:04,800
letter in 2012 that you wrote uh to the

2458
01:18:03,039 --> 01:18:06,719
numpy mailing list announcing that

2459
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:08,560
you're leaving numpy yeah and what some

2460
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:10,719
of the things you've listed

2461
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:12,880
some some of the things you regret or

2462
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:14,319
not regret necessarily but some things

2463
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:16,239
to think about

2464
01:18:14,319 --> 01:18:18,559
if you could go back and you could fix

2465
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:20,639
stuff about numpy or

2466
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,239
both sort of in a personal level but

2467
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,400
also like looking forward what kind of

2468
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:25,439
things would you like to see changed

2469
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:27,359
good question so i think there's

2470
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:29,599
technical questions and social questions

2471
01:18:27,359 --> 01:18:32,000
right there um

2472
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:33,280
first of all you know i wrote numpy as a

2473
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:34,880
service

2474
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:36,000
and i spent a lot of time doing it and

2475
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:38,239
then other people came help make it

2476
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:40,238
happen numpy succeeded because the work

2477
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:42,079
of a lot of people right so it's

2478
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:43,839
important to understand that

2479
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:45,439
i'm grateful for the opportunity the

2480
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:47,360
role i had i could play and grateful

2481
01:18:45,439 --> 01:18:49,039
that things i did had an impact

2482
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:51,039
but they only had the impact they had

2483
01:18:49,039 --> 01:18:53,920
because the other people that came to

2484
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:55,840
the story and so they were essential but

2485
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,679
the way data types were handled the way

2486
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,880
data types we had array scalers for

2487
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:01,600
example

2488
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,760
that that are really just an um a

2489
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:04,960
substitute for a type concept

2490
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:06,800
right so we had

2491
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,960
array scalers are actual python objects

2492
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:11,760
so that there's for every for a 32-bit

2493
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,960
float or a 16-bit float or a 16-bit

2494
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,800
integer

2495
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:17,198
python doesn't have a natural it's just

2496
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:18,800
as one integer there's one float well

2497
01:19:17,198 --> 01:19:20,158
what about these

2498
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,440
lower precision types these larger

2499
01:19:20,158 --> 01:19:23,519
precision types

2500
01:19:21,439 --> 01:19:24,960
so we had them in numpy

2501
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,640
so that you could have a collection of

2502
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:28,560
them but then have an object in python

2503
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,719
that was one of them

2504
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,719
and there's questions about like in

2505
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:34,719
retrospect i wouldn't have created those

2506
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:36,719
of an improved the type system

2507
01:19:34,719 --> 01:19:38,560
and like made the type system actually a

2508
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,880
python type system as opposed to

2509
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:41,840
currently it's a python one level type

2510
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,119
system i don't know if you know the

2511
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:45,119
difference between python one python two

2512
01:19:43,119 --> 01:19:46,640
it's kind of technical kind of depth but

2513
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:48,079
python two one of its big things that

2514
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:50,079
guido did it was really brilliant it was

2515
01:19:48,079 --> 01:19:51,519
he actually

2516
01:19:50,079 --> 01:19:54,880
python one

2517
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:57,199
all classes new objects were where one

2518
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:59,679
if you as a user wrote a class it was an

2519
01:19:57,198 --> 01:20:01,599
instance of a single python type called

2520
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:03,520
the ob called the class type

2521
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:06,560
right in python 2

2522
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:08,800
he used a meta typing hook to actually

2523
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:10,719
go oh we can extend this and have users

2524
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:12,239
write classes that are new types

2525
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:14,000
so it's able to have your user classes

2526
01:20:12,238 --> 01:20:16,319
be actual types and the python type

2527
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,158
system got a lot more rich

2528
01:20:16,319 --> 01:20:19,359
i barely understood that at the time

2529
01:20:18,158 --> 01:20:21,759
that numpy was written and so i

2530
01:20:19,359 --> 01:20:24,238
essentially in python numpy created a

2531
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,920
type system that was python one era

2532
01:20:24,238 --> 01:20:28,479
it was every

2533
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:31,760
every d type is an instance of the same

2534
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:33,519
type as opposed to having new d types be

2535
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:35,600
really just python types with additional

2536
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:37,199
metadata what's the cost of that is it

2537
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,440
efficiency is a usability uh it's

2538
01:20:37,198 --> 01:20:41,439
usability primarily the cost isn't

2539
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:43,599
really efficiency it's it's it's the

2540
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:44,719
fact that it's clumsy to create new

2541
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,880
types

2542
01:20:44,719 --> 01:20:48,239
uh it's hard and then one of the

2543
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:49,760
challenges you want to create new types

2544
01:20:48,238 --> 01:20:52,559
you want a quaternion type or you want

2545
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:55,600
to uh add a new you know posit type or

2546
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,039
you want to um so it's hard now in the

2547
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,039
and and now

2548
01:20:57,039 --> 01:21:00,479
if we had done that well

2549
01:20:59,039 --> 01:21:02,800
when number came on the scene where we

2550
01:21:00,479 --> 01:21:04,319
could actually compile python code it

2551
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:05,920
would integrate with that type system

2552
01:21:04,319 --> 01:21:06,799
much cleaner and now all of a sudden you

2553
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,639
could

2554
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,480
do gradual typing more easily you could

2555
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:13,520
actually have python when you add number

2556
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:14,718
plus better typing could actually be a

2557
01:21:13,520 --> 01:21:17,040
uh

2558
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:19,198
you'd smooth out a lot of rough edges

2559
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:20,880
but there's already there's like but are

2560
01:21:19,198 --> 01:21:23,359
you talking about from the perspective

2561
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,600
of developers within numpy or users and

2562
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:27,359
not buy because developers have new not

2563
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:29,199
really users of numpy so much it's the

2564
01:21:27,359 --> 01:21:30,399
development of numpy so you're thinking

2565
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:32,719
about like

2566
01:21:30,399 --> 01:21:35,039
how to design numpy so that it's

2567
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:37,119
contributors yeah the contributors are

2568
01:21:35,039 --> 01:21:38,639
it's easier it's easier it's less work

2569
01:21:37,119 --> 01:21:40,639
to make it better and to keep it

2570
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:42,639
maintained and and where that's impacted

2571
01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:44,480
things for example is

2572
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:46,639
the gpu like all of a sudden gpus start

2573
01:21:44,479 --> 01:21:48,799
getting added and

2574
01:21:46,639 --> 01:21:50,800
we don't have them in numpy like numpy

2575
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,079
should just work on gpus right the fact

2576
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:54,079
that we have to have to download a whole

2577
01:21:52,079 --> 01:21:56,800
other object called kupai to have arrays

2578
01:21:54,079 --> 01:21:58,559
on gpus is just an artifact of

2579
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,760
history because there's no fundamental

2580
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:01,360
reason for it well that's really

2581
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:03,360
interesting if we could sort of go on

2582
01:22:01,359 --> 01:22:04,319
that tangent briefly is

2583
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:06,559
you have

2584
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,399
pi torch and other

2585
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:11,840
library like tensorflow that basically

2586
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:14,638
tried to mimic uh yeah

2587
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,760
like you've created a sort of platonic

2588
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,880
form

2589
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:18,400
basically

2590
01:22:16,880 --> 01:22:20,079
yeah exactly well the problem was they

2591
01:22:18,399 --> 01:22:22,158
didn't realize that yeah the platonic

2592
01:22:20,079 --> 01:22:23,600
form has a lot of edges they're like

2593
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:26,000
well we should cut those out before we

2594
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:28,079
present it so i i wonder if you can

2595
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,439
comment is there like a difference

2596
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:31,679
between their implementations do you

2597
01:22:29,439 --> 01:22:34,079
wish that they were all using numpy over

2598
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:36,639
like in this abstraction yeah

2599
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:38,960
and sorry to interrupt that there's

2600
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:40,400
gpus a6 there might be other

2601
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:42,480
neuromorphic computing there might be

2602
01:22:40,399 --> 01:22:44,158
other kind of or the aliens will come

2603
01:22:42,479 --> 01:22:46,638
with a new kind of computer like an

2604
01:22:44,158 --> 01:22:49,439
abstraction that numpy should just

2605
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:51,440
operate nicely over the things that are

2606
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:53,599
more and more and smarter and smarter

2607
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:55,919
with uh with this multi-dimensional

2608
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:57,600
arrays yeah yeah i have there's several

2609
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:59,239
comments there we are working on

2610
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:01,760
something now called

2611
01:22:59,238 --> 01:23:03,439
datadashapis.org data.api.org you can go

2612
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,199
there today and it's

2613
01:23:03,439 --> 01:23:07,359
it's our answer it's my answer you know

2614
01:23:05,198 --> 01:23:10,000
it's not just me it's me and ralph and

2615
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:11,519
and athen and aaron and a lot of

2616
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,479
companies are helping us at quansite

2617
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:14,639
labs

2618
01:23:12,479 --> 01:23:18,079
uh it's not unifying all the arrays it's

2619
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:19,920
creating an api that is unified um so

2620
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:21,198
we do care about this and trying to try

2621
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:22,639
to work through it

2622
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:24,879
actually the chance to go and meet with

2623
01:23:22,639 --> 01:23:27,760
the tensorflow team and the pi torch

2624
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:29,679
team and talk to them after uh after

2625
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,639
exiting anaconda just talking about

2626
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:33,760
because

2627
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:35,279
the first year after leaving a con in

2628
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,199
i became deeply aware of this and

2629
01:23:35,279 --> 01:23:38,960
realized that oh this split in the array

2630
01:23:37,198 --> 01:23:41,678
community that exists today

2631
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:44,239
makes what i was concerned about in 2005

2632
01:23:41,679 --> 01:23:46,158
pretty parochial

2633
01:23:44,238 --> 01:23:47,279
it's a lot worse right now there's a lot

2634
01:23:46,158 --> 01:23:49,839
more people

2635
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:52,399
so the perhaps the industry can sustain

2636
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:54,079
more stacks right there's a lot of money

2637
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:55,039
but it makes it a lot less efficient i

2638
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:56,800
mean this

2639
01:23:55,039 --> 01:23:58,639
but i've also learned to appreciate it's

2640
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,719
okay to have some competition it's okay

2641
01:23:58,639 --> 01:24:02,480
to have different implementations

2642
01:24:00,719 --> 01:24:04,158
but it's better if you can at least

2643
01:24:02,479 --> 01:24:05,759
refactor some parts i mean you're going

2644
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:07,519
to be more efficient if you can refactor

2645
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,440
parts it's uh it's nice to have

2646
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,639
competition over things

2647
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:12,479
overweight they're innovative

2648
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:14,079
competition right they're innovative

2649
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:16,718
yeah innovative and then maybe on the

2650
01:24:14,079 --> 01:24:19,198
infrastructure right uh whatever however

2651
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:21,359
you define infrastructure right

2652
01:24:19,198 --> 01:24:23,519
maybe it's nice to have controversial

2653
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:24,719
exactly i agree and i think but it was

2654
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,320
interesting to hear the stories i mean

2655
01:24:24,719 --> 01:24:29,520
tensorflow came out of

2656
01:24:26,319 --> 01:24:31,519
the c-plus plus library uh jeff dean

2657
01:24:29,520 --> 01:24:33,520
wrote i think that was uh basically uh

2658
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:34,560
how they were doing inference right and

2659
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,320
then they realized oh we could do this

2660
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:37,600
tensorflow thing

2661
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:39,439
that close library then what was

2662
01:24:37,600 --> 01:24:41,920
interesting to me was the fact that both

2663
01:24:39,439 --> 01:24:43,279
google and facebook

2664
01:24:41,920 --> 01:24:45,359
did not it's not like they supported

2665
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:47,519
python or numpy initially they just

2666
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:48,719
realized they had to they they came to

2667
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,639
this world and then all the users like

2668
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,480
hey where's the numpy interface

2669
01:24:50,639 --> 01:24:54,719
oh and then they kind of came late to it

2670
01:24:52,479 --> 01:24:56,319
and then they had these bolt-ons

2671
01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:58,319
tensorflow's bolt on

2672
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:01,198
i don't mean to offend but it was so bad

2673
01:24:58,319 --> 01:25:03,198
yeah it's the first time that i i i'm

2674
01:25:01,198 --> 01:25:04,319
usually so i mean

2675
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:06,479
one of the challenges i have is i don't

2676
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:07,920
criticize enough because

2677
01:25:06,479 --> 01:25:10,319
in the sense that i don't give people

2678
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,840
input enough you know if um i think it's

2679
01:25:10,319 --> 01:25:13,840
universally agreed upon that the

2680
01:25:11,840 --> 01:25:15,520
bolt-ons on tensorflow right but i went

2681
01:25:13,840 --> 01:25:18,079
through it there was a talk given at a

2682
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,920
mallorca in in spain and it got a great

2683
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:21,600
guy i came and gave a talk i said you

2684
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,880
should never show that api again at a pi

2685
01:25:21,600 --> 01:25:24,000
data conference

2686
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:25,920
like that

2687
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,198
that's terrible like you're taking this

2688
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:28,639
beautiful system you've created and like

2689
01:25:27,198 --> 01:25:30,479
you're corrupting all these poor python

2690
01:25:28,639 --> 01:25:32,159
people forcing them to write code like

2691
01:25:30,479 --> 01:25:34,319
that or thinking they should

2692
01:25:32,158 --> 01:25:36,319
uh fortunately you know they adopted

2693
01:25:34,319 --> 01:25:38,880
keras as their and that's keros is

2694
01:25:36,319 --> 01:25:42,479
better and so keras tensorflow is fine

2695
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:44,880
is reasonable but um they bolted it on

2696
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:45,678
facebook did too like facebook had their

2697
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,079
own

2698
01:25:45,679 --> 01:25:49,920
c plus library for doing inference and

2699
01:25:48,079 --> 01:25:52,000
they also had the same you know reaction

2700
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:53,440
they had to do this one big difference

2701
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,279
is facebook maybe because the way it's

2702
01:25:53,439 --> 01:25:57,439
situated in the in part of fair part of

2703
01:25:55,279 --> 01:25:59,119
the research library tensorflow is

2704
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:00,559
definitely used and you know they have

2705
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:02,479
to make they couldn't just open it up

2706
01:26:00,560 --> 01:26:03,760
and let the community you know change

2707
01:26:02,479 --> 01:26:04,718
what that is because

2708
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,719
i guess they were worried about

2709
01:26:04,719 --> 01:26:09,439
disrupting their operations

2710
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:12,239
facebook's been much more open to having

2711
01:26:09,439 --> 01:26:14,238
community input on the structure itself

2712
01:26:12,238 --> 01:26:15,439
whereas google and tensorflow they're

2713
01:26:14,238 --> 01:26:16,879
really eager to have user community

2714
01:26:15,439 --> 01:26:18,638
users people use it and build the

2715
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,560
infrastructure but it's much more wild

2716
01:26:18,639 --> 01:26:23,039
like it's harder to become a contributor

2717
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:25,520
to tensorflow and it's also this is very

2718
01:26:23,039 --> 01:26:27,198
difficult question to answer and i don't

2719
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,280
mean to be throwing shade at anybody but

2720
01:26:27,198 --> 01:26:30,158
you have to wonder it's the microsoft

2721
01:26:29,279 --> 01:26:32,559
question

2722
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:33,839
of when you have a tool like pi torch or

2723
01:26:32,560 --> 01:26:36,159
tensorflow

2724
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:38,000
how much are you tending to the hackers

2725
01:26:36,158 --> 01:26:40,879
and how much are you tending to the big

2726
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,119
corporate clients correct and so correct

2727
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:44,639
like the ones that so do you tend to the

2728
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:46,238
millions of people that are giving you

2729
01:26:44,639 --> 01:26:48,319
almost no money

2730
01:26:46,238 --> 01:26:51,519
or do you tend to the peop the few that

2731
01:26:48,319 --> 01:26:52,479
are giving you a ton of money i tend to

2732
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:54,639
um

2733
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:57,599
stand with the people right because i

2734
01:26:54,639 --> 01:26:59,520
feel like if you uh nurture the hackers

2735
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:01,520
you will make the right decisions in the

2736
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:03,280
long term that will make the companies

2737
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:05,040
happy i lean that way too

2738
01:27:03,279 --> 01:27:06,880
totally but then you have to find the

2739
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:08,000
right date but it's a balance yeah it's

2740
01:27:06,880 --> 01:27:10,159
because you can lean to the hackers and

2741
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,359
run out of money yeah exactly

2742
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,719
exactly

2743
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:15,359
which has been some of the challenge

2744
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:16,480
i've faced yes in the sense that like i

2745
01:27:15,359 --> 01:27:18,319
like i would look at some of the

2746
01:27:16,479 --> 01:27:20,479
experiments like numpy the fact that we

2747
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:21,840
have the split is a factor of i wasn't

2748
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:24,479
able to collect more money towards

2749
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:26,480
number development yeah right i mean i

2750
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:28,959
didn't succeed at in the early days of

2751
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:30,959
getting enough financial contribution

2752
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:32,319
and umpi so maybe i could work on it

2753
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,679
right i couldn't work on it full-time i

2754
01:27:32,319 --> 01:27:35,679
had to just

2755
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:38,000
catch an hour here an hour there

2756
01:27:35,679 --> 01:27:39,520
and i've basically not liked that like

2757
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,880
i've wanted to be able to do something

2758
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,800
about that for a long time and trying to

2759
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:44,560
figure out how well there's lots of ways

2760
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,480
i mean possibly one could say you know

2761
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,960
we had an offer from microsoft at early

2762
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:50,959
days of anaconda uh the 2014 they

2763
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:52,239
offered to come by us right

2764
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:53,520
the problem was the right people that

2765
01:27:52,238 --> 01:27:54,959
microsoft didn't offer to buy us and

2766
01:27:53,520 --> 01:27:56,880
they were still

2767
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:57,920
they were it was really uh we were like

2768
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,119
a second

2769
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:01,840
they had really bought they just bought

2770
01:27:59,119 --> 01:28:03,840
r the r company called um

2771
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:06,560
it was not our studio but it was another

2772
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,079
r company that was emergent and it was

2773
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:10,080
kind of a well we should also get a

2774
01:28:08,079 --> 01:28:11,439
python play but they were really

2775
01:28:10,079 --> 01:28:13,359
doubling down on r

2776
01:28:11,439 --> 01:28:14,960
right and so it was like it was where

2777
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:17,119
you would go to die so it's not it

2778
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:19,198
wasn't it was before satya was there

2779
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:20,880
satya had just started just started

2780
01:28:19,198 --> 01:28:22,719
right and if the and the offer was

2781
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:25,600
coming from someone two levels down from

2782
01:28:22,719 --> 01:28:27,279
him gotcha right and if it come from

2783
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:30,000
scott guthrie so i got a chance to meet

2784
01:28:27,279 --> 01:28:31,439
scott guthrie great guy i like him if it

2785
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:33,119
offered to come from him

2786
01:28:31,439 --> 01:28:34,879
probably would be at microsoft right now

2787
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:37,198
that'd be fascinating that would be

2788
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:38,880
really nice actually especially given uh

2789
01:28:37,198 --> 01:28:40,879
what microsoft has since done for the

2790
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,319
open source community yes i think

2791
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:43,920
they're doing well i really like some of

2792
01:28:42,319 --> 01:28:45,519
the stuff they've been doing they're

2793
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,560
still working and they've you know

2794
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:50,080
they've hired guido now and they've

2795
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:50,080
hired a lot of python developers

2796
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,520
he retired then he came out of

2797
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:56,559
retirement and he's working out i was

2798
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,560
just talking to him and he didn't

2799
01:28:56,560 --> 01:29:01,280
mention this person well

2800
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:02,800
i should i should have been further

2801
01:29:01,279 --> 01:29:04,800
because i know he loved dropbox but i

2802
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:06,000
wasn't sure what he was doing who he was

2803
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:07,760
up to well he was kind of saying he'd

2804
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,880
retire but uh and it's it's literally

2805
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,880
been

2806
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:13,520
five years since i last sat down and

2807
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:15,920
really talked to guido right um

2808
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:18,159
guido is a technology uh expert right

2809
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:19,440
he's a so i i came i was excited because

2810
01:29:18,158 --> 01:29:21,359
i'd finally figure out the type system

2811
01:29:19,439 --> 01:29:22,799
for numbai i wanted to kind of talk

2812
01:29:21,359 --> 01:29:24,639
about that with him and i kind of

2813
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:26,960
overwhelmed him could you stay in that

2814
01:29:24,639 --> 01:29:28,239
mo just for a brief moment because

2815
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:29,840
you're a fascinating person in the

2816
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:33,039
history of program and he is a

2817
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:35,360
fascinating person what have you learned

2818
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:38,319
from guido about

2819
01:29:35,359 --> 01:29:40,719
programming about life yeah yeah uh a

2820
01:29:38,319 --> 01:29:42,960
lot actually i've been a fan of guidos

2821
01:29:40,719 --> 01:29:44,239
you know we have a chance to talk some i

2822
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,639
wouldn't say you know we talk all the

2823
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:49,039
time not only at all he may um but we

2824
01:29:46,639 --> 01:29:50,159
talked enough to i respect his back when

2825
01:29:49,039 --> 01:29:52,079
i first started number one the first

2826
01:29:50,158 --> 01:29:54,238
things i did was i had a i asked guido

2827
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:56,479
for a meeting with him and paul dubois

2828
01:29:54,238 --> 01:29:58,479
in san mateo and i went and met him for

2829
01:29:56,479 --> 01:30:00,718
lunch and basically to say maybe we can

2830
01:29:58,479 --> 01:30:02,799
actually part of the strategy for numpy

2831
01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,960
was to get it into python 3 and maybe be

2832
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,960
part of python so we talked about that

2833
01:30:04,960 --> 01:30:08,480
that's cool about that approach right i

2834
01:30:06,960 --> 01:30:10,560
would have loved to be a fly in the

2835
01:30:08,479 --> 01:30:13,519
world that was a that was good and over

2836
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:16,400
over the years for guido i learned

2837
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:18,159
so he was open like he was willing to

2838
01:30:16,399 --> 01:30:19,759
listen to people's ideas

2839
01:30:18,158 --> 01:30:21,359
right and know over the years now

2840
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:23,280
generally you know i'm not saying

2841
01:30:21,359 --> 01:30:24,639
universally that's been true but but

2842
01:30:23,279 --> 01:30:27,039
generally that's been true so he's

2843
01:30:24,639 --> 01:30:28,400
willing to listen he's willing to defer

2844
01:30:27,039 --> 01:30:29,359
like on the scientific side he would

2845
01:30:28,399 --> 01:30:30,960
just kind of defer he didn't really

2846
01:30:29,359 --> 01:30:33,759
always understand what we were doing

2847
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:35,520
like and he'd defer one place where he

2848
01:30:33,760 --> 01:30:37,600
didn't enough

2849
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:39,520
was we missed a matrix multiply operator

2850
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:41,360
like that finally got added to python

2851
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,080
but about 10 years later than it should

2852
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:44,639
have

2853
01:30:42,079 --> 01:30:46,319
but the reason was because nobody

2854
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:48,159
it took it takes a lot of effort and i

2855
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:50,079
learned this while i was writing numpy i

2856
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:52,158
also wrote tools to give a python dev

2857
01:30:50,079 --> 01:30:53,920
and i added some pieces of python um

2858
01:30:52,158 --> 01:30:55,759
like the memory view object i wanted the

2859
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:57,199
structure of numpy into python so we

2860
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:59,360
didn't get numpy into python but we got

2861
01:30:57,198 --> 01:31:01,359
the basic structure of it in the python

2862
01:30:59,359 --> 01:31:03,039
like so you could build on it nobody did

2863
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:04,559
for a while but eventually database

2864
01:31:03,039 --> 01:31:06,000
authors started to

2865
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:08,960
and it was it's a lot better they did

2866
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:10,719
and also antoine petro and stefan craw

2867
01:31:08,960 --> 01:31:12,079
actually fixed the memory view object

2868
01:31:10,719 --> 01:31:14,000
because i wrote the underlying

2869
01:31:12,079 --> 01:31:16,079
infrastructure in c but the python

2870
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,359
exposure was terrible until they came in

2871
01:31:16,079 --> 01:31:19,519
and fixed it partly because i was

2872
01:31:17,359 --> 01:31:21,198
writing numpy and numpy was the python

2873
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,040
exposure i didn't really care about if

2874
01:31:21,198 --> 01:31:24,000
you didn't have numpy installed anyway

2875
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:26,719
guido

2876
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:28,238
opened up ideas technology you know

2877
01:31:26,719 --> 01:31:29,359
brilliant like really

2878
01:31:28,238 --> 01:31:31,279
i really got a lot of respect for him

2879
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:33,198
when i saw what he did with the clap

2880
01:31:31,279 --> 01:31:36,000
with the this type class merger thing

2881
01:31:33,198 --> 01:31:37,599
that was actually tricky right and then

2882
01:31:36,000 --> 01:31:39,439
and then willing to share willing to

2883
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:41,199
share his ideas so the other thing early

2884
01:31:39,439 --> 01:31:42,879
on in 1998 i said i start wrote my first

2885
01:31:41,198 --> 01:31:45,039
extension module the reason i could is

2886
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:46,960
because he wrote this blog post on how

2887
01:31:45,039 --> 01:31:48,800
to do reference counting

2888
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:51,198
right and without it i would have been

2889
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:53,279
lost right but he was he was willing to

2890
01:31:51,198 --> 01:31:54,879
at least try to write this post and so

2891
01:31:53,279 --> 01:31:56,800
he's been motive he's been motivated

2892
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,560
early on with python it was a computer

2893
01:31:56,800 --> 01:32:00,320
science for everybody we kind of have

2894
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,679
this early on desire to oh maybe we

2895
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:03,279
should be pushing programming to more

2896
01:32:01,679 --> 01:32:05,039
people so he had this

2897
01:32:03,279 --> 01:32:05,920
populist notion i guess or populist

2898
01:32:05,039 --> 01:32:08,639
sense

2899
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:10,480
um so learn that there's a certain skill

2900
01:32:08,639 --> 01:32:11,199
i've seen it in other people too

2901
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:13,359
of

2902
01:32:11,198 --> 01:32:15,439
engaging with contributors sufficiently

2903
01:32:13,359 --> 01:32:16,399
to because when somebody engages with

2904
01:32:15,439 --> 01:32:18,719
you and wants to contribute to you if

2905
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:20,399
you ignore them they go away so building

2906
01:32:18,719 --> 01:32:21,840
that early contributor base requires

2907
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:24,399
real engagement

2908
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:27,199
with other people and he would do that

2909
01:32:24,399 --> 01:32:30,238
can you also comment on this tragic

2910
01:32:27,198 --> 01:32:32,799
uh stepping down from his position as

2911
01:32:30,238 --> 01:32:34,399
the benevolent dictator for life

2912
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:36,639
over the wars

2913
01:32:34,399 --> 01:32:39,119
uh uh you know the walrus operator the

2914
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:40,800
walrus operator was the bat last battle

2915
01:32:39,119 --> 01:32:42,960
i don't know if that's the cause of it

2916
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:44,560
but uh this there's this for people who

2917
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,119
don't know you can look up there's the

2918
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:50,320
walrus operator which is uh looks like a

2919
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:52,079
colon and an equal sign yeah and equal

2920
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:53,759
sign and

2921
01:32:52,079 --> 01:32:55,519
it actually does

2922
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:58,480
maybe the thing that you

2923
01:32:55,520 --> 01:33:00,560
that an equal sign should be doing yeah

2924
01:32:58,479 --> 01:33:02,959
maybe right exactly uh yeah but it's

2925
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:05,280
just historically equal sign means

2926
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:07,840
something else it just means assignment

2927
01:33:05,279 --> 01:33:10,479
so he stepped down over this what do you

2928
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:11,679
think about the pressure of leadership

2929
01:33:10,479 --> 01:33:14,000
some of the you mentioned the letter i

2930
01:33:11,679 --> 01:33:15,920
wrote in umpire at the time that was a

2931
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,198
hard time actually i mean you know

2932
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,520
there's been really hard times it was

2933
01:33:17,198 --> 01:33:21,119
hard you know

2934
01:33:19,520 --> 01:33:23,040
you get criticized right and you get

2935
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:24,399
pushed and you get um not everybody

2936
01:33:23,039 --> 01:33:26,719
loves what you do like anytime you do

2937
01:33:24,399 --> 01:33:28,559
anything that has impact at all

2938
01:33:26,719 --> 01:33:30,399
you're not universally loved right you

2939
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,880
get some real critics and

2940
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:34,319
that's an important energy because

2941
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:37,119
it's impossible if you do everything

2942
01:33:34,319 --> 01:33:39,198
right you need people to be pushing but

2943
01:33:37,119 --> 01:33:40,319
sometimes people can get mean yeah

2944
01:33:39,198 --> 01:33:41,039
people can

2945
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:42,399
i

2946
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:43,920
i prefer to get people to benefit the

2947
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:45,679
doubt i don't immediately assume they

2948
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:47,279
have bad intentions

2949
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:48,639
and maybe for other you know maybe other

2950
01:33:47,279 --> 01:33:50,079
maybe that doesn't happen for everybody

2951
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:51,440
they for whatever reason their past

2952
01:33:50,079 --> 01:33:53,119
their experience with people they they

2953
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:54,238
sometimes have bad and they so they

2954
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:55,599
immediately attribute to you bad

2955
01:33:54,238 --> 01:33:57,198
intentions so you're like where this

2956
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:58,400
come from i mean i definitely open the

2957
01:33:57,198 --> 01:34:00,238
criticism but i think you're

2958
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:01,759
misinterpreting the whole point

2959
01:34:00,238 --> 01:34:03,678
uh because i i would get that you know

2960
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,400
certainly when i started anaconda you

2961
01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,679
know

2962
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:08,319
i've been

2963
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:09,760
sometimes i say to people uh i know i'm

2964
01:34:08,319 --> 01:34:10,799
i care enough about entrepreneurship to

2965
01:34:09,760 --> 01:34:12,079
make some open source people

2966
01:34:10,800 --> 01:34:13,600
uncomfortable

2967
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:15,439
and i care enough about open source to

2968
01:34:13,600 --> 01:34:18,239
make investors uncomfortable

2969
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:20,079
so i sort of you know create you create

2970
01:34:18,238 --> 01:34:22,718
kind of doubters on both sides so when

2971
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:25,920
you have and this is just a

2972
01:34:22,719 --> 01:34:27,600
a plea to the listener and the public

2973
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:28,560
i've noticed this too

2974
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,719
that

2975
01:34:28,560 --> 01:34:32,639
there's a tendency and social media

2976
01:34:30,719 --> 01:34:34,560
makes this worse

2977
01:34:32,639 --> 01:34:36,400
when you don't have perfect information

2978
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:37,679
about the situation you tend to fill the

2979
01:34:36,399 --> 01:34:40,799
gaps with the

2980
01:34:37,679 --> 01:34:44,239
the worst possible or at least a bad

2981
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:46,639
uh story that fills those gaps and

2982
01:34:44,238 --> 01:34:49,118
i think it's good to live life

2983
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:51,199
uh maybe not fully naively but filling

2984
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:52,000
in the gaps with the with the with the

2985
01:34:51,198 --> 01:34:53,279
good

2986
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,279
with the

2987
01:34:53,279 --> 01:34:57,198
best with the positive with the with the

2988
01:34:55,279 --> 01:34:59,599
hopeful explanation of why you see this

2989
01:34:57,198 --> 01:35:01,839
so if you see somebody like you trying

2990
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:03,920
to make money on a book about numpy

2991
01:35:01,840 --> 01:35:06,480
there's a million stories around that

2992
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:07,760
that are positive and those are good to

2993
01:35:06,479 --> 01:35:10,559
think about

2994
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:11,600
to project positive intent on to people

2995
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:13,440
because

2996
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,440
for many reasons usually because people

2997
01:35:13,439 --> 01:35:17,039
are good and they do have good intent

2998
01:35:15,439 --> 01:35:19,039
and also when you project that positive

2999
01:35:17,039 --> 01:35:21,359
intent people step up to that

3000
01:35:19,039 --> 01:35:23,679
too yes so like it's it has a great

3001
01:35:21,359 --> 01:35:25,279
point it has this kind of viral nature

3002
01:35:23,679 --> 01:35:27,679
to it and of course

3003
01:35:25,279 --> 01:35:29,840
what twitter early on figured out on

3004
01:35:27,679 --> 01:35:32,239
facebook is that they can make a lot of

3005
01:35:29,840 --> 01:35:34,480
money and engagement from the negative

3006
01:35:32,238 --> 01:35:36,000
yes so like there's this we're fighting

3007
01:35:34,479 --> 01:35:37,839
this mechanism i agree it's just

3008
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:39,920
challenging it's like easier it's just

3009
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:41,840
easier to be to be negative and then for

3010
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:43,920
some reason something in our minds

3011
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:46,159
really enjoys sharing that and getting

3012
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:48,000
getting all excited about the negativity

3013
01:35:46,158 --> 01:35:50,000
we do yeah but but the protective

3014
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:51,679
mechanism perhaps that we're we're going

3015
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:53,198
to eat and if we don't exactly for us to

3016
01:35:51,679 --> 01:35:54,960
be effective as a group of people in a

3017
01:35:53,198 --> 01:35:56,799
software engineering project you have to

3018
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:58,399
project positive intent i think i

3019
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,960
totally agree totally agree and i think

3020
01:35:58,399 --> 01:36:02,719
that's very so that that happens in this

3021
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:04,239
in the space but python has done a

3022
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:05,520
reasonable job in the past but here's a

3023
01:36:04,238 --> 01:36:06,879
situation where i think it's it's

3024
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:09,119
starting to get this pressure where it

3025
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:10,560
didn't i was i really didn't i didn't

3026
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:12,000
know enough about what happened i've you

3027
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:12,960
know talked to several people about it

3028
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:14,238
and i know

3029
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:15,439
i think most of the steering committee

3030
01:36:14,238 --> 01:36:17,519
members today

3031
01:36:15,439 --> 01:36:19,118
uh one one person nominated me for that

3032
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,400
role but it's the wrong role for me

3033
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:22,399
right now right

3034
01:36:20,399 --> 01:36:24,319
um i have a lot of respect for the

3035
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:26,399
python developer space and the python

3036
01:36:24,319 --> 01:36:27,840
developers i also understand the gap

3037
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:29,920
between computer science python

3038
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:32,079
developers and array programming

3039
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:34,560
developers or science developers in fact

3040
01:36:32,079 --> 01:36:36,559
python succeeds in the array space the

3041
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:38,239
more it has people in that boundary and

3042
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:39,679
there's often very few like i was

3043
01:36:38,238 --> 01:36:42,079
playing a role in that boundary and you

3044
01:36:39,679 --> 01:36:43,440
know working like everything to try to

3045
01:36:42,079 --> 01:36:45,359
keep up with the

3046
01:36:43,439 --> 01:36:46,399
with the what even what guido was saying

3047
01:36:45,359 --> 01:36:48,319
like

3048
01:36:46,399 --> 01:36:50,719
i'm a c programmer but not a computer

3049
01:36:48,319 --> 01:36:52,479
scientist like i was a engineer and

3050
01:36:50,719 --> 01:36:54,800
physicist and mathematician

3051
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:56,559
and i don't i didn't always understand

3052
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:57,679
what they were talking about and why

3053
01:36:56,560 --> 01:36:59,760
they would have opinions the way they

3054
01:36:57,679 --> 01:37:01,359
did so you have to listen and try to

3055
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,560
understand then you also have to explain

3056
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:04,719
your point of view in a way they can

3057
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:06,639
understand and that takes a lot of work

3058
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:08,158
and that that communication

3059
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:09,359
is always the challenge and it's just

3060
01:37:08,158 --> 01:37:11,279
what we're describing here about the

3061
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:13,039
negativity is just another form of that

3062
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:14,800
like how do we come together and it does

3063
01:37:13,039 --> 01:37:15,679
appear we're wired anyway to at least

3064
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,840
have a

3065
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:19,440
there's a part of us that will enemy you

3066
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,600
know friend enemy and

3067
01:37:19,439 --> 01:37:24,000
and we see yeah it's like why are we

3068
01:37:21,600 --> 01:37:25,280
wiring on the enemy front yeah so so why

3069
01:37:24,000 --> 01:37:27,679
are we pushing that why are we promoting

3070
01:37:25,279 --> 01:37:29,840
that so deeply let's assume friend until

3071
01:37:27,679 --> 01:37:31,359
proven otherwise yes yeah

3072
01:37:29,840 --> 01:37:32,880
so because you have such a fascinating

3073
01:37:31,359 --> 01:37:35,039
mind and all this let me just ask you

3074
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:37,039
these questions so one interesting side

3075
01:37:35,039 --> 01:37:40,158
on the python

3076
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:42,719
history is the move from python 2 to

3077
01:37:40,158 --> 01:37:44,559
python 3. you mentioned move from python

3078
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,960
1 to python 2 but

3079
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,480
the move from python 2 to python 3 is a

3080
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:51,760
little bit interesting because it took a

3081
01:37:48,479 --> 01:37:53,839
very long time it uh it broke

3082
01:37:51,760 --> 01:37:56,239
in a quite a small way backward

3083
01:37:53,840 --> 01:37:57,840
compatibility but even that small way

3084
01:37:56,238 --> 01:38:00,399
seemed to have been very painful for

3085
01:37:57,840 --> 01:38:03,600
people is there lessons

3086
01:38:00,399 --> 01:38:05,439
tons of lessons from uh from how long it

3087
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,600
took and how painful it seemed to be

3088
01:38:05,439 --> 01:38:09,439
yeah tons of lessons well i mentioned

3089
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:11,679
here earlier that

3090
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:15,039
numpy was written in 2005.

3091
01:38:11,679 --> 01:38:16,639
it was in 2005 that i actually went to

3092
01:38:15,039 --> 01:38:18,719
guido to talk about getting numpy into

3093
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:20,239
python 3. like my strategy was to

3094
01:38:18,719 --> 01:38:22,079
oh we're moving to python 3. let's have

3095
01:38:20,238 --> 01:38:23,678
that be and it seems funny in retrospect

3096
01:38:22,079 --> 01:38:26,479
because like wait python 3 that was in

3097
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:27,920
20 2020 right when we finally

3098
01:38:26,479 --> 01:38:30,879
ended support for python 2 or at least

3099
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:32,639
2017. the reason it took a long time a

3100
01:38:30,880 --> 01:38:33,840
lot of time i think it was because

3101
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:38,079
one of the things is there wasn't much

3102
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:40,880
to like about python 3. 3.0 3.1 it

3103
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:43,359
really wasn't until 3.3 like i consider

3104
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:44,880
python 3.3 to be python 3.0

3105
01:38:43,359 --> 01:38:47,039
but it wasn't until python 3.3 that i

3106
01:38:44,880 --> 01:38:49,359
thought there's enough stuff in it

3107
01:38:47,039 --> 01:38:51,039
to make it worth anybody using it

3108
01:38:49,359 --> 01:38:53,359
right and then three four started to be

3109
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:54,880
oh yeah i want that and then three five

3110
01:38:53,359 --> 01:38:56,639
as the matrix multiply operator and now

3111
01:38:54,880 --> 01:38:58,000
it's like okay we gotta use that plus

3112
01:38:56,639 --> 01:38:59,679
the libraries that started leveraging

3113
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,079
the some of the features of python

3114
01:38:59,679 --> 01:39:03,600
exactly yeah so it really the challenge

3115
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:06,479
was it was

3116
01:39:03,600 --> 01:39:08,159
but it also illustrated a truism that

3117
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:09,039
you know it's when you have inertia when

3118
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:10,879
you have a pop when you have a group of

3119
01:39:09,039 --> 01:39:12,319
people using something it's really hard

3120
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:14,560
to move them away from it you can't just

3121
01:39:12,319 --> 01:39:16,000
change the world on them and python 3

3122
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,360
you know made some i think it fixed some

3123
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:18,639
things guido had always hated i don't

3124
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:19,839
think he didn't like the fact print was

3125
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:21,520
a statement he wanted to make it a

3126
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,880
function but in some sense there's a bit

3127
01:39:21,520 --> 01:39:27,199
of gratuitous change to the language and

3128
01:39:24,880 --> 01:39:27,920
you could argue and there's people have

3129
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:28,960
but

3130
01:39:27,920 --> 01:39:30,399
there was

3131
01:39:28,960 --> 01:39:32,560
one of the challenges was there wasn't

3132
01:39:30,399 --> 01:39:33,759
enough features and too many just

3133
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,760
changes

3134
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,520
without features and

3135
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,840
so that empathy for the end user as to

3136
01:39:37,520 --> 01:39:41,760
why they would switch wasn't wasn't

3137
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:44,000
there i think also it illustrated just

3138
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:46,159
the funding realities like python wasn't

3139
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:47,920
funded like it was also a project with a

3140
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:49,439
bunch of volunteer labor

3141
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,520
right it had more people so more

3142
01:39:49,439 --> 01:39:53,039
volunteer labor but it was still it was

3143
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:54,560
fun in the sense that least guido had a

3144
01:39:53,039 --> 01:39:56,079
job and i i've learned some of the

3145
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:57,440
behind the scenes on that now since

3146
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,559
since talking to people who lived

3147
01:39:57,439 --> 01:40:00,079
through it and

3148
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:01,360
uh maybe not on air we can talk about

3149
01:40:00,079 --> 01:40:02,880
something

3150
01:40:01,359 --> 01:40:05,198
but it's interesting to see but guido

3151
01:40:02,880 --> 01:40:07,118
had a job but he but his full-time job

3152
01:40:05,198 --> 01:40:08,719
wasn't just work on python yeah like he

3153
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:10,960
had other things to do

3154
01:40:08,719 --> 01:40:14,000
it's just wild it is wild isn't it as

3155
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:16,079
well how few people are funded yes how

3156
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,600
much impact they have yes

3157
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:19,760
maybe that's a feature not a bug i don't

3158
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,320
know maybe yes exactly at least early on

3159
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:24,400
like it's sort of i know yeah it's like

3160
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:26,238
olympic athletes are often severely

3161
01:40:24,399 --> 01:40:28,559
underfunded but maybe that's what brings

3162
01:40:26,238 --> 01:40:29,599
out the greatness perhaps yes correct no

3163
01:40:28,560 --> 01:40:30,719
exactly

3164
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:32,320
maybe this is

3165
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:34,158
essential part of it because i do think

3166
01:40:32,319 --> 01:40:36,000
about that in terms of i currently have

3167
01:40:34,158 --> 01:40:37,759
an incubator for open source startups

3168
01:40:36,000 --> 01:40:39,840
like what i'm trying to do right now is

3169
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:42,320
create the environment i wish that

3170
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,360
existed when i was leaving academia with

3171
01:40:42,319 --> 01:40:44,880
numpy and trying to figure out what to

3172
01:40:43,359 --> 01:40:46,799
do i'm trying to create those

3173
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:48,880
opportunities and environments so

3174
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:50,560
uh and that's that's what drives me

3175
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:52,880
still is how do i make the world easier

3176
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:54,480
for the open source entrepreneur uh so

3177
01:40:52,880 --> 01:40:55,840
let me stay

3178
01:40:54,479 --> 01:40:59,919
i mean i could probably stand numb by

3179
01:40:55,840 --> 01:41:03,199
for a long time but um this is fun

3180
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:05,520
question so andre kapathy leads the

3181
01:41:03,198 --> 01:41:07,759
tesla autopilot team and uh he's also

3182
01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:10,560
one of the most like legit

3183
01:41:07,760 --> 01:41:13,119
uh programmers uh i know

3184
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:14,960
it's like he builds stuff from scratch a

3185
01:41:13,118 --> 01:41:16,479
lot and that's how he builds intuition

3186
01:41:14,960 --> 01:41:18,158
about how a problem works he just built

3187
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:19,919
it from scratch and i always love that

3188
01:41:18,158 --> 01:41:21,198
and the primary language he uses is

3189
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:23,520
python

3190
01:41:21,198 --> 01:41:26,079
for for the intuition building but he

3191
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:27,119
posted something on

3192
01:41:26,079 --> 01:41:29,439
twitter

3193
01:41:27,118 --> 01:41:31,118
saying that they got a significant

3194
01:41:29,439 --> 01:41:34,079
improvement

3195
01:41:31,118 --> 01:41:35,599
on some aspect of their uh like data

3196
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:38,880
loading i think

3197
01:41:35,600 --> 01:41:39,679
by switching away from np dot square

3198
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,520
root

3199
01:41:39,679 --> 01:41:43,440
so the numpy's implementation of square

3200
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:45,440
root to math that square root and then

3201
01:41:43,439 --> 01:41:48,000
somebody else commented that you can you

3202
01:41:45,439 --> 01:41:50,158
can get even a much greater improvement

3203
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:52,800
by using the vanilla

3204
01:41:50,158 --> 01:41:55,118
python square root which is like power

3205
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,880
0.5 power 0.5

3206
01:41:55,118 --> 01:41:58,479
and it's fascinating to me i just wanted

3207
01:41:56,880 --> 01:42:00,400
to

3208
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:02,879
so that absolutely i mean that was some

3209
01:42:00,399 --> 01:42:05,839
shade throwing at some no no

3210
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:07,279
but also we're talking about it's a good

3211
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,279
way to ask

3212
01:42:07,279 --> 01:42:10,479
the trade-off between usability and

3213
01:42:09,279 --> 01:42:12,880
efficiency

3214
01:42:10,479 --> 01:42:15,759
broadly in numpy but also on these like

3215
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:17,600
specific weird quirks of like a single

3216
01:42:15,760 --> 01:42:19,039
function yep so

3217
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:22,560
on that point

3218
01:42:19,039 --> 01:42:23,600
if you use a numpy math function on a

3219
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,520
scalar

3220
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:28,719
it's going to be slower than using a

3221
01:42:25,520 --> 01:42:31,679
python function on that scalar yeah but

3222
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:33,760
because the the math object in p in

3223
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:35,679
numpy is more complicated right because

3224
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,560
you can also call that math object on an

3225
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:38,480
array

3226
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:40,480
and so effectively it goes through a

3227
01:42:38,479 --> 01:42:42,559
similar machine there aren't enough of

3228
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:44,638
the which you would do in a and you

3229
01:42:42,560 --> 01:42:45,920
could do like checks and

3230
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:48,719
fast paths

3231
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:50,719
so yeah if you're basically doing a list

3232
01:42:48,719 --> 01:42:52,239
if you run over a list in fact for

3233
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:53,600
problems that are less than

3234
01:42:52,238 --> 01:42:55,439
a thousand

3235
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,960
even maybe 10 000 it's probably the if

3236
01:42:55,439 --> 01:42:58,079
you're going more than 10 000 that's

3237
01:42:56,960 --> 01:43:00,239
where you definitely need to be using

3238
01:42:58,079 --> 01:43:02,158
arrays but if you're less than that and

3239
01:43:00,238 --> 01:43:04,079
for reading if you're doing a reading

3240
01:43:02,158 --> 01:43:06,079
process and essentially it's not compute

3241
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:07,840
bound it's i o bound and so you're

3242
01:43:06,079 --> 01:43:09,760
you're really taking lists of thousand

3243
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:11,440
at a time and doing work on it yeah you

3244
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:14,560
could be faster just using python

3245
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:15,919
straight up python see but also

3246
01:43:14,560 --> 01:43:17,520
and then this is the so sorry to

3247
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:18,560
introduce there's the fundamental

3248
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:21,119
questions

3249
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:23,440
when you look at the long arc of history

3250
01:43:21,118 --> 01:43:26,479
it's very possible that np

3251
01:43:23,439 --> 01:43:29,198
square is much faster it could be so

3252
01:43:26,479 --> 01:43:30,879
like in terms of like don't worry about

3253
01:43:29,198 --> 01:43:32,559
it it's the the evils of over

3254
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:36,000
optimization or whatever all the

3255
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:37,440
different quotes are on that it's is uh

3256
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:40,079
sometimes obsessing about this

3257
01:43:37,439 --> 01:43:40,799
particular little uh quark is not it's

3258
01:43:40,079 --> 01:43:42,719
not

3259
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,639
it's efficient like for somebody like uh

3260
01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:46,319
if you're if you're trying to optimize

3261
01:43:44,639 --> 01:43:47,520
your path i mean i agree premature

3262
01:43:46,319 --> 01:43:49,198
optimization

3263
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,840
creates all kinds of challenges right

3264
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:53,519
because now but you may have to do it i

3265
01:43:51,840 --> 01:43:55,440
believe the quote is it's the root of

3266
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:57,440
all it's root of all evil right

3267
01:43:55,439 --> 01:43:58,960
let's give dude i think or take that to

3268
01:43:57,439 --> 01:44:00,638
somebody else

3269
01:43:58,960 --> 01:44:02,719
well doc newt is kind of like mark twain

3270
01:44:00,639 --> 01:44:06,239
people just attribute it don't matter

3271
01:44:02,719 --> 01:44:08,000
and it's fine because brilliant so no i

3272
01:44:06,238 --> 01:44:10,319
was a tech user myself and so i have a

3273
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,520
lot of respect and he did more than that

3274
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:12,880
of course but

3275
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:14,159
uh yeah

3276
01:44:12,880 --> 01:44:16,239
someone i really appreciate in the

3277
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:17,279
computer science space yeah i don't i

3278
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:18,799
think that's appropriate there's a lot

3279
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:20,238
of little things like that where people

3280
01:44:18,800 --> 01:44:22,400
actually if you understood it you go

3281
01:44:20,238 --> 01:44:24,319
yeah of course that's the case yeah like

3282
01:44:22,399 --> 01:44:26,000
and the other part and the other part i

3283
01:44:24,319 --> 01:44:27,840
didn't mention and

3284
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:29,118
number was a thing we wrote early on and

3285
01:44:27,840 --> 01:44:30,159
i was really excited by number because

3286
01:44:29,118 --> 01:44:32,399
it's something we wanted it was a

3287
01:44:30,158 --> 01:44:35,439
compiler for python syntax and i wanted

3288
01:44:32,399 --> 01:44:36,799
it from the beginning of writing numpy

3289
01:44:35,439 --> 01:44:39,678
because

3290
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:42,079
of this function question like

3291
01:44:39,679 --> 01:44:44,158
taking the power of arrays is really

3292
01:44:42,079 --> 01:44:45,118
that you can write functions using all

3293
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:47,039
of it

3294
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:48,880
it has implicit looping right so you

3295
01:44:47,039 --> 01:44:50,719
don't worry about this n-dimensional for

3296
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,239
loop with you know four loops four four

3297
01:44:50,719 --> 01:44:54,000
statements you just say oh big

3298
01:44:52,238 --> 01:44:55,759
four-dimensional array i'm gonna do this

3299
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,800
operation this plus this minus this

3300
01:44:55,760 --> 01:44:57,840
reduction

3301
01:44:56,800 --> 01:44:59,920
and you get this it's called

3302
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,679
vectorization in other areas but you can

3303
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:03,679
basically think at a high level and get

3304
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:05,359
massive amounts of computation done with

3305
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:08,079
the added benefit

3306
01:45:05,359 --> 01:45:09,198
of oh it can be paralyzed easily it can

3307
01:45:08,079 --> 01:45:11,118
be put in parallel you don't have to

3308
01:45:09,198 --> 01:45:13,599
think about that in fact it's worse to

3309
01:45:11,118 --> 01:45:15,519
go decompose your you write the for

3310
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:16,880
loops and then try to infer parallelism

3311
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:19,440
from for loops that's actually harder

3312
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:21,359
problem than to take the array problem

3313
01:45:19,439 --> 01:45:22,960
and just automatically parallelize that

3314
01:45:21,359 --> 01:45:25,519
problem that's what

3315
01:45:22,960 --> 01:45:27,279
and and so functions in numpy are called

3316
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:29,040
universal functions u func so square

3317
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:32,238
root is an example of a u func there are

3318
01:45:29,039 --> 01:45:33,920
others sine cosine add subtract

3319
01:45:32,238 --> 01:45:35,439
in fact one of those first libraries to

3320
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:37,840
scipy was something called special where

3321
01:45:35,439 --> 01:45:39,359
i added bessel functions and like all

3322
01:45:37,840 --> 01:45:41,440
these special functions that come up in

3323
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:43,039
physics and i added them as u func so

3324
01:45:41,439 --> 01:45:44,559
they could work on arrays so i

3325
01:45:43,039 --> 01:45:46,000
understood you function very very well

3326
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:46,960
from day one inside of numeric that was

3327
01:45:46,000 --> 01:45:49,118
one of the things we tried to make

3328
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,480
better in numpy was how do they work can

3329
01:45:49,118 --> 01:45:51,839
they do broadcasting what does

3330
01:45:50,479 --> 01:45:54,638
broadcasting mean

3331
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:57,199
but one of the problems is okay what do

3332
01:45:54,639 --> 01:45:59,118
i do with a python scalar

3333
01:45:57,198 --> 01:46:01,118
so what happens the python scalar gets

3334
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:02,238
broadcast to a zero dimensional array

3335
01:46:01,118 --> 01:46:03,679
and then it goes through the whole same

3336
01:46:02,238 --> 01:46:06,079
machinery as if it were a ten thousand

3337
01:46:03,679 --> 01:46:07,600
dimensional array and then that then

3338
01:46:06,079 --> 01:46:09,679
then it kind of unpacks the element and

3339
01:46:07,600 --> 01:46:11,199
then does the addition

3340
01:46:09,679 --> 01:46:12,560
that's not to mention the function it

3341
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:14,238
calls

3342
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:16,880
in the case of square root is just the c

3343
01:46:14,238 --> 01:46:18,319
lab square root right in some cases like

3344
01:46:16,880 --> 01:46:19,840
python's power there's some

3345
01:46:18,319 --> 01:46:21,519
optimizations they're doing

3346
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,600
for that are that could be faster than

3347
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:25,440
just calling this the c lab square root

3348
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:27,760
in the interpreter or the in the no in

3349
01:46:25,439 --> 01:46:29,519
the c code in the python runtime in the

3350
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:31,119
pythagorean so they're

3351
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:32,239
they really optimize it and they have

3352
01:46:31,118 --> 01:46:33,519
the freedom to do that because they

3353
01:46:32,238 --> 01:46:35,118
don't have to worry about it's just a

3354
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,159
scalar it's just a scalar right they

3355
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:37,839
don't have to worry about the fact that

3356
01:46:36,158 --> 01:46:39,759
oh this could be an object with many you

3357
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:41,360
know many pieces they're not the u funk

3358
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:44,400
machinery is also generic in the sense

3359
01:46:41,359 --> 01:46:46,079
that uh type casting and broadcasting

3360
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:47,439
broadcasting's idea of i'm gonna go i

3361
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:49,198
have a zero dimensional array i have a

3362
01:46:47,439 --> 01:46:50,319
scalar with a four dimensional array and

3363
01:46:49,198 --> 01:46:53,039
i add them

3364
01:46:50,319 --> 01:46:54,479
oh i have to just kind of concourse the

3365
01:46:53,039 --> 01:46:55,760
shape of this guy

3366
01:46:54,479 --> 01:46:57,279
to make it work against the whole

3367
01:46:55,760 --> 01:46:59,520
four-dimensional array so it's the idea

3368
01:46:57,279 --> 01:47:01,118
if i can do a one-dimensional array

3369
01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:02,800
against a two-dimensional array and have

3370
01:47:01,118 --> 01:47:05,039
it make sense well that's what numpy

3371
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:07,600
does is it challenges you to reformulate

3372
01:47:05,039 --> 01:47:09,760
rethink your problem yes as a

3373
01:47:07,600 --> 01:47:10,800
multi-dimensional rate problem versus

3374
01:47:09,760 --> 01:47:12,800
like

3375
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:14,719
move away from scalars completely right

3376
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:16,400
exactly yeah exactly in fact that's

3377
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:18,800
where some of the edge cases boundaries

3378
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:20,479
are is that well the they're still there

3379
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:22,400
and this is where array scalers are

3380
01:47:20,479 --> 01:47:24,238
particular so arrays are particularly

3381
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:26,079
bad in the sense that they were written

3382
01:47:24,238 --> 01:47:28,479
so that you could optimize the math on

3383
01:47:26,079 --> 01:47:31,359
them but that hasn't happened

3384
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:33,039
right and so their default is to use is

3385
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:34,000
to coerce the arrays together to a zero

3386
01:47:33,039 --> 01:47:36,719
dimensional array and then use the

3387
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:38,880
number the numpy machinery that's what

3388
01:47:36,719 --> 01:47:40,560
and you could specialize but it doesn't

3389
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,480
happen all the time so in fact when we

3390
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,600
first wrote number we'd do comparisons

3391
01:47:42,479 --> 01:47:46,879
and say look it's a thousand x speed up

3392
01:47:45,600 --> 01:47:48,880
we're lying a little bit in the sense

3393
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:51,039
that well first do with the

3394
01:47:48,880 --> 01:47:52,560
the 40x slowdown of using array scalers

3395
01:47:51,039 --> 01:47:54,639
inside of a loop because if you used to

3396
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:56,880
use python scalars you'd already be

3397
01:47:54,639 --> 01:47:58,560
10 times faster yeah but then we would

3398
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,079
get 100 times faster over that using

3399
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:01,600
just compilation

3400
01:48:00,079 --> 01:48:03,920
but what we do is compile the loop from

3401
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:05,679
out of the interpreter to machine code

3402
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:08,158
and then that's always been the power of

3403
01:48:05,679 --> 01:48:10,319
python is this extensibility so you can

3404
01:48:08,158 --> 01:48:12,000
people say oh python's so slow well sure

3405
01:48:10,319 --> 01:48:14,079
if you do all your logic in the runtime

3406
01:48:12,000 --> 01:48:16,000
of the python interpreter yeah but the

3407
01:48:14,079 --> 01:48:17,920
power is that you don't have to you

3408
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,840
write all the logic which you do in the

3409
01:48:17,920 --> 01:48:22,000
high level is just high level logic and

3410
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:22,960
the the actual calls you're making could

3411
01:48:22,000 --> 01:48:24,719
be on

3412
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:26,719
gigabyte arrays of data and that's all

3413
01:48:24,719 --> 01:48:29,039
done at compiled speeds

3414
01:48:26,719 --> 01:48:32,239
and the fact that integration is

3415
01:48:29,039 --> 01:48:34,399
one can happen but two is separable

3416
01:48:32,238 --> 01:48:36,319
that's one of the uh their language like

3417
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:37,439
julia says we're gonna be all in one you

3418
01:48:36,319 --> 01:48:39,759
can do all of it together and then

3419
01:48:37,439 --> 01:48:41,678
there's the jury's out is that possible

3420
01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:43,520
i tend to think that you're gonna

3421
01:48:41,679 --> 01:48:45,279
there's separate concerns there you want

3422
01:48:43,520 --> 01:48:47,440
to pre-compile them but generally you

3423
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:49,198
will want to pre-compile your

3424
01:48:47,439 --> 01:48:51,198
some of your loops like scipy is a

3425
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:53,519
compilation step to install sci-fi it

3426
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:54,799
takes about two hours if you have many

3427
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:56,560
machines maybe you can get it down to

3428
01:48:54,800 --> 01:48:58,079
one hour but to compile those libraries

3429
01:48:56,560 --> 01:48:59,679
takes about takes a while you don't want

3430
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:00,800
to do that at runtime

3431
01:48:59,679 --> 01:49:02,158
you don't do that all the time you want

3432
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:03,520
to have this precompiled binary

3433
01:49:02,158 --> 01:49:06,479
available that you're then just linking

3434
01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:08,960
into so there's real questions about

3435
01:49:06,479 --> 01:49:11,039
the whole you know source code

3436
01:49:08,960 --> 01:49:13,039
code is running binary code is more than

3437
01:49:11,039 --> 01:49:14,639
source code it's created object code

3438
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:15,920
it's the linker it's the loader it's the

3439
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:17,840
how does that interpret it inside the

3440
01:49:15,920 --> 01:49:19,359
virtual memory space there's a lot of

3441
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:21,279
details there that actually i didn't

3442
01:49:19,359 --> 01:49:23,679
understand for a long time until i you

3443
01:49:21,279 --> 01:49:24,479
know read books on the topic and it led

3444
01:49:23,679 --> 01:49:26,880
to

3445
01:49:24,479 --> 01:49:29,359
the more you know the better off you are

3446
01:49:26,880 --> 01:49:31,118
and you can do more details but

3447
01:49:29,359 --> 01:49:33,279
sometimes it helps with abstractions too

3448
01:49:31,118 --> 01:49:35,198
well the problem as we mentioned earlier

3449
01:49:33,279 --> 01:49:37,679
with abstractions is you kind of

3450
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:41,359
sometimes assume

3451
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:43,520
that whoever implemented this thing

3452
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:46,639
had your case in mind and found the

3453
01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:48,000
optimal solution yes or like you assume

3454
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:49,920
certain things i mean there's a lot of

3455
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:51,279
correct one of the really powerful

3456
01:49:49,920 --> 01:49:52,639
things to me

3457
01:49:51,279 --> 01:49:54,719
early on

3458
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:57,359
i mean it sounds silly to say but with

3459
01:49:54,719 --> 01:50:00,158
python probably one of the reasons i

3460
01:49:57,359 --> 01:50:01,839
fell in love with it is dictionaries yes

3461
01:50:00,158 --> 01:50:03,839
um so

3462
01:50:01,840 --> 01:50:04,880
obviously probably most languages have

3463
01:50:03,840 --> 01:50:07,039
some

3464
01:50:04,880 --> 01:50:08,880
concepts some mapping concept but it

3465
01:50:07,039 --> 01:50:10,560
felt like it was a first class citizen

3466
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:12,960
and it was just my brain was able to

3467
01:50:10,560 --> 01:50:14,639
think in dictionaries but then there's

3468
01:50:12,960 --> 01:50:16,960
the thing that i guess i still use to

3469
01:50:14,639 --> 01:50:19,840
this day is order dictionaries

3470
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:21,920
because that seems like a more natural

3471
01:50:19,840 --> 01:50:23,599
way to construct dictionaries yeah and

3472
01:50:21,920 --> 01:50:25,039
and from a computer science perspective

3473
01:50:23,599 --> 01:50:27,360
the running time cost is not that

3474
01:50:25,039 --> 01:50:30,399
significant but there's a lot of things

3475
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:31,279
to understand about dictionaries

3476
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:33,839
that

3477
01:50:31,279 --> 01:50:35,759
the abstraction kind of

3478
01:50:33,840 --> 01:50:37,279
doesn't necessarily incentivize you to

3479
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:38,320
understand

3480
01:50:37,279 --> 01:50:39,679
right do you really understand the

3481
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:41,279
notion of a hashmap and how that

3482
01:50:39,679 --> 01:50:43,440
dictionary is implemented but you're

3483
01:50:41,279 --> 01:50:44,960
right dictionaries are a good example of

3484
01:50:43,439 --> 01:50:46,638
an abstraction that's powerful and i

3485
01:50:44,960 --> 01:50:48,079
agree with you one of the love i agree i

3486
01:50:46,639 --> 01:50:49,118
love dictionaries too it took me a while

3487
01:50:48,079 --> 01:50:50,960
to understand that once you do you

3488
01:50:49,118 --> 01:50:53,118
realize oh they're everywhere and python

3489
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:54,399
uses them everywhere too like it's

3490
01:50:53,118 --> 01:50:55,679
actually constructed that one of the

3491
01:50:54,399 --> 01:50:57,598
foundational things is dictionaries and

3492
01:50:55,679 --> 01:50:59,199
it does everything with x-rays yeah so

3493
01:50:57,599 --> 01:51:02,159
it is it's powerful order dictionaries

3494
01:50:59,198 --> 01:51:04,000
came later but it is very very powerful

3495
01:51:02,158 --> 01:51:06,079
it took me a little while coming from

3496
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:07,439
just the array programming entirely to

3497
01:51:06,079 --> 01:51:09,359
understand these other objects like

3498
01:51:07,439 --> 01:51:11,439
dictionaries and lists and

3499
01:51:09,359 --> 01:51:12,479
tuples and binary trees

3500
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:15,039
like i said i wasn't a computer

3501
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:16,959
scientist so i studied a raise first and

3502
01:51:15,039 --> 01:51:18,399
so i was very erase-centric and you

3503
01:51:16,960 --> 01:51:20,399
realize oh these others don't have

3504
01:51:18,399 --> 01:51:24,158
purposes and value actually

3505
01:51:20,399 --> 01:51:26,719
um i agree there's a friendliness about

3506
01:51:24,158 --> 01:51:28,079
like one way to think about a raise

3507
01:51:26,719 --> 01:51:29,439
is um

3508
01:51:28,079 --> 01:51:31,760
arrays are just

3509
01:51:29,439 --> 01:51:34,960
not like full of numbers

3510
01:51:31,760 --> 01:51:37,679
but to make them accessible to humans

3511
01:51:34,960 --> 01:51:41,359
and make them less error-prone to human

3512
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:43,199
users sometimes you want to attach names

3513
01:51:41,359 --> 01:51:45,198
human interpretable names

3514
01:51:43,198 --> 01:51:46,479
that are sticky to those arrays so yeah

3515
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:48,479
that's how you start to think about

3516
01:51:46,479 --> 01:51:50,638
dictionaries yes

3517
01:51:48,479 --> 01:51:52,079
you start to convert numbers into

3518
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:53,840
something that's human interpretable and

3519
01:51:52,079 --> 01:51:56,719
that's actually the tension i've had

3520
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:59,199
correct with numpy because correct i've

3521
01:51:56,719 --> 01:52:00,639
built so much tooling around

3522
01:51:59,198 --> 01:52:03,039
human uh

3523
01:52:00,639 --> 01:52:04,480
human interpretability and also

3524
01:52:03,039 --> 01:52:06,238
protecting me

3525
01:52:04,479 --> 01:52:08,799
from a year later not making the

3526
01:52:06,238 --> 01:52:11,839
mistakes by being i wanted to force

3527
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:12,880
myself to use english versus uh

3528
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:14,239
numbers

3529
01:52:12,880 --> 01:52:16,480
yes so there's a there's a project

3530
01:52:14,238 --> 01:52:18,959
called labeled arrays like very

3531
01:52:16,479 --> 01:52:20,559
early it was recognized that oh we need

3532
01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:22,880
we we're indexing numpy we're just

3533
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:24,719
numbers all the columns and particularly

3534
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:26,079
the dimensions i mean if you have an

3535
01:52:24,719 --> 01:52:28,079
image you don't necessarily need to

3536
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:29,519
label each column or row but if you have

3537
01:52:28,079 --> 01:52:31,198
a lot of images so you have another

3538
01:52:29,520 --> 01:52:33,119
dimension you at least like to label the

3539
01:52:31,198 --> 01:52:34,719
dimension as this is x this is y z or

3540
01:52:33,118 --> 01:52:36,719
this is give us some human meaning or

3541
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:39,039
some domain circle meaning

3542
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:41,840
that was one of the impetuses for pandas

3543
01:52:39,039 --> 01:52:42,880
actually was just oh we do need to label

3544
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,800
these things

3545
01:52:42,880 --> 01:52:47,199
and label label array was an attempt to

3546
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:48,639
add that like a lighter weight version

3547
01:52:47,198 --> 01:52:50,079
of that and there's been like that's an

3548
01:52:48,639 --> 01:52:51,039
example of something i think numpy could

3549
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:52,880
add

3550
01:52:51,039 --> 01:52:54,319
could be added to numpy

3551
01:52:52,880 --> 01:52:55,840
but one of the challenges again how do

3552
01:52:54,319 --> 01:52:58,960
you fund this like like i said one of

3553
01:52:55,840 --> 01:53:00,800
the tragedies i think is that so i i

3554
01:52:58,960 --> 01:53:03,198
never had the chance to i was never paid

3555
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:05,119
to work on empire right so i've always

3556
01:53:03,198 --> 01:53:06,638
just done in my spare time always taken

3557
01:53:05,118 --> 01:53:07,679
from one thing taken from another thing

3558
01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:09,920
to do it

3559
01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:11,520
and at the time i mean today it would be

3560
01:53:09,920 --> 01:53:13,039
the wrong time today like pay me to work

3561
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:14,159
on empire now would not be a good use of

3562
01:53:13,039 --> 01:53:16,639
effort but

3563
01:53:14,158 --> 01:53:18,238
but we are finally at quansite labs i'm

3564
01:53:16,639 --> 01:53:20,480
actually paying people to work on numpy

3565
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:22,638
and scipy which is i'm thrilled with i'm

3566
01:53:20,479 --> 01:53:24,158
excited by uh i've wanted to do that

3567
01:53:22,639 --> 01:53:25,599
it's what i wanted to do from day one it

3568
01:53:24,158 --> 01:53:27,519
just took me a while

3569
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:29,599
to figure out a mechanism to do that

3570
01:53:27,520 --> 01:53:32,400
even like in the university setting

3571
01:53:29,599 --> 01:53:35,039
respecting that from like

3572
01:53:32,399 --> 01:53:37,920
pushing students young minds the younger

3573
01:53:35,039 --> 01:53:40,399
graduate students to contribute

3574
01:53:37,920 --> 01:53:42,239
and then figuring out financial uh

3575
01:53:40,399 --> 01:53:45,118
mechanisms that enable them to

3576
01:53:42,238 --> 01:53:46,479
contribute and then sort of reward them

3577
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:48,238
for their um

3578
01:53:46,479 --> 01:53:50,479
innovative scientific journey that that

3579
01:53:48,238 --> 01:53:52,718
would be nice but then also just the

3580
01:53:50,479 --> 01:53:54,799
better allocation of resources

3581
01:53:52,719 --> 01:53:57,039
well you know it's 20-year anniversary

3582
01:53:54,800 --> 01:53:59,599
since 9 11 and i was just looking we

3583
01:53:57,039 --> 01:54:02,319
spent over six trillion dollars in in

3584
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:05,360
the middle east after 9 11

3585
01:54:02,319 --> 01:54:06,158
in the various efforts there and sort of

3586
01:54:05,359 --> 01:54:08,079
to

3587
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:09,679
put politics and all that aside it's

3588
01:54:08,079 --> 01:54:11,198
just you think about the education

3589
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:14,158
system all the other ways we could have

3590
01:54:11,198 --> 01:54:18,079
possibly allocated that money

3591
01:54:14,158 --> 01:54:18,079
to me yeah to take it back

3592
01:54:18,238 --> 01:54:24,638
the amount of impact you would have by

3593
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:26,880
allocating a little bit of money to uh

3594
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:30,000
the programmers yeah that build the

3595
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:32,079
tools that run the world is fascinating

3596
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:33,520
i mean it is i

3597
01:54:32,079 --> 01:54:36,079
it i don't know

3598
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:37,920
i think uh again there is some aspect to

3599
01:54:36,079 --> 01:54:40,960
uh being broke

3600
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:43,679
as somewhat of a feature not a bug that

3601
01:54:40,960 --> 01:54:46,079
you make sure that you manage that right

3602
01:54:43,679 --> 01:54:48,719
now i know i it's so i but i don't think

3603
01:54:46,079 --> 01:54:50,800
that's a big part so it's like i think

3604
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:52,639
you can you can have enough money and

3605
01:54:50,800 --> 01:54:55,440
actually be wealthy while maintaining

3606
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:56,800
your values agreed i think agreed

3607
01:54:55,439 --> 01:54:58,000
there's an old adage that you know

3608
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,920
nations that trade together don't go to

3609
01:54:58,000 --> 01:55:01,198
war together yeah right i i've often

3610
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,230
thought about you know nations that code

3611
01:55:01,198 --> 01:55:04,000
together

3612
01:55:02,229 --> 01:55:05,678
[Laughter]

3613
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,920
one thing i love about open source is

3614
01:55:05,679 --> 01:55:09,279
it's global it's multinational like

3615
01:55:07,920 --> 01:55:10,399
there aren't national boundaries one of

3616
01:55:09,279 --> 01:55:11,920
the challenges with business and open

3617
01:55:10,399 --> 01:55:13,839
source is the fact that business is

3618
01:55:11,920 --> 01:55:14,800
national like businesses are entities

3619
01:55:13,840 --> 01:55:16,960
that are recognized in legal

3620
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:18,320
jurisdictions right and have laws that

3621
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:21,279
are respected in those jurisdictions and

3622
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:23,118
hiring and yet the open source ecosystem

3623
01:55:21,279 --> 01:55:24,639
is not it's not it's not there like

3624
01:55:23,118 --> 01:55:26,079
currently one of the problems we're

3625
01:55:24,639 --> 01:55:26,880
solving is hiring people all over the

3626
01:55:26,079 --> 01:55:28,158
world

3627
01:55:26,880 --> 01:55:29,920
right because we

3628
01:55:28,158 --> 01:55:31,839
it's a global effort and i've had the

3629
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:35,359
chance to work and i've loved the chance

3630
01:55:31,840 --> 01:55:37,199
i've never been to uh like a iran but i

3631
01:55:35,359 --> 01:55:39,598
once had a conference i was able to talk

3632
01:55:37,198 --> 01:55:41,678
to people there right and talk to folks

3633
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,520
in uh pakistan never been there but we

3634
01:55:41,679 --> 01:55:45,520
had a a

3635
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:48,080
call where there are people there like

3636
01:55:45,520 --> 01:55:49,760
just scientists and normal people and

3637
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:51,118
you know and and it's there's a there's

3638
01:55:49,760 --> 01:55:54,159
a certain amount of

3639
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:56,079
humanizing right that gets away from the

3640
01:55:54,158 --> 01:55:58,399
like we often get the memes of society

3641
01:55:56,079 --> 01:56:00,158
that bubble up and get her get discussed

3642
01:55:58,399 --> 01:56:01,679
but the memes are not even an accurate

3643
01:56:00,158 --> 01:56:02,479
reflection of the reality of what people

3644
01:56:01,679 --> 01:56:04,719
are

3645
01:56:02,479 --> 01:56:06,718
well if you look at the major power

3646
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:09,920
centers that are leading to something

3647
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:12,880
like cyber war in the next few decades

3648
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:15,440
it's united states it's russia and china

3649
01:56:12,880 --> 01:56:18,239
right and th those three countries in

3650
01:56:15,439 --> 01:56:20,399
particular have incredible developers

3651
01:56:18,238 --> 01:56:22,238
so if they work together yeah i think

3652
01:56:20,399 --> 01:56:23,920
that's one way the politicians can do

3653
01:56:22,238 --> 01:56:26,238
their stupid bickering but like the

3654
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:28,399
there's a layer of infrastructure of

3655
01:56:26,238 --> 01:56:30,959
humanity yeah if they collaborate

3656
01:56:28,399 --> 01:56:33,118
together that that i think can prevent

3657
01:56:30,960 --> 01:56:35,198
major uh major

3658
01:56:33,118 --> 01:56:37,759
military conflict which would i think

3659
01:56:35,198 --> 01:56:39,919
most likely happen at the cyber level

3660
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:41,679
versus the actual hot war level you're

3661
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:43,279
right no i think that's good that's good

3662
01:56:41,679 --> 01:56:45,520
prediction

3663
01:56:43,279 --> 01:56:46,639
nations that code together uh

3664
01:56:45,520 --> 01:56:48,480
don't go to war yeah they don't go to

3665
01:56:46,639 --> 01:56:50,239
war together that's that's a hope right

3666
01:56:48,479 --> 01:56:52,238
that's one of the philosophical hopes

3667
01:56:50,238 --> 01:56:54,158
but yeah

3668
01:56:52,238 --> 01:56:55,439
so you mentioned uh the project of

3669
01:56:54,158 --> 01:56:57,679
number

3670
01:56:55,439 --> 01:56:59,759
which is um

3671
01:56:57,679 --> 01:57:02,239
fascinating so from the early days there

3672
01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:04,400
was kind of a push back on python that

3673
01:57:02,238 --> 01:57:06,000
it's not fast

3674
01:57:04,399 --> 01:57:08,158
you know you see c if you want to write

3675
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:10,079
something that's fast you use cc plus if

3676
01:57:08,158 --> 01:57:12,158
you want to write something that's

3677
01:57:10,079 --> 01:57:13,198
usable and friendly but slow you use

3678
01:57:12,158 --> 01:57:14,479
python

3679
01:57:13,198 --> 01:57:16,799
and so

3680
01:57:14,479 --> 01:57:18,638
what is uh number what is its goal how

3681
01:57:16,800 --> 01:57:20,639
does it work great yeah yes that's what

3682
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:21,520
the argument and the reality was people

3683
01:57:20,639 --> 01:57:23,279
would write

3684
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:25,119
high-level code and use compiled code

3685
01:57:23,279 --> 01:57:26,479
but there's still user story use cases

3686
01:57:25,118 --> 01:57:28,399
where you want to

3687
01:57:26,479 --> 01:57:30,559
write python but then have it still be

3688
01:57:28,399 --> 01:57:32,799
fast you still need to write a for loop

3689
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:34,560
like before number it was always don't

3690
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:37,119
write a for loop you know write it in a

3691
01:57:34,560 --> 01:57:39,039
vectorized way you put in an array

3692
01:57:37,118 --> 01:57:40,880
and often that'll that can make a memory

3693
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:42,560
trade off like quite often you can do it

3694
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:44,480
but then you make maybe use more memory

3695
01:57:42,560 --> 01:57:45,760
because you have to build this array of

3696
01:57:44,479 --> 01:57:46,638
data that you don't necessarily need all

3697
01:57:45,760 --> 01:57:47,520
the time

3698
01:57:46,639 --> 01:57:49,520
so

3699
01:57:47,520 --> 01:57:50,320
number was it started from a desire to

3700
01:57:49,520 --> 01:57:52,719
have

3701
01:57:50,319 --> 01:57:55,279
a kind of a vectorized that worked

3702
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:56,960
vectorized was a was a tool in numpy it

3703
01:57:55,279 --> 01:57:58,880
was released you give it a python

3704
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:00,480
function and it gave you a universal

3705
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:02,159
function a u-function would work on

3706
01:58:00,479 --> 01:58:04,638
arrays so get the function that just

3707
01:58:02,158 --> 01:58:06,238
worked on a scalar like you could make a

3708
01:58:04,639 --> 01:58:08,880
like the classic case was a simple

3709
01:58:06,238 --> 01:58:12,000
function and if then statement in it so

3710
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:13,920
uh sine x over x function sync function

3711
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,920
if x equals zero return one otherwise do

3712
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:17,359
sine x over x

3713
01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:18,960
the challenge is you don't want that

3714
01:58:17,359 --> 01:58:20,719
loop had one in python so you want a

3715
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:23,039
compiled version of that

3716
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:24,800
um but the ufo the vectorize and numpy

3717
01:58:23,039 --> 01:58:26,880
would just give you a python function so

3718
01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:29,440
it would take the array of numbers and

3719
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:30,719
at every call do a loop back into python

3720
01:58:29,439 --> 01:58:32,079
so it was very slow it gave me the

3721
01:58:30,719 --> 01:58:34,560
appearance of a u func but it was very

3722
01:58:32,079 --> 01:58:36,158
slow so i always wanted a vectorize that

3723
01:58:34,560 --> 01:58:38,320
would take that python scalar function

3724
01:58:36,158 --> 01:58:41,039
and produce a u-func working on binary

3725
01:58:38,319 --> 01:58:42,960
native code so in fact i had somebody

3726
01:58:41,039 --> 01:58:44,399
work on that with pi pi to see if

3727
01:58:42,960 --> 01:58:48,239
pipette could be used to produce a u

3728
01:58:44,399 --> 01:58:50,719
func like that early on um in 2009 or

3729
01:58:48,238 --> 01:58:52,000
something like that 2010. um they didn't

3730
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:54,319
work that well it was kind of pretty

3731
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:57,039
bulky but in 2012

3732
01:58:54,319 --> 01:58:58,799
uh peter and i just started anaconda we

3733
01:58:57,039 --> 01:59:00,560
had i just i

3734
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,159
i'd learned to raise money

3735
01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,840
that's a different topic but i've

3736
01:59:02,158 --> 01:59:06,879
learned to you know raise money from

3737
01:59:03,840 --> 01:59:09,520
friends family and fools as they say and

3738
01:59:06,880 --> 01:59:09,520
that's a good line

3739
01:59:09,599 --> 01:59:13,840
oh that's a good sign but you know so i

3740
01:59:12,399 --> 01:59:14,879
we're trying to do something we were

3741
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:16,639
trying to change the world peter and i

3742
01:59:14,880 --> 01:59:18,560
are super ambitious we wanted to make

3743
01:59:16,639 --> 01:59:20,079
array computing and we had ideas for

3744
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:21,520
really what's still still the energy

3745
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:24,000
right now how do you do

3746
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:25,679
at scale data science we had a bunch of

3747
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,840
ideas there but one of them

3748
01:59:25,679 --> 01:59:30,399
i just talked to people about llvm and i

3749
01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:32,159
was like there's a way to do this i just

3750
01:59:30,399 --> 01:59:34,079
i went uh i heard about my friend dave

3751
01:59:32,158 --> 01:59:36,079
beasley at a compiler course so i was

3752
01:59:34,079 --> 01:59:38,158
looking at compilers like and i realized

3753
01:59:36,079 --> 01:59:39,279
oh this is what you do and so i wrote a

3754
01:59:38,158 --> 01:59:41,439
version

3755
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:42,399
of number that just basically

3756
01:59:41,439 --> 01:59:45,519
mapped

3757
01:59:42,399 --> 01:59:47,279
python byte code to lvm

3758
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:49,040
nice right so

3759
01:59:47,279 --> 01:59:50,960
and the first version is like this works

3760
01:59:49,039 --> 01:59:52,479
and it produces code that's fast this is

3761
01:59:50,960 --> 01:59:53,920
cool for you know obviously a reduced

3762
01:59:52,479 --> 01:59:55,678
subset of python i didn't support all

3763
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:57,359
the python language there had been

3764
01:59:55,679 --> 01:59:59,359
efforts to speed up python in the past

3765
01:59:57,359 --> 02:00:00,799
but those efforts were i would say not

3766
01:59:59,359 --> 02:00:01,759
from the array computing perspective not

3767
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:03,520
from the perspective of wanting to

3768
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:05,119
produce a vectorized improvement they

3769
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:07,040
were from perspective of speeding up the

3770
02:00:05,118 --> 02:00:09,839
runtime of python which is fundamentally

3771
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:11,679
hard because python allows for some

3772
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:14,239
constructs that aren't you can't speed

3773
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:16,719
up like it's this generic you know what

3774
02:00:14,238 --> 02:00:19,519
is this variable so i from the start did

3775
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:21,039
not try to replicate python's semantics

3776
02:00:19,520 --> 02:00:23,280
entirely i said i'm going to take a

3777
02:00:21,039 --> 02:00:25,599
subset of the python syntax and let

3778
02:00:23,279 --> 02:00:27,519
people write syntax in python but it's

3779
02:00:25,599 --> 02:00:30,079
kind of a new language really so it's

3780
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:33,119
almost like for loops like focusing on

3781
02:00:30,079 --> 02:00:35,198
for loops scalar arithmetic

3782
02:00:33,118 --> 02:00:36,079
you know typed you know really typed

3783
02:00:35,198 --> 02:00:38,079
language

3784
02:00:36,079 --> 02:00:40,399
a type subset

3785
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:42,079
that was the key so but we wanted to

3786
02:00:40,399 --> 02:00:43,519
add inference of types so you didn't

3787
02:00:42,079 --> 02:00:45,679
have to spell all the types out because

3788
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:47,679
when you call a function

3789
02:00:45,679 --> 02:00:48,800
so python is typed it's just dynamically

3790
02:00:47,679 --> 02:00:51,039
typed so you don't tell it what the

3791
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:52,719
types are but when it runs every time an

3792
02:00:51,039 --> 02:00:54,479
object runs there's a type for the

3793
02:00:52,719 --> 02:00:56,239
variables you know what it is

3794
02:00:54,479 --> 02:00:58,559
and so that was the design goals of

3795
02:00:56,238 --> 02:01:00,479
number were to make it possible to write

3796
02:00:58,560 --> 02:01:03,280
functions that could be compiled

3797
02:01:00,479 --> 02:01:05,519
and and have them use for numpy arrays

3798
02:01:03,279 --> 02:01:07,519
like the needed support numpy race and

3799
02:01:05,520 --> 02:01:10,080
so uh how does it work you have a

3800
02:01:07,520 --> 02:01:12,080
comment within python that tells to do

3801
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:14,079
like how do you help out compiler yeah

3802
02:01:12,079 --> 02:01:16,319
so

3803
02:01:14,079 --> 02:01:17,840
there isn't much actually you don't it's

3804
02:01:16,319 --> 02:01:19,519
kind of magical in the sense that just

3805
02:01:17,840 --> 02:01:21,199
looks at the type of the objects and

3806
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:23,679
then does type inference to determine

3807
02:01:21,198 --> 02:01:26,719
any other variables it needs and then it

3808
02:01:23,679 --> 02:01:28,560
was also because we had a use case that

3809
02:01:26,719 --> 02:01:30,079
that could work early like one of the

3810
02:01:28,560 --> 02:01:31,360
challenges of any kind of new new

3811
02:01:30,079 --> 02:01:32,880
development is if you have something

3812
02:01:31,359 --> 02:01:34,880
that to make it work it's going to take

3813
02:01:32,880 --> 02:01:36,719
you a long time it's really hard to get

3814
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:39,199
out of the ground if you have a project

3815
02:01:36,719 --> 02:01:41,279
where there's some incremental story it

3816
02:01:39,198 --> 02:01:43,118
can start working today and solve a

3817
02:01:41,279 --> 02:01:44,880
problem then you can start getting it

3818
02:01:43,118 --> 02:01:46,639
out there getting feedback because

3819
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:49,039
number today you know numbers nine years

3820
02:01:46,639 --> 02:01:51,920
old today right the first

3821
02:01:49,039 --> 02:01:53,279
two three versions were not great right

3822
02:01:51,920 --> 02:01:54,480
but they solved a problem and some

3823
02:01:53,279 --> 02:01:56,639
people could try it we could get some

3824
02:01:54,479 --> 02:01:58,959
feedback on it not great and that it was

3825
02:01:56,639 --> 02:02:00,400
very focused very very fragile very

3826
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:02,079
substantive

3827
02:02:00,399 --> 02:02:04,158
the subset it would actually compile was

3828
02:02:02,079 --> 02:02:06,000
small and so if you wrote python code

3829
02:02:04,158 --> 02:02:08,319
and said to the way it worked did you

3830
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:09,840
write a function and you say at jit use

3831
02:02:08,319 --> 02:02:12,079
decorators so decorators just these

3832
02:02:09,840 --> 02:02:13,840
little constructs let you

3833
02:02:12,079 --> 02:02:14,880
decorate code with an app and then a

3834
02:02:13,840 --> 02:02:16,719
name

3835
02:02:14,880 --> 02:02:18,719
the atgit would take your python

3836
02:02:16,719 --> 02:02:21,760
function and actually just compile it

3837
02:02:18,719 --> 02:02:23,118
and replace the python function with a

3838
02:02:21,760 --> 02:02:24,880
another function that interacts with

3839
02:02:23,118 --> 02:02:26,399
this compiled function got it and it

3840
02:02:24,880 --> 02:02:27,840
would just do that and

3841
02:02:26,399 --> 02:02:29,679
it would you know we went from python

3842
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:31,520
bytecode then we went to ast i mean

3843
02:02:29,679 --> 02:02:33,118
writing compiler is actually i learned a

3844
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:34,719
lot about why computer science is taught

3845
02:02:33,118 --> 02:02:36,479
the way it is because

3846
02:02:34,719 --> 02:02:37,920
compilers can be hard to write there's

3847
02:02:36,479 --> 02:02:39,759
they use tree structures they use all

3848
02:02:37,920 --> 02:02:42,000
the concepts of computer science that

3849
02:02:39,760 --> 02:02:43,679
are needed and it's actually hard to to

3850
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,880
you can it's easy to

3851
02:02:43,679 --> 02:02:47,039
to write a compiler and have it be

3852
02:02:44,880 --> 02:02:48,400
spaghetti code like the passes become

3853
02:02:47,039 --> 02:02:50,158
challenging and we ended up with three

3854
02:02:48,399 --> 02:02:51,439
versions of number right number got

3855
02:02:50,158 --> 02:02:53,439
written three times

3856
02:02:51,439 --> 02:02:54,799
what's uh

3857
02:02:53,439 --> 02:02:57,039
what programming language is number

3858
02:02:54,800 --> 02:02:58,840
written in python

3859
02:02:57,039 --> 02:03:01,599
okay yeah python

3860
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:03,440
so really yeah it's fascinating yeah so

3861
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:05,679
python but then the whole goal of number

3862
02:03:03,439 --> 02:03:08,559
is to translate python byte code

3863
02:03:05,679 --> 02:03:10,000
to llvm and so lvm actually does the

3864
02:03:08,560 --> 02:03:11,679
code generation in fact a lot of times

3865
02:03:10,000 --> 02:03:13,439
they'd say yeah it's super easy to write

3866
02:03:11,679 --> 02:03:16,480
a compiler if you're not writing the

3867
02:03:13,439 --> 02:03:18,559
parser nor the code generator right so

3868
02:03:16,479 --> 02:03:20,319
for people who don't know llvm is the

3869
02:03:18,560 --> 02:03:21,840
compiler itself so you're compatible

3870
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:23,679
yeah it's really badly named low level

3871
02:03:21,840 --> 02:03:25,599
virtual machine which that part of it is

3872
02:03:23,679 --> 02:03:28,079
not used it's really low doesn't mean

3873
02:03:25,599 --> 02:03:30,719
that

3874
02:03:28,079 --> 02:03:31,840
love chris but the name makes you imply

3875
02:03:30,719 --> 02:03:33,599
that the virtual machine is what it's

3876
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:36,079
all about it's actually the ir and the

3877
02:03:33,599 --> 02:03:38,319
library the the code generation that's

3878
02:03:36,079 --> 02:03:39,840
the real beauty of it the fact that what

3879
02:03:38,319 --> 02:03:43,118
i love about llvm was the fact that it

3880
02:03:39,840 --> 02:03:45,920
was a plateau you could collaborate on

3881
02:03:43,118 --> 02:03:47,439
right instead of the internals of gcc or

3882
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:48,960
the internals of the intel compiler like

3883
02:03:47,439 --> 02:03:50,879
how do i extend that

3884
02:03:48,960 --> 02:03:51,599
and it was a place we could collaborate

3885
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,039
and

3886
02:03:51,599 --> 02:03:55,599
we were early i mean people had started

3887
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:57,519
before it's a slow compiler like it's

3888
02:03:55,599 --> 02:03:58,639
not a fast compiler so

3889
02:03:57,520 --> 02:04:00,400
for

3890
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:03,279
some kind of jits like jits are common

3891
02:04:00,399 --> 02:04:05,839
in language because one uh every browser

3892
02:04:03,279 --> 02:04:07,759
has a javascript jet it does real-time

3893
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:08,960
compilation of the javascript to machine

3894
02:04:07,760 --> 02:04:10,639
code

3895
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:12,078
for people who don't know jet is just in

3896
02:04:10,639 --> 02:04:13,760
time compilation thank you yeah just in

3897
02:04:12,078 --> 02:04:16,319
time compilation they're actually really

3898
02:04:13,760 --> 02:04:17,520
sophisticated in fact i got jealous of

3899
02:04:16,319 --> 02:04:19,519
how much effort was put into the

3900
02:04:17,520 --> 02:04:21,040
javascript jets yes well it's kind of

3901
02:04:19,520 --> 02:04:21,920
incredible what they've done yes that

3902
02:04:21,039 --> 02:04:24,560
was good

3903
02:04:21,920 --> 02:04:26,239
i completely agree i'm very impressed um

3904
02:04:24,560 --> 02:04:28,239
but you know number wasn't it was it was

3905
02:04:26,238 --> 02:04:30,799
an effort to make that happen with

3906
02:04:28,238 --> 02:04:32,879
python and so we used some of the money

3907
02:04:30,800 --> 02:04:34,719
raised for anaconda to do it and then we

3908
02:04:32,880 --> 02:04:36,159
also applied for this darpa grant and

3909
02:04:34,719 --> 02:04:38,560
used some of that money to continue the

3910
02:04:36,158 --> 02:04:40,638
development and then we used proceeds

3911
02:04:38,560 --> 02:04:42,639
from service pro projects we would do we

3912
02:04:40,639 --> 02:04:43,920
get consulting projects on

3913
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:45,679
uh that we would then use some of the

3914
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:47,039
profits to invest in numbers so we ended

3915
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:48,719
up with a team of two or three people

3916
02:04:47,039 --> 02:04:50,800
working on number

3917
02:04:48,719 --> 02:04:52,560
it was a fits and starts right and

3918
02:04:50,800 --> 02:04:54,239
ultimately the fact that we had a

3919
02:04:52,560 --> 02:04:55,920
commercial version of it also we were

3920
02:04:54,238 --> 02:04:57,678
writing so part of the way i was trying

3921
02:04:55,920 --> 02:04:58,800
to fund numbers say well let's do

3922
02:04:57,679 --> 02:04:59,920
the free number and then we'll have a

3923
02:04:58,800 --> 02:05:01,760
commercial version of number called

3924
02:04:59,920 --> 02:05:04,719
number pro and what number pro did is it

3925
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:06,639
targeted gpus so we had the very first

3926
02:05:04,719 --> 02:05:09,599
cuda jit and the very first

3927
02:05:06,639 --> 02:05:13,440
jit compiler that in 2013

3928
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:15,840
for 13 you could run not just a vue funk

3929
02:05:13,439 --> 02:05:17,439
on cpu but a u function gpus and it was

3930
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:19,520
awesome automatically parallelize it and

3931
02:05:17,439 --> 02:05:22,960
get 1000x speed and that's a that's an

3932
02:05:19,520 --> 02:05:25,599
interesting funding mechanism because

3933
02:05:22,960 --> 02:05:27,920
you know large companies

3934
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:30,639
or larger companies care about

3935
02:05:27,920 --> 02:05:33,199
speed exactly in just this way so it's

3936
02:05:30,639 --> 02:05:34,319
it's it's exactly a really good way yeah

3937
02:05:33,198 --> 02:05:35,759
there's been a couple things you know

3938
02:05:34,319 --> 02:05:37,519
people will pay for one they'll pay for

3939
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:39,440
really good user interfaces

3940
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:40,480
right and so and so i'm always looking

3941
02:05:39,439 --> 02:05:41,759
for what are the things people will pay

3942
02:05:40,479 --> 02:05:43,598
for that you can actually adapt to the

3943
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:46,239
open source infrastructure one is

3944
02:05:43,599 --> 02:05:48,560
definitely user interfaces the second is

3945
02:05:46,238 --> 02:05:49,839
speed yeah like a better run time faster

3946
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:51,280
run time and then when you say people

3947
02:05:49,840 --> 02:05:53,039
you mean like a small number of people

3948
02:05:51,279 --> 02:05:55,118
pay a lot of money but then there's also

3949
02:05:53,039 --> 02:05:56,800
this other mechanism that that's true a

3950
02:05:55,118 --> 02:05:58,880
ton of people pay that's true a little

3951
02:05:56,800 --> 02:06:01,920
bit first i gotta

3952
02:05:58,880 --> 02:06:04,159
we mentioned anaconda we mentioned uh

3953
02:06:01,920 --> 02:06:07,118
friends family and fools

3954
02:06:04,158 --> 02:06:08,960
so uh anaconda is yet another so there's

3955
02:06:07,118 --> 02:06:11,920
a company but there's also a project

3956
02:06:08,960 --> 02:06:15,279
correct that is exceptionally impactful

3957
02:06:11,920 --> 02:06:17,440
uh in in terms of uh for many reasons

3958
02:06:15,279 --> 02:06:19,198
but one of which is bringing a lot more

3959
02:06:17,439 --> 02:06:20,238
people into the

3960
02:06:19,198 --> 02:06:22,799
um

3961
02:06:20,238 --> 02:06:25,359
into the community of folks who use

3962
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:26,880
python so what is

3963
02:06:25,359 --> 02:06:29,519
anaconda

3964
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:31,840
what is its goals yeah maybe what is

3965
02:06:29,520 --> 02:06:32,880
conda versus anaconda yeah i'll tell you

3966
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:35,119
a little bit of the history of that

3967
02:06:32,880 --> 02:06:37,840
because anaconda we we wanted to do uh

3968
02:06:35,118 --> 02:06:39,118
we wanted to scale python because we you

3969
02:06:37,840 --> 02:06:40,719
know that was the peter and i had the

3970
02:06:39,118 --> 02:06:42,238
goal of when we started on anaconda we

3971
02:06:40,719 --> 02:06:43,760
actually started as continuum analytics

3972
02:06:42,238 --> 02:06:46,879
was the name of the company that started

3973
02:06:43,760 --> 02:06:49,119
it got renamed to anaconda in 2015.

3974
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:51,440
but we uh we said we want to scale

3975
02:06:49,118 --> 02:06:52,559
analytics numpy's great pandas is

3976
02:06:51,439 --> 02:06:54,559
emerging

3977
02:06:52,560 --> 02:06:55,760
but these need to run at scale with lots

3978
02:06:54,560 --> 02:06:58,560
of machines the other thing we wanted to

3979
02:06:55,760 --> 02:07:00,560
do was make user interfaces that were

3980
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:02,960
web we wanted to make sure the web did

3981
02:07:00,560 --> 02:07:04,639
not pass by the python community that we

3982
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:06,560
had a ways to translate your data

3983
02:07:04,639 --> 02:07:08,078
science to the web so those are the two

3984
02:07:06,560 --> 02:07:09,840
kind of technical areas we thought oh

3985
02:07:08,078 --> 02:07:11,439
we'll build products in this space and

3986
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:12,400
that was the

3987
02:07:11,439 --> 02:07:13,759
idea

3988
02:07:12,399 --> 02:07:15,759
very quickly in but of course the thing

3989
02:07:13,760 --> 02:07:18,159
i knew how to do was to do consulting to

3990
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:20,239
make money and to make sure my family

3991
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:22,238
and friends and fools that it invested

3992
02:07:20,238 --> 02:07:23,359
didn't lose their money so it's a little

3993
02:07:22,238 --> 02:07:24,718
different than if you take money from a

3994
02:07:23,359 --> 02:07:26,559
venture fund if you take money from a

3995
02:07:24,719 --> 02:07:27,760
venture fund the venture fund they want

3996
02:07:26,560 --> 02:07:29,840
you to go big or go home and they're

3997
02:07:27,760 --> 02:07:32,960
kind of like expecting 9 out of 10 to

3998
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:34,560
fail or 99 out of 100 to fail

3999
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:37,039
it's different i was i was out of

4000
02:07:34,560 --> 02:07:38,800
barbell strategy i was like i can't fail

4001
02:07:37,039 --> 02:07:40,560
i mean i may not do super well but i

4002
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:43,440
cannot lose their money so i'm going to

4003
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:46,159
do something i know can return a profit

4004
02:07:43,439 --> 02:07:47,919
but i want to have exposure to an upside

4005
02:07:46,158 --> 02:07:49,598
so that's what happened in anaconda we

4006
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:51,279
didn't there was lots of things we did

4007
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:52,960
not well in terms of that structure and

4008
02:07:51,279 --> 02:07:55,920
i've learned from since and have it

4009
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:58,239
better but we've uh we did a really good

4010
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:59,840
job of kind of attracting the interest

4011
02:07:58,238 --> 02:08:01,519
around the area to get good people

4012
02:07:59,840 --> 02:08:03,360
working and then get funneled some money

4013
02:08:01,520 --> 02:08:04,560
on some interesting projects super

4014
02:08:03,359 --> 02:08:06,639
excited about what came out of our

4015
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:07,599
energy there like a lot did

4016
02:08:06,639 --> 02:08:08,239
so what are some of the interesting

4017
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:12,239
things

4018
02:08:08,238 --> 02:08:14,078
dask number bokeh conda uh there was a

4019
02:08:12,238 --> 02:08:15,279
data shader panel

4020
02:08:14,078 --> 02:08:17,840
holovis

4021
02:08:15,279 --> 02:08:19,920
um these are all tools that are

4022
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:22,480
extremely relevant in terms of helping

4023
02:08:19,920 --> 02:08:24,480
you build applications build tools build

4024
02:08:22,479 --> 02:08:26,638
you know faster code

4025
02:08:24,479 --> 02:08:28,799
um there's a couple of days jupiter lab

4026
02:08:26,639 --> 02:08:30,239
jupiter lab came out of this too

4027
02:08:28,800 --> 02:08:32,719
fascinating yeah

4028
02:08:30,238 --> 02:08:34,559
okay so uh well bokeh does plotting is

4029
02:08:32,719 --> 02:08:35,920
that okay is plotting so bokeh was one

4030
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:37,679
of the foundational things to say i want

4031
02:08:35,920 --> 02:08:39,599
to do plot and python but have the

4032
02:08:37,679 --> 02:08:41,199
things show up in a web right that's

4033
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:43,760
right that's right that's right so

4034
02:08:41,198 --> 02:08:47,198
applauding to me still with all due

4035
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:50,960
respect to matplotlib and bokeh is feels

4036
02:08:47,198 --> 02:08:54,479
like still an unsolved problem not

4037
02:08:50,960 --> 02:08:57,039
it's a big problem right because you're

4038
02:08:54,479 --> 02:08:59,359
i mean i don't know it's a visualization

4039
02:08:57,039 --> 02:09:01,679
broadly yes right i think we've got a

4040
02:08:59,359 --> 02:09:03,439
pretty good api story around certain use

4041
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:04,480
cases of python plotting yeah but

4042
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:06,719
there's a difference between static

4043
02:09:04,479 --> 02:09:08,399
plots versus interactive plots versus

4044
02:09:06,719 --> 02:09:09,840
i'm an end user i just want to write a

4045
02:09:08,399 --> 02:09:11,198
simple

4046
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:12,800
you know pandas started the idea of

4047
02:09:11,198 --> 02:09:14,719
here's a data frame on a dot plot i'm

4048
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:16,239
just going to attach plot as a method to

4049
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:17,920
my object

4050
02:09:16,238 --> 02:09:20,078
which was a little bit controversial

4051
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:20,880
right but works pretty well actually

4052
02:09:20,078 --> 02:09:23,118
because

4053
02:09:20,880 --> 02:09:24,880
there's a lot less you have to pass in

4054
02:09:23,118 --> 02:09:26,238
right you can just say here's my object

4055
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:28,960
you know what you are

4056
02:09:26,238 --> 02:09:29,759
you tell the visualization what to do

4057
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:31,279
so

4058
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:32,719
that and there's things like that that

4059
02:09:31,279 --> 02:09:34,800
have not been you know super well

4060
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:37,118
developed entirely but bokeh was focused

4061
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:38,880
on interactive plotting so you could

4062
02:09:37,118 --> 02:09:40,238
it's a short path between interactive

4063
02:09:38,880 --> 02:09:42,639
plotting and

4064
02:09:40,238 --> 02:09:43,839
application dashboard application and

4065
02:09:42,639 --> 02:09:45,279
there's some incredible work that got

4066
02:09:43,840 --> 02:09:46,880
done there right and it was a hard

4067
02:09:45,279 --> 02:09:49,840
project because then you're basically

4068
02:09:46,880 --> 02:09:51,039
doing javascript and python so we we

4069
02:09:49,840 --> 02:09:52,960
wanted to tackle some of these hard

4070
02:09:51,039 --> 02:09:54,719
problems and try to and just go after

4071
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:56,319
them we got some darpa funding to help

4072
02:09:54,719 --> 02:09:57,679
and it was super helpful it's a funny

4073
02:09:56,319 --> 02:09:59,279
story there we actually did two dark

4074
02:09:57,679 --> 02:10:00,399
proposals but one we were five minutes

4075
02:09:59,279 --> 02:10:02,559
late for

4076
02:10:00,399 --> 02:10:04,799
and darpa has a very strict cutoff

4077
02:10:02,560 --> 02:10:06,159
window and so i we had two proposals one

4078
02:10:04,800 --> 02:10:09,199
for the bokeh and one for actually

4079
02:10:06,158 --> 02:10:10,799
number and the the other work

4080
02:10:09,198 --> 02:10:14,719
which one were you late for

4081
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:16,320
the foundational numerical work so

4082
02:10:14,719 --> 02:10:17,679
fortunately chris let us use some of the

4083
02:10:16,319 --> 02:10:19,118
money to fund still some of the other

4084
02:10:17,679 --> 02:10:20,399
foundational work

4085
02:10:19,118 --> 02:10:22,158
but it wasn't as

4086
02:10:20,399 --> 02:10:23,679
yeah his hands were tired he couldn't do

4087
02:10:22,158 --> 02:10:25,679
anything about it uh

4088
02:10:23,679 --> 02:10:27,679
that was a whole interesting story

4089
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:30,560
so one of the incredible projects that

4090
02:10:27,679 --> 02:10:33,920
you worked on is conda yes so what is

4091
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:35,920
that about yeah conda it was early on

4092
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:37,920
like i said with scipy sci-fi was a

4093
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:39,840
distribution masculine library and he

4094
02:10:37,920 --> 02:10:41,039
said talk to me talking about compiler

4095
02:10:39,840 --> 02:10:42,639
issues and trying to get the stuff

4096
02:10:41,039 --> 02:10:44,479
shipped and the fact that people can use

4097
02:10:42,639 --> 02:10:46,000
your libraries that they have it

4098
02:10:44,479 --> 02:10:48,319
so for a long time we've understood the

4099
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:49,760
packaging problem in python and one of

4100
02:10:48,319 --> 02:10:51,920
the first things you did at that

4101
02:10:49,760 --> 02:10:54,159
consumer analytics became anaconda

4102
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:56,480
was organize the pi data ecosystem in

4103
02:10:54,158 --> 02:10:59,519
conjunction with num focus we actually

4104
02:10:56,479 --> 02:11:01,118
started num focus uh uh with some other

4105
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:03,199
folks in the community the same year we

4106
02:11:01,118 --> 02:11:05,118
started anaconda i said we're going to

4107
02:11:03,198 --> 02:11:07,198
build a corporation but also got to

4108
02:11:05,118 --> 02:11:09,519
reify the community aspect and build a

4109
02:11:07,198 --> 02:11:11,919
nonprofit so we do both of those can we

4110
02:11:09,520 --> 02:11:14,639
pause real quick and and uh can you say

4111
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:16,239
what is pi pi the python package index

4112
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:19,279
like this whole

4113
02:11:16,238 --> 02:11:20,799
story yeah of packaging in python yeah

4114
02:11:19,279 --> 02:11:22,238
that's what i'm going to get to actually

4115
02:11:20,800 --> 02:11:24,159
this is exactly the journey i'm honest

4116
02:11:22,238 --> 02:11:25,359
to sort of explain packaging in python i

4117
02:11:24,158 --> 02:11:26,638
think it's best expressed so the

4118
02:11:25,359 --> 02:11:29,359
conversation i had with guido at a

4119
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:30,719
conference where i said so

4120
02:11:29,359 --> 02:11:32,880
you know yeah packaging is kind of a

4121
02:11:30,719 --> 02:11:35,198
problem megiddo said i don't ever care

4122
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:37,118
about packaging i don't use it i don't

4123
02:11:35,198 --> 02:11:38,238
install new libraries i'm like i guess

4124
02:11:37,118 --> 02:11:39,679
if you're the language creator and if

4125
02:11:38,238 --> 02:11:41,118
you need something just put it put it in

4126
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:42,319
the distribution maybe you don't worry

4127
02:11:41,118 --> 02:11:44,158
about packaging

4128
02:11:42,319 --> 02:11:46,078
but guido has never really cared about

4129
02:11:44,158 --> 02:11:47,279
packaging right and never really cared

4130
02:11:46,078 --> 02:11:48,880
about the problem of distribution

4131
02:11:47,279 --> 02:11:50,238
somebody else's problem and that's a

4132
02:11:48,880 --> 02:11:51,520
fair position to take i think as a

4133
02:11:50,238 --> 02:11:52,638
language creator

4134
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:54,400
in fact there's a

4135
02:11:52,639 --> 02:11:55,760
philosophical question about should you

4136
02:11:54,399 --> 02:11:57,359
have different development packaging

4137
02:11:55,760 --> 02:11:58,800
managers should you have a package

4138
02:11:57,359 --> 02:12:00,559
manager per language is that really the

4139
02:11:58,800 --> 02:12:01,760
right approach i think there are some

4140
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:03,199
answers of

4141
02:12:01,760 --> 02:12:05,360
it is appropriate to have development

4142
02:12:03,198 --> 02:12:06,719
tools and there's an aspect of

4143
02:12:05,359 --> 02:12:08,880
development tool that is related to

4144
02:12:06,719 --> 02:12:09,760
packaging and every language should have

4145
02:12:08,880 --> 02:12:11,520
some

4146
02:12:09,760 --> 02:12:13,280
story there to help their developers

4147
02:12:11,520 --> 02:12:15,199
create so you should have language

4148
02:12:13,279 --> 02:12:16,960
specific language tools development

4149
02:12:15,198 --> 02:12:19,039
tools that relate to package managers

4150
02:12:16,960 --> 02:12:20,639
but then there's a very specific user

4151
02:12:19,039 --> 02:12:22,238
story around package management that

4152
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:24,000
those language specific package managers

4153
02:12:22,238 --> 02:12:26,000
have to interact with and currently

4154
02:12:24,000 --> 02:12:28,238
aren't doing a good job of that that was

4155
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:30,000
one of the challenges that if not seeing

4156
02:12:28,238 --> 02:12:32,479
that difference and it still exists in

4157
02:12:30,000 --> 02:12:34,479
the in the difference today conda always

4158
02:12:32,479 --> 02:12:36,078
was a user

4159
02:12:34,479 --> 02:12:37,359
i'm i'm going to use python to do data

4160
02:12:36,078 --> 02:12:38,158
science i'm going to use python to do

4161
02:12:37,359 --> 02:12:39,598
something

4162
02:12:38,158 --> 02:12:41,679
how do i get this installed it was

4163
02:12:39,599 --> 02:12:43,760
always focused on that so it didn't have

4164
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:45,840
like a develop you know

4165
02:12:43,760 --> 02:12:47,760
classic example is pip has a pip develop

4166
02:12:45,840 --> 02:12:49,039
it's like i want to install this into my

4167
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:50,159
current development environment today

4168
02:12:49,039 --> 02:12:51,599
now

4169
02:12:50,158 --> 02:12:53,279
khan doesn't have that concept because

4170
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:54,560
it's not part of the story for people

4171
02:12:53,279 --> 02:12:55,439
who don't know

4172
02:12:54,560 --> 02:12:57,760
pip

4173
02:12:55,439 --> 02:13:00,399
is a uh python

4174
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:02,960
specific packaging manage package

4175
02:13:00,399 --> 02:13:04,799
manager right that's

4176
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:06,319
that's exceptionally popular that's

4177
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:08,320
probably like the default thing it's the

4178
02:13:06,319 --> 02:13:10,399
default user yeah and so the story there

4179
02:13:08,319 --> 02:13:12,559
emerged because what happened is

4180
02:13:10,399 --> 02:13:14,479
in 2012 we had this meeting at the

4181
02:13:12,560 --> 02:13:15,440
google googleplex and guido was there to

4182
02:13:14,479 --> 02:13:16,319
come talk about what we're going to do

4183
02:13:15,439 --> 02:13:18,078
how we're going to make things work

4184
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:20,399
better and

4185
02:13:18,078 --> 02:13:22,158
wes mckinney me peter peter has a great

4186
02:13:20,399 --> 02:13:23,519
photo of me talking to guido and he

4187
02:13:22,158 --> 02:13:25,118
pretends we're talking about this story

4188
02:13:23,520 --> 02:13:27,119
maybe we were maybe before but we did at

4189
02:13:25,118 --> 02:13:28,158
that meeting talked about it and asked

4190
02:13:27,118 --> 02:13:29,759
you know what

4191
02:13:28,158 --> 02:13:31,359
we need to fix packaging in python like

4192
02:13:29,760 --> 02:13:32,639
people can't get the stuff and he said

4193
02:13:31,359 --> 02:13:34,799
go fix it yourself i don't think we're

4194
02:13:32,639 --> 02:13:36,800
gonna do it

4195
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:38,560
all right the origin story right there

4196
02:13:36,800 --> 02:13:40,239
all right you said okay you said to do

4197
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:42,480
this ourselves so

4198
02:13:40,238 --> 02:13:44,479
at the same time people did start to

4199
02:13:42,479 --> 02:13:47,279
work on the packaging story in python

4200
02:13:44,479 --> 02:13:48,638
it just took a little longer so in 2012

4201
02:13:47,279 --> 02:13:50,078
kind of motivated by our training

4202
02:13:48,639 --> 02:13:51,279
courses we were teaching like how to

4203
02:13:50,078 --> 02:13:52,799
very similar to what you just mentioned

4204
02:13:51,279 --> 02:13:54,719
about your mother like it was motivated

4205
02:13:52,800 --> 02:13:56,239
by the same purpose like how do we get

4206
02:13:54,719 --> 02:13:58,399
this into people's hands and it's this

4207
02:13:56,238 --> 02:13:59,678
big long process it takes too expensive

4208
02:13:58,399 --> 02:14:01,839
it was actually hurting numpy

4209
02:13:59,679 --> 02:14:03,039
development because i would hear people

4210
02:14:01,840 --> 02:14:04,239
were saying don't make that change to

4211
02:14:03,039 --> 02:14:05,760
numpy because i just spent a week

4212
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:06,718
getting my python environment and if you

4213
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:08,239
change

4214
02:14:06,719 --> 02:14:10,319
if you change numpy i have to reinstall

4215
02:14:08,238 --> 02:14:12,399
everything and reinstalling such a pain

4216
02:14:10,319 --> 02:14:14,559
don't do it i'm like wait okay so now

4217
02:14:12,399 --> 02:14:15,920
we're not making changes to a library

4218
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:17,840
because of the installation problem that

4219
02:14:15,920 --> 02:14:18,880
it'll cause for end users okay there's a

4220
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:20,960
problem with pac there's a problem with

4221
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:22,319
installation we've got to fix this so we

4222
02:14:20,960 --> 02:14:23,920
we we said we're going to make a

4223
02:14:22,319 --> 02:14:25,118
distribution of python and we'd

4224
02:14:23,920 --> 02:14:26,719
previously done that previously done

4225
02:14:25,118 --> 02:14:27,759
that at m thought

4226
02:14:26,719 --> 02:14:29,679
i wanted to make one that would give

4227
02:14:27,760 --> 02:14:31,280
away for free everyone could just get

4228
02:14:29,679 --> 02:14:33,679
like that was critical that we just get

4229
02:14:31,279 --> 02:14:35,198
it you know it wasn't tied to a product

4230
02:14:33,679 --> 02:14:36,719
it was just you could get it

4231
02:14:35,198 --> 02:14:39,279
and then we had constantly thought about

4232
02:14:36,719 --> 02:14:40,560
well do we just leverage rpm do we but

4233
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:42,078
the challenge had always been we want a

4234
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:44,400
package manager that works on windows

4235
02:14:42,078 --> 02:14:46,880
mac os 10 and linux the same

4236
02:14:44,399 --> 02:14:48,479
right and it wasn't there like you don't

4237
02:14:46,880 --> 02:14:52,239
have anything like that you have and for

4238
02:14:48,479 --> 02:14:54,479
people who don't know rpm is red

4239
02:14:52,238 --> 02:14:56,399
operating system specific packaging

4240
02:14:54,479 --> 02:14:59,519
correct it's an operating specific yes

4241
02:14:56,399 --> 02:15:01,359
so do you create the the design uh

4242
02:14:59,520 --> 02:15:03,520
questions do you create an umbrella

4243
02:15:01,359 --> 02:15:05,839
package manager then yes cross operating

4244
02:15:03,520 --> 02:15:08,480
system yes that was the decision and a

4245
02:15:05,840 --> 02:15:10,319
neighboring design question is do you

4246
02:15:08,479 --> 02:15:12,238
also create a package manager that spans

4247
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:14,319
multiple programming languages correct

4248
02:15:12,238 --> 02:15:16,158
exactly that was the world we faced and

4249
02:15:14,319 --> 02:15:18,078
we decided to go multiple operating

4250
02:15:16,158 --> 02:15:20,399
systems multiple and programming

4251
02:15:18,078 --> 02:15:22,799
language independent because even python

4252
02:15:20,399 --> 02:15:25,598
in particular was important was scipy

4253
02:15:22,800 --> 02:15:27,440
has a bunch of 4chan in it right and

4254
02:15:25,599 --> 02:15:29,920
scikit-learn has links to a bunch of c

4255
02:15:27,439 --> 02:15:31,759
plus there's a lot of compiled code and

4256
02:15:29,920 --> 02:15:34,960
the python package managers especially

4257
02:15:31,760 --> 02:15:36,719
early on didn't even support that so in

4258
02:15:34,960 --> 02:15:38,800
2000 so we

4259
02:15:36,719 --> 02:15:40,319
we we released anaconda which was just a

4260
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:42,320
distribution of libraries but we started

4261
02:15:40,319 --> 02:15:43,679
work on condo in 2012.

4262
02:15:42,319 --> 02:15:46,960
first version of kana came out in early

4263
02:15:43,679 --> 02:15:48,399
2013 2000 summer of 2013 and it was a

4264
02:15:46,960 --> 02:15:49,679
package manager so you could say con

4265
02:15:48,399 --> 02:15:50,960
install psychic scikit-learn in fact

4266
02:15:49,679 --> 02:15:52,960
that was the

4267
02:15:50,960 --> 02:15:55,039
scikit-learn was a fantastic project

4268
02:15:52,960 --> 02:15:57,359
that emerged kind of it was the the

4269
02:15:55,039 --> 02:15:59,039
classic example of the scikits i still

4270
02:15:57,359 --> 02:16:01,439
talked to earlier about scipy being too

4271
02:15:59,039 --> 02:16:03,039
big to be a single library well what the

4272
02:16:01,439 --> 02:16:04,879
community had done is said let's make

4273
02:16:03,039 --> 02:16:06,078
side kits and there's psychic image

4274
02:16:04,880 --> 02:16:07,440
there's psychic learn there's a lot of

4275
02:16:06,078 --> 02:16:09,359
sidekicks

4276
02:16:07,439 --> 02:16:11,279
and it was a fantastic move you know the

4277
02:16:09,359 --> 02:16:12,559
community did i didn't do it

4278
02:16:11,279 --> 02:16:13,920
i was like okay that's a good idea i

4279
02:16:12,560 --> 02:16:16,400
didn't like the name i didn't like the

4280
02:16:13,920 --> 02:16:17,920
fact you typed scikit image i was like

4281
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:19,598
that's going to be simpler sk learn we

4282
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:20,960
got to make this smaller

4283
02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:22,880
i don't like typing all this stuff from

4284
02:16:20,960 --> 02:16:24,880
imports so i was kind of a pressure that

4285
02:16:22,880 --> 02:16:26,078
way but i love the energy i love the

4286
02:16:24,880 --> 02:16:27,599
fact that they went out and they did it

4287
02:16:26,078 --> 02:16:29,759
and dost people jared millman and then

4288
02:16:27,599 --> 02:16:32,478
of course guyell and and there's people

4289
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:34,478
i'm not even naming that psychic learn

4290
02:16:32,478 --> 02:16:35,840
really emerged this fantastic project

4291
02:16:34,478 --> 02:16:37,279
and the documentation around that is

4292
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:38,960
also incredible this was incredible

4293
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:40,719
exactly i don't know who did that but

4294
02:16:38,959 --> 02:16:42,959
they did a great job a lot of people in

4295
02:16:40,718 --> 02:16:45,358
inria a lot of people a lot of european

4296
02:16:42,959 --> 02:16:47,598
contributors um andreas there's some

4297
02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:49,120
andreas uh in the u.s there's a lot of

4298
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:51,040
just people i just adore i think are

4299
02:16:49,120 --> 02:16:52,800
amazing people um

4300
02:16:51,040 --> 02:16:54,080
awesome use of sci-fi right i love the

4301
02:16:52,799 --> 02:16:55,358
fact that they were using sci-fi

4302
02:16:54,079 --> 02:16:56,558
effectively do something i love which is

4303
02:16:55,359 --> 02:16:58,960
machine learning

4304
02:16:56,558 --> 02:17:00,718
um but i couldn't install it because

4305
02:16:58,959 --> 02:17:03,358
there's so many pieces involved so many

4306
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:05,039
dependencies right yes so our our use

4307
02:17:03,359 --> 02:17:06,000
case of condo was con install cycle

4308
02:17:05,040 --> 02:17:08,319
learn

4309
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:10,679
right and it was the best way to install

4310
02:17:08,318 --> 02:17:14,079
second learn in

4311
02:17:10,679 --> 02:17:15,359
2013 to really 2018

4312
02:17:14,079 --> 02:17:17,439
17 18.

4313
02:17:15,359 --> 02:17:18,800
pip finally caught up i still don't i

4314
02:17:17,439 --> 02:17:20,159
still think it's you should khan install

4315
02:17:18,799 --> 02:17:21,518
second learn for the pip install second

4316
02:17:20,159 --> 02:17:23,679
learn but you can dip install second

4317
02:17:21,519 --> 02:17:25,760
learn the the issue is the package they

4318
02:17:23,679 --> 02:17:27,359
created was wheels and pip does not

4319
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:28,880
handle the multi-vendor approach they

4320
02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:30,719
don't handle the fact you have c plus

4321
02:17:28,879 --> 02:17:32,478
libraries you're depending on they just

4322
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:34,318
stop at the python boundary and so what

4323
02:17:32,478 --> 02:17:35,279
you have to do in the real world is you

4324
02:17:34,318 --> 02:17:37,760
have to

4325
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:39,439
vendor you have to take all the binary

4326
02:17:37,760 --> 02:17:41,200
and vendor it now if your change happens

4327
02:17:39,439 --> 02:17:43,679
underlying dependency

4328
02:17:41,200 --> 02:17:45,599
you have to redo the whole wheel so

4329
02:17:43,679 --> 02:17:47,359
tensorflow is a good example but you

4330
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:50,000
should not pip install tensorflow it's a

4331
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:51,840
terrible idea people do it because

4332
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:52,879
the popularity of pip many people think

4333
02:17:51,840 --> 02:17:55,040
of course that's how i install

4334
02:17:52,879 --> 02:17:56,398
everything python yeah this is one of

4335
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:58,719
the big challenges

4336
02:17:56,398 --> 02:18:01,119
you know you take a github repository or

4337
02:17:58,718 --> 02:18:03,759
just a basic blog post the number of

4338
02:18:01,120 --> 02:18:06,559
times pip is mentioned over conda is

4339
02:18:03,760 --> 02:18:07,920
like 100x to one correct correct so they

4340
02:18:06,558 --> 02:18:09,599
just haven't that was increasing it

4341
02:18:07,920 --> 02:18:11,920
wasn't true early because pip didn't

4342
02:18:09,599 --> 02:18:13,200
exist like conda came first so but

4343
02:18:11,920 --> 02:18:15,920
that's like the long tail of the

4344
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:18,719
internet documentation user generated so

4345
02:18:15,920 --> 02:18:20,398
that like you think how do i install

4346
02:18:18,718 --> 02:18:21,919
google how do i install tensorflow

4347
02:18:20,398 --> 02:18:24,558
you're just not going to see conda in

4348
02:18:21,920 --> 02:18:27,000
that first page not correct exactly and

4349
02:18:24,558 --> 02:18:28,558
that today you would you would have in

4350
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:32,000
2016

4351
02:18:28,558 --> 02:18:34,159
2017 and it's sad because you saw the

4352
02:18:32,000 --> 02:18:35,760
condos solves a lot of usability issues

4353
02:18:34,159 --> 02:18:37,519
correct like for especially super

4354
02:18:35,760 --> 02:18:39,679
challenging thing i don't know one of

4355
02:18:37,519 --> 02:18:42,639
the big pain points for me was uh just

4356
02:18:39,679 --> 02:18:44,239
on the computer vision side uh opencv

4357
02:18:42,638 --> 02:18:46,478
yeah installation that perfect example

4358
02:18:44,239 --> 02:18:48,398
yes i think is i don't know if

4359
02:18:46,478 --> 02:18:50,718
condos solved that pun has an open cv

4360
02:18:48,398 --> 02:18:53,358
package i don't know i i certainly know

4361
02:18:50,718 --> 02:18:55,039
pip has not solved

4362
02:18:53,359 --> 02:18:57,679
i mean there's complexities there

4363
02:18:55,040 --> 02:18:58,880
because right i actually don't know i

4364
02:18:57,679 --> 02:18:59,760
should probably know a good answer for

4365
02:18:58,879 --> 02:19:02,558
this but

4366
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:05,280
you know if if you compile

4367
02:19:02,558 --> 02:19:07,518
opencv with certain dependencies

4368
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:09,599
you'll be able to do certain things so

4369
02:19:07,519 --> 02:19:11,920
there's this kind of flexibility of what

4370
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:14,639
you like what br what options you

4371
02:19:11,920 --> 02:19:17,679
compile with yes and i don't think it's

4372
02:19:14,638 --> 02:19:19,759
trivial to do that in with condor or or

4373
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:21,599
so has a notion of variance

4374
02:19:19,760 --> 02:19:23,120
of a package you can actually have

4375
02:19:21,599 --> 02:19:24,318
different compilation versions of a

4376
02:19:23,120 --> 02:19:25,359
package so not just the version's

4377
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:26,718
different but oh this is compiled with

4378
02:19:25,359 --> 02:19:28,239
these optimizations

4379
02:19:26,718 --> 02:19:30,718
so kana does have an answer to those

4380
02:19:28,239 --> 02:19:33,519
flavors that's flavors basically

4381
02:19:30,718 --> 02:19:34,398
as far as i know does not no no pip

4382
02:19:33,519 --> 02:19:37,120
generally

4383
02:19:34,398 --> 02:19:38,558
hasn't thought deeply about the binary

4384
02:19:37,120 --> 02:19:41,040
dependency problem right and that's

4385
02:19:38,558 --> 02:19:44,079
that's why fundamentally it it doesn't

4386
02:19:41,040 --> 02:19:45,599
work for the sci-fi ecosystem it barely

4387
02:19:44,079 --> 02:19:47,599
it you can sort of paper over it and

4388
02:19:45,599 --> 02:19:50,079
duct tape and it kind of works until it

4389
02:19:47,599 --> 02:19:52,478
doesn't it falls apart entirely so it's

4390
02:19:50,079 --> 02:19:53,840
been a mixed bag like

4391
02:19:52,478 --> 02:19:55,039
and i've been having lots of

4392
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:57,040
conversations with people over the years

4393
02:19:55,040 --> 02:19:58,560
because again it's an area where if you

4394
02:19:57,040 --> 02:20:00,000
if you understand some things but not

4395
02:19:58,559 --> 02:20:01,279
all the things but they've done a great

4396
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:02,959
job of

4397
02:20:01,280 --> 02:20:04,560
community appeal this is an area where i

4398
02:20:02,959 --> 02:20:06,879
think anaconda

4399
02:20:04,559 --> 02:20:08,079
uh as a company needed to do some things

4400
02:20:06,879 --> 02:20:10,318
in order to

4401
02:20:08,079 --> 02:20:12,239
make condom more community-centric right

4402
02:20:10,318 --> 02:20:14,879
and this is a i talk about this all the

4403
02:20:12,239 --> 02:20:16,719
time there's there's a balance between

4404
02:20:14,879 --> 02:20:18,398
you have every project starts what i

4405
02:20:16,719 --> 02:20:19,760
call company backed open source even if

4406
02:20:18,398 --> 02:20:23,279
the company is yourself it's just one

4407
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:25,520
person just you know doing business ads

4408
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:28,159
but ultimately for products to succeed

4409
02:20:25,520 --> 02:20:29,359
virally and become massive influencers

4410
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:30,559
they have to create they have to get

4411
02:20:29,359 --> 02:20:32,559
community people on board they have to

4412
02:20:30,559 --> 02:20:34,000
get other people on board so it has to

4413
02:20:32,559 --> 02:20:35,439
become community driven and a big part

4414
02:20:34,000 --> 02:20:38,478
of that is engagement with those people

4415
02:20:35,439 --> 02:20:40,159
empowering people governance around it

4416
02:20:38,478 --> 02:20:42,000
and there was and what happened with

4417
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:44,000
khan in the early days pip emerged and

4418
02:20:42,000 --> 02:20:46,398
we did we did do some good things condo

4419
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:48,079
forge the kind of forage community is

4420
02:20:46,398 --> 02:20:50,079
sort of the community

4421
02:20:48,079 --> 02:20:52,478
recipe creation community mm-hmm the

4422
02:20:50,079 --> 02:20:54,318
condo itself i am still believe and and

4423
02:20:52,478 --> 02:20:58,000
you know peter is ceo of anakin he's my

4424
02:20:54,318 --> 02:20:59,680
co-founder i ran anaconda tell 2017 2018

4425
02:20:58,000 --> 02:21:00,639
is peter still in peter salanakande

4426
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:02,398
right and we're still great friends we

4427
02:21:00,639 --> 02:21:04,159
have great friends we talk all the time

4428
02:21:02,398 --> 02:21:06,079
i love him to death there's a long story

4429
02:21:04,159 --> 02:21:07,920
there about like why and how when we

4430
02:21:06,079 --> 02:21:10,398
could cover in some some other podcast

4431
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:13,520
perhaps yeah sort of a more maybe a more

4432
02:21:10,398 --> 02:21:15,119
business focused one but but um

4433
02:21:13,520 --> 02:21:16,079
this is one area where i think condos

4434
02:21:15,120 --> 02:21:18,000
should be

4435
02:21:16,079 --> 02:21:19,600
more community driven like he he should

4436
02:21:18,000 --> 02:21:22,478
be pushing more to get more community

4437
02:21:19,600 --> 02:21:23,600
contributors to conda and let let let

4438
02:21:22,478 --> 02:21:25,279
the

4439
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:27,200
not like anika shouldn't be fighting

4440
02:21:25,280 --> 02:21:28,960
this battle yeah right it's actually uh

4441
02:21:27,200 --> 02:21:30,560
it's really the developers like you said

4442
02:21:28,959 --> 02:21:31,679
like help the developers yeah and then

4443
02:21:30,559 --> 02:21:33,119
they'll actually move us the right

4444
02:21:31,680 --> 02:21:35,040
direction but that was the problem i

4445
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:37,600
have as many of the cool kids i know

4446
02:21:35,040 --> 02:21:40,240
don't use conda and that to me is

4447
02:21:37,600 --> 02:21:41,840
confusing it is confusing and it's

4448
02:21:40,239 --> 02:21:43,280
really a matter of kind of has some

4449
02:21:41,840 --> 02:21:44,239
challenges first of all kind of still

4450
02:21:43,280 --> 02:21:45,920
needs to be improved there's lots of

4451
02:21:44,239 --> 02:21:47,680
improvements we made and that it's that

4452
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:50,159
aspect of wait who's doing this and the

4453
02:21:47,680 --> 02:21:52,079
fact that then the pipea really stepped

4454
02:21:50,159 --> 02:21:54,159
up like they were not solving the

4455
02:21:52,079 --> 02:21:56,000
problem at all and now they kind of got

4456
02:21:54,159 --> 02:21:58,000
to where they're solving it for the most

4457
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:59,760
part and then effectively you could get

4458
02:21:58,000 --> 02:22:01,760
like conda solved a problem that was

4459
02:21:59,760 --> 02:22:02,880
there and it still does and it's still

4460
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:03,840
you know there's still great things it

4461
02:22:02,879 --> 02:22:06,000
can do

4462
02:22:03,840 --> 02:22:08,000
but um and we still use it all the time

4463
02:22:06,000 --> 02:22:10,398
at quansite and with other clients but

4464
02:22:08,000 --> 02:22:12,000
with uh but you can kind of do similar

4465
02:22:10,398 --> 02:22:13,680
things with pip and docker

4466
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:14,879
right so

4467
02:22:13,680 --> 02:22:16,239
especially with the web development

4468
02:22:14,879 --> 02:22:18,559
community that part of it again is this

4469
02:22:16,239 --> 02:22:20,079
is the there's a lot of different kind

4470
02:22:18,559 --> 02:22:20,959
of developers in the python ecosystem

4471
02:22:20,079 --> 02:22:22,879
and

4472
02:22:20,959 --> 02:22:24,398
there's still a lack of of some clear

4473
02:22:22,879 --> 02:22:25,759
understanding i go to the python

4474
02:22:24,398 --> 02:22:28,239
conference all the time and there's only

4475
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:30,079
a few people in the pipea who get it and

4476
02:22:28,239 --> 02:22:31,760
then others who are just massively

4477
02:22:30,079 --> 02:22:33,439
trumpeting the power of pitt but just do

4478
02:22:31,760 --> 02:22:35,920
not understand the problem yeah so one

4479
02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:38,318
of the obvious things to me from a mom

4480
02:22:35,920 --> 02:22:39,760
from a non-programmer perspective is the

4481
02:22:38,318 --> 02:22:42,000
across

4482
02:22:39,760 --> 02:22:44,318
operating system usability that's much

4483
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:46,959
more natural so yeah they use

4484
02:22:44,318 --> 02:22:49,680
windows and just it seems much easier to

4485
02:22:46,959 --> 02:22:51,519
uh to recommend conda there but then it

4486
02:22:49,680 --> 02:22:53,520
you should also recommend it across the

4487
02:22:51,520 --> 02:22:55,680
board so i'll i'll definitely surf but

4488
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:57,280
what i recommend now is a hybrid i do i

4489
02:22:55,680 --> 02:22:59,920
mean i have no problem is it possible to

4490
02:22:57,280 --> 02:23:01,760
use oh it is it is what i like build the

4491
02:22:59,920 --> 02:23:03,200
environment with pip with conda build an

4492
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:04,478
environment with conda

4493
02:23:03,200 --> 02:23:06,399
and then pip install on top of that

4494
02:23:04,478 --> 02:23:07,599
that's fine be careful about pip

4495
02:23:06,398 --> 02:23:10,079
installing

4496
02:23:07,600 --> 02:23:12,079
opencv or tensorflow or because if

4497
02:23:10,079 --> 02:23:13,760
somebody's allowed that it's going to be

4498
02:23:12,079 --> 02:23:16,079
most surely done in a way that can't be

4499
02:23:13,760 --> 02:23:16,960
updated that easily so install like the

4500
02:23:16,079 --> 02:23:19,520
big

4501
02:23:16,959 --> 02:23:21,919
packages the infrastructure yeah

4502
02:23:19,520 --> 02:23:24,159
and then the weirdos yeah the the like

4503
02:23:21,920 --> 02:23:26,398
the weird like implementation for some

4504
02:23:24,159 --> 02:23:28,398
uh i had a there's a cool

4505
02:23:26,398 --> 02:23:29,199
library i used

4506
02:23:28,398 --> 02:23:31,680
that

4507
02:23:29,200 --> 02:23:33,920
based on your location

4508
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:37,040
and time of day and date tells you the

4509
02:23:33,920 --> 02:23:39,120
exact position of the sun relative

4510
02:23:37,040 --> 02:23:41,280
to the earth and it's just like a simple

4511
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:43,040
library but yeah it's very precise and i

4512
02:23:41,280 --> 02:23:45,520
was like all right but that was

4513
02:23:43,040 --> 02:23:47,439
that was uh in this episode the thing

4514
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:49,359
they did really well is python

4515
02:23:47,439 --> 02:23:51,359
developers who want to get their stuff

4516
02:23:49,359 --> 02:23:54,559
published they you have to have a pip

4517
02:23:51,359 --> 02:23:57,040
recipe yeah right i mean even if it's

4518
02:23:54,559 --> 02:23:58,959
you know the challenge is there's a key

4519
02:23:57,040 --> 02:24:01,520
thing that needs to be added to pip just

4520
02:23:58,959 --> 02:24:03,919
simply add the pip the ability to defer

4521
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:05,200
to a system package manager like because

4522
02:24:03,920 --> 02:24:07,200
it's you know recognize you're not going

4523
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:10,560
to solve all the dependency problem

4524
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:12,960
so let like give up and allow the allow

4525
02:24:10,559 --> 02:24:15,119
system packager to work that way

4526
02:24:12,959 --> 02:24:16,639
anaconda's installed and it has pip it

4527
02:24:15,120 --> 02:24:18,640
would default to conda to install this

4528
02:24:16,639 --> 02:24:20,478
stuff but red hat rpm would default to

4529
02:24:18,639 --> 02:24:22,478
rpm to install but it's all more things

4530
02:24:20,478 --> 02:24:24,159
like that's the that's a key

4531
02:24:22,478 --> 02:24:26,079
not difficult but somewhat where some

4532
02:24:24,159 --> 02:24:27,760
work feature needs to be added that's an

4533
02:24:26,079 --> 02:24:30,159
example of something like i've known we

4534
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:31,520
need to do it i mean it's where i wish i

4535
02:24:30,159 --> 02:24:33,359
had more money i wish i was more

4536
02:24:31,520 --> 02:24:34,720
successful in the in the business side

4537
02:24:33,359 --> 02:24:36,640
trying to get there but i wish my you

4538
02:24:34,719 --> 02:24:38,318
know my family friends in full community

4539
02:24:36,639 --> 02:24:40,639
that i know was larger was larger and

4540
02:24:38,318 --> 02:24:43,119
had more money because i know tons of

4541
02:24:40,639 --> 02:24:44,478
things to do effectively with more

4542
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:45,760
resources

4543
02:24:44,478 --> 02:24:47,599
but

4544
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:48,559
you know i have not yet been successful

4545
02:24:47,600 --> 02:24:50,079
with channel

4546
02:24:48,559 --> 02:24:51,439
tons of it you know some you know i'm

4547
02:24:50,079 --> 02:24:54,639
happy with what we've done

4548
02:24:51,439 --> 02:24:56,239
we we've created again at quansite

4549
02:24:54,639 --> 02:24:57,599
what we created to get anaconda started

4550
02:24:56,239 --> 02:24:59,199
we created analytics and it kind of

4551
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:00,880
started done it again with quansite

4552
02:24:59,200 --> 02:25:03,040
super excited by that by the way it took

4553
02:25:00,879 --> 02:25:05,119
three years to do it what is kwan site

4554
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:06,800
what is its mission yeah we've talked a

4555
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:08,720
few times about different fascinating

4556
02:25:06,799 --> 02:25:11,199
aspects of it but let's like big picture

4557
02:25:08,719 --> 02:25:13,599
what is big picture quan site kwansai is

4558
02:25:11,200 --> 02:25:15,439
uh it's mission is to connect data to an

4559
02:25:13,600 --> 02:25:17,600
open economy so it's basically

4560
02:25:15,439 --> 02:25:19,920
consulting the pi data ecosystem right

4561
02:25:17,600 --> 02:25:21,120
it's a consulting company and what i've

4562
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:24,559
said when i started it was we're trying

4563
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:27,040
to create products people and technology

4564
02:25:24,559 --> 02:25:29,039
so it's divided into two groups and a

4565
02:25:27,040 --> 02:25:30,560
third one as well the two groups are a

4566
02:25:29,040 --> 02:25:32,080
consulting services company that just

4567
02:25:30,559 --> 02:25:33,920
helps people do data science and data

4568
02:25:32,079 --> 02:25:36,000
engineering and data management

4569
02:25:33,920 --> 02:25:38,318
uh better and more efficient full stack

4570
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:39,920
like full stock science full thing will

4571
02:25:38,318 --> 02:25:42,159
help you build a infrastructure if

4572
02:25:39,920 --> 02:25:43,840
you're using jupiter we need we do staff

4573
02:25:42,159 --> 02:25:45,439
augmentation need more programmers help

4574
02:25:43,840 --> 02:25:47,359
use das more effectively help us gpus

4575
02:25:45,439 --> 02:25:49,120
more effectively just basically a lot of

4576
02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:51,680
people need help so we do training as

4577
02:25:49,120 --> 02:25:54,160
well to help people you know both uh

4578
02:25:51,680 --> 02:25:56,559
immediate help and then get get learn

4579
02:25:54,159 --> 02:25:57,840
from somebody uh we've added a bunch of

4580
02:25:56,559 --> 02:25:58,879
stuff too we've kind of separated some

4581
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:00,559
of these other things into another

4582
02:25:58,879 --> 02:26:02,239
company called open teams that we

4583
02:26:00,559 --> 02:26:03,840
currently started one things i loved

4584
02:26:02,239 --> 02:26:05,680
what we did at anaconda was creating a

4585
02:26:03,840 --> 02:26:07,840
community innovation team and so i want

4586
02:26:05,680 --> 02:26:10,000
to replicate that this time we did a lot

4587
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:11,520
of innovation in anaconda i wanted to do

4588
02:26:10,000 --> 02:26:13,600
innovation but also

4589
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:16,479
contribute to the projects that existed

4590
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:18,479
like create a place where maintainers so

4591
02:26:16,478 --> 02:26:20,559
the scipy and numpy and number and all

4592
02:26:18,478 --> 02:26:22,000
these projects we already started can

4593
02:26:20,559 --> 02:26:24,799
pay people to work on them and keep them

4594
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:26,879
going so that's labs quonsite labs is a

4595
02:26:24,799 --> 02:26:27,920
separate organization it's a non-profit

4596
02:26:26,879 --> 02:26:30,000
mission

4597
02:26:27,920 --> 02:26:32,239
the profits of quansite help fund it in

4598
02:26:30,000 --> 02:26:34,559
fact every project that we

4599
02:26:32,239 --> 02:26:36,318
have at quansite a portion of the money

4600
02:26:34,559 --> 02:26:37,760
goes directly to quansite labs to help

4601
02:26:36,318 --> 02:26:39,840
keep it funded so we've gotten several

4602
02:26:37,760 --> 02:26:41,359
mechanisms we keep quansite labs funded

4603
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:42,880
and currently so i'm really excited

4604
02:26:41,359 --> 02:26:44,318
about labs because it's been a mission

4605
02:26:42,879 --> 02:26:46,559
for a long time what kind of projects

4606
02:26:44,318 --> 02:26:48,318
are within labs so labs is working to

4607
02:26:46,559 --> 02:26:50,398
make the software better like make numpy

4608
02:26:48,318 --> 02:26:52,239
better make scipy better make it it's it

4609
02:26:50,398 --> 02:26:53,119
only works on open source

4610
02:26:52,239 --> 02:26:54,559
so

4611
02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:55,920
you know if somebody wants to so you

4612
02:26:54,559 --> 02:26:57,600
know companies do we have a thing called

4613
02:26:55,920 --> 02:26:59,439
the community work order we call it if a

4614
02:26:57,600 --> 02:27:01,120
company says i want to make spider

4615
02:26:59,439 --> 02:27:03,520
better okay cool

4616
02:27:01,120 --> 02:27:05,200
um you can pay for a month of

4617
02:27:03,520 --> 02:27:06,880
a developer of spider

4618
02:27:05,200 --> 02:27:08,960
or developer of numpy or developer of

4619
02:27:06,879 --> 02:27:10,000
scipy you're not you can't tell them

4620
02:27:08,959 --> 02:27:11,358
what you want them to do you can give

4621
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:14,318
them your priorities and things you wish

4622
02:27:11,359 --> 02:27:15,920
you wish existed and they'll work

4623
02:27:14,318 --> 02:27:17,680
on those priorities with the community

4624
02:27:15,920 --> 02:27:18,879
to get what the community wants and what

4625
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:20,960
emerges what the community wants is

4626
02:27:18,879 --> 02:27:22,478
there some aspect on the consulting side

4627
02:27:20,959 --> 02:27:24,398
that is helping

4628
02:27:22,478 --> 02:27:26,478
as we were talking about morphology and

4629
02:27:24,398 --> 02:27:28,318
so on is there specific applications

4630
02:27:26,478 --> 02:27:31,039
that are particularly like

4631
02:27:28,318 --> 02:27:32,799
driving sort of inspiring the need for

4632
02:27:31,040 --> 02:27:34,240
updates to science correct absolutely

4633
02:27:32,799 --> 02:27:36,799
absolutely gpus are absolutely one of

4634
02:27:34,239 --> 02:27:37,520
those and new hardware beyond gpus i

4635
02:27:36,799 --> 02:27:39,199
mean

4636
02:27:37,520 --> 02:27:41,359
tesla's dojo chip i'm hoping we'll have

4637
02:27:39,200 --> 02:27:42,159
a chance to work on that perhaps

4638
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:43,600
um

4639
02:27:42,159 --> 02:27:44,639
things like that are definitely driving

4640
02:27:43,600 --> 02:27:47,120
it the other thing is driving is

4641
02:27:44,639 --> 02:27:49,519
scalable like speed and scale

4642
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:51,280
uh how do i write numpy code or numpy

4643
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:53,520
like code if i want it to run across a

4644
02:27:51,280 --> 02:27:55,200
cluster you know that's das or maybe

4645
02:27:53,520 --> 02:27:58,239
it's ray i mean there's sort of ways to

4646
02:27:55,200 --> 02:28:00,800
do that now or there's moden and there's

4647
02:27:58,239 --> 02:28:03,039
so pandas code numpy code sci-fi code

4648
02:28:00,799 --> 02:28:05,279
second learn code that i want to scale

4649
02:28:03,040 --> 02:28:08,640
so that's one big area have you gotten a

4650
02:28:05,280 --> 02:28:10,399
chance to chat with andre and elon about

4651
02:28:08,639 --> 02:28:12,239
partic because like no i would love to

4652
02:28:10,398 --> 02:28:14,959
by the way i have not but i'd love to i

4653
02:28:12,239 --> 02:28:16,799
just saw their tesla ai days uh video

4654
02:28:14,959 --> 02:28:18,398
yeah super exciting so that's one of the

4655
02:28:16,799 --> 02:28:19,840
you know i love great engineering

4656
02:28:18,398 --> 02:28:21,119
software engineering teams and

4657
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:22,478
engineering teams in general and they're

4658
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:23,840
doing a lot of incredible stuff with

4659
02:28:22,478 --> 02:28:26,639
python they're like they are

4660
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:29,359
revolutionizing so many aspects of the

4661
02:28:26,639 --> 02:28:30,879
machine learning pipeline i agree that's

4662
02:28:29,359 --> 02:28:32,960
operating in the real world and so much

4663
02:28:30,879 --> 02:28:35,358
of that is python like you said the guy

4664
02:28:32,959 --> 02:28:38,559
running you know andre capati running

4665
02:28:35,359 --> 02:28:40,720
autopilot is tweeting about optimization

4666
02:28:38,559 --> 02:28:40,719
of

4667
02:28:42,799 --> 02:28:46,079
in fact we have at quonset we've been

4668
02:28:44,318 --> 02:28:48,159
fortunate enough to work with facebook

4669
02:28:46,079 --> 02:28:50,318
on pytorch directly so we have about 13

4670
02:28:48,159 --> 02:28:53,280
developers at quonsite some of them are

4671
02:28:50,318 --> 02:28:55,199
in labs working directly on pi torch on

4672
02:28:53,280 --> 02:28:56,479
torch right so i basically started

4673
02:28:55,200 --> 02:28:58,880
quantity i went to both tensorflow and

4674
02:28:56,478 --> 02:29:00,719
pi torch and said hey i want to help

4675
02:28:58,879 --> 02:29:02,639
connect what you're doing to the broader

4676
02:29:00,719 --> 02:29:04,079
sci-fi ecosystem because i see what

4677
02:29:02,639 --> 02:29:05,599
you're doing we have this bigger mission

4678
02:29:04,079 --> 02:29:08,559
we want to make sure we don't you know

4679
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:10,559
lose energy here so uh and facebook

4680
02:29:08,559 --> 02:29:12,959
responded really positively and

4681
02:29:10,559 --> 02:29:15,519
i didn't get the same reaction not yet

4682
02:29:12,959 --> 02:29:17,199
not yet i love the folks

4683
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:19,280
so i really love the folks tensorflow

4684
02:29:17,200 --> 02:29:20,319
too they're fantastic i think it's the

4685
02:29:19,280 --> 02:29:21,680
just

4686
02:29:20,318 --> 02:29:22,799
how it integrates with their business i

4687
02:29:21,680 --> 02:29:25,040
mean like i said there's a lot of

4688
02:29:22,799 --> 02:29:26,239
reasons just the timing the integration

4689
02:29:25,040 --> 02:29:27,920
with their business what they're looking

4690
02:29:26,239 --> 02:29:30,398
for they're probably looking for more

4691
02:29:27,920 --> 02:29:31,840
users and i was looking to kind of have

4692
02:29:30,398 --> 02:29:33,760
some development effort and they

4693
02:29:31,840 --> 02:29:36,000
couldn't receive that as easily i think

4694
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:37,520
so i'm hoping i'm really hopeful uh and

4695
02:29:36,000 --> 02:29:39,840
love love the people there

4696
02:29:37,520 --> 02:29:41,600
what's the idea behind open teams so

4697
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:43,359
open teams i'm super excited about open

4698
02:29:41,600 --> 02:29:45,200
teams because it's one of the

4699
02:29:43,359 --> 02:29:47,040
i mentioned my idea for investing

4700
02:29:45,200 --> 02:29:49,200
directly in open source so that's a

4701
02:29:47,040 --> 02:29:51,040
concept called ferro ss but one of the

4702
02:29:49,200 --> 02:29:52,720
things we when we started quansite we

4703
02:29:51,040 --> 02:29:54,160
knew we would do is we developed

4704
02:29:52,719 --> 02:29:56,478
products and ideas and new companies

4705
02:29:54,159 --> 02:29:59,119
might come out at anaconda this was

4706
02:29:56,478 --> 02:30:01,279
clear right anaconda we did so much

4707
02:29:59,120 --> 02:30:02,880
innovation that like five or six

4708
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:04,479
companies could have come out of that

4709
02:30:02,879 --> 02:30:06,239
and we just didn't structure it so they

4710
02:30:04,478 --> 02:30:07,039
could but in fact they have you look at

4711
02:30:06,239 --> 02:30:08,719
das

4712
02:30:07,040 --> 02:30:09,920
there's two companies coming on a desk

4713
02:30:08,719 --> 02:30:11,039
you know bokeh could be a company

4714
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:12,960
there's like lots of companies that

4715
02:30:11,040 --> 02:30:14,720
could exist off the work we did there

4716
02:30:12,959 --> 02:30:16,318
and so i thought oh here's a recipe for

4717
02:30:14,719 --> 02:30:18,559
an incubation

4718
02:30:16,318 --> 02:30:20,639
a concept that we could actually spawn

4719
02:30:18,559 --> 02:30:22,639
new companies and new new innovations

4720
02:30:20,639 --> 02:30:24,719
then the idea has always been

4721
02:30:22,639 --> 02:30:28,000
well money they earn should come back to

4722
02:30:24,719 --> 02:30:29,199
fund the open source project so so labs

4723
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,879
is you know i think there should be a

4724
02:30:29,200 --> 02:30:32,479
lot of things like quansite labs i think

4725
02:30:30,879 --> 02:30:33,679
this concept is one that scales you

4726
02:30:32,478 --> 02:30:34,959
could have a lot of open source research

4727
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:36,880
labs

4728
02:30:34,959 --> 02:30:38,000
along the way so in 2018 when the bigger

4729
02:30:36,879 --> 02:30:39,519
idea came how to make open source

4730
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:41,200
investors i said oh i need to write i

4731
02:30:39,520 --> 02:30:42,960
need to create a venture fund so we

4732
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:44,880
created a venture fund called quonset

4733
02:30:42,959 --> 02:30:46,879
initiate at the same time it's an angel

4734
02:30:44,879 --> 02:30:48,398
fund really it's you know we started to

4735
02:30:46,879 --> 02:30:49,519
learn that process how do we actually do

4736
02:30:48,398 --> 02:30:51,199
this how do we get lp's how do we

4737
02:30:49,520 --> 02:30:52,239
actually go in this direction and build

4738
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:54,000
a fund

4739
02:30:52,239 --> 02:30:55,280
and i'm like every venture fund should

4740
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,719
have an associate open source research

4741
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,920
lab there's just no reason like our

4742
02:30:56,719 --> 02:30:59,679
venture fund

4743
02:30:57,920 --> 02:31:02,000
the carried interest

4744
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:03,280
portion of it goes to the lab it's it

4745
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:05,040
directly will fund the lab that's

4746
02:31:03,280 --> 02:31:06,880
fascinating brother so you use the power

4747
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:09,439
of the organic formation of teams in the

4748
02:31:06,879 --> 02:31:10,879
open source community and then like

4749
02:31:09,439 --> 02:31:13,200
naturally

4750
02:31:10,879 --> 02:31:15,358
that leads to a business that can make

4751
02:31:13,200 --> 02:31:17,120
there are so many yeah correct it always

4752
02:31:15,359 --> 02:31:18,880
maintains and loops back to the opening

4753
02:31:17,120 --> 02:31:20,240
looks back to open source exactly it's a

4754
02:31:18,879 --> 02:31:21,759
natural fit there's something there's

4755
02:31:20,239 --> 02:31:24,559
there's absolutely a repeatable pattern

4756
02:31:21,760 --> 02:31:26,800
there and it's also beneficial because

4757
02:31:24,559 --> 02:31:28,159
oh i have i have natural connections to

4758
02:31:26,799 --> 02:31:29,920
the open source if i have an open source

4759
02:31:28,159 --> 02:31:31,119
research lab like

4760
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:33,280
they'll always they'll be out there

4761
02:31:31,120 --> 02:31:34,640
talking to people and so

4762
02:31:33,280 --> 02:31:36,239
we've we've had a chance to talk to a

4763
02:31:34,639 --> 02:31:37,920
lot of early stage companies and we in

4764
02:31:36,239 --> 02:31:40,478
our fund focus on the early stages so

4765
02:31:37,920 --> 02:31:43,280
kwan site has the services the lab the

4766
02:31:40,478 --> 02:31:44,959
fund right in that process a lot of

4767
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:47,040
stuff started to happen like oh you know

4768
02:31:44,959 --> 02:31:48,799
we started to do recruiting and support

4769
02:31:47,040 --> 02:31:50,800
and training and i was starting to build

4770
02:31:48,799 --> 02:31:52,879
a bigger sales team and marketing team

4771
02:31:50,799 --> 02:31:54,159
and people besides just developers and

4772
02:31:52,879 --> 02:31:55,839
one of the challenges with that is you

4773
02:31:54,159 --> 02:31:57,680
end up with different cultural aspects

4774
02:31:55,840 --> 02:31:58,960
you know developers

4775
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:00,398
you know there's a

4776
02:31:58,959 --> 02:32:01,919
in any company you go to you kind of go

4777
02:32:00,398 --> 02:32:03,519
look is this a business led company a

4778
02:32:01,920 --> 02:32:04,879
developer led company do they kind of

4779
02:32:03,520 --> 02:32:06,399
co-exist how are they what's the

4780
02:32:04,879 --> 02:32:07,438
interface between them there's always a

4781
02:32:06,398 --> 02:32:09,119
bit of attention there like we were

4782
02:32:07,439 --> 02:32:10,720
talking about before you know what is

4783
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:11,760
the tension there with open teams i

4784
02:32:10,719 --> 02:32:13,840
thought wait a minute we can actually

4785
02:32:11,760 --> 02:32:16,239
just create like this concept of

4786
02:32:13,840 --> 02:32:18,318
quantity plus labs it's well worth while

4787
02:32:16,239 --> 02:32:20,000
it's specific to the pi data ecosystem

4788
02:32:18,318 --> 02:32:22,799
the concept is general for all open

4789
02:32:20,000 --> 02:32:24,478
source so open teams emerge as oh we can

4790
02:32:22,799 --> 02:32:25,920
create a business development company

4791
02:32:24,478 --> 02:32:27,599
for

4792
02:32:25,920 --> 02:32:29,600
many many quant sites like thousands of

4793
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:32,479
kwan sites and it can be a marketplace

4794
02:32:29,600 --> 02:32:34,479
to connect essentially be the enterprise

4795
02:32:32,478 --> 02:32:36,559
software company of the future if you

4796
02:32:34,478 --> 02:32:38,159
look at what enterprise software wants

4797
02:32:36,559 --> 02:32:40,079
from the customer side and during this

4798
02:32:38,159 --> 02:32:42,959
journey i've had the chance to work and

4799
02:32:40,079 --> 02:32:45,280
and sell to lots of companies exxon and

4800
02:32:42,959 --> 02:32:46,559
shell and jv morgan bank of america like

4801
02:32:45,280 --> 02:32:47,600
the fortune 100

4802
02:32:46,559 --> 02:32:49,119
and talk to a lot of people in

4803
02:32:47,600 --> 02:32:50,960
procurement and see what are they buying

4804
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:52,079
and why are they buying so you know i

4805
02:32:50,959 --> 02:32:53,279
don't know everything but i've learned a

4806
02:32:52,079 --> 02:32:55,039
lot about oh what are they really

4807
02:32:53,280 --> 02:32:56,239
looking for and they're looking for

4808
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:58,160
solutions

4809
02:32:56,239 --> 02:33:00,959
they're constantly given products from

4810
02:32:58,159 --> 02:33:02,159
the from enterprise software

4811
02:33:00,959 --> 02:33:03,438
here's open source lead enterprise

4812
02:33:02,159 --> 02:33:05,680
software now i buy it and they have to

4813
02:33:03,439 --> 02:33:07,200
stitch it together into a solution

4814
02:33:05,680 --> 02:33:08,720
open source is fantastic for gluing

4815
02:33:07,200 --> 02:33:09,760
those solutions together

4816
02:33:08,719 --> 02:33:11,358
so

4817
02:33:09,760 --> 02:33:12,719
whereas they keep getting new platforms

4818
02:33:11,359 --> 02:33:13,920
they're trying to buy what most open

4819
02:33:12,719 --> 02:33:16,000
source what most

4820
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:18,079
enterprises want is tools that they can

4821
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:19,840
customize that that are as inexpensive

4822
02:33:18,079 --> 02:33:21,120
as they can yeah and so you almost want

4823
02:33:19,840 --> 02:33:23,439
to maintain the connection to the open

4824
02:33:21,120 --> 02:33:25,680
source because that's yes so open teams

4825
02:33:23,439 --> 02:33:27,840
about solving enterprise software

4826
02:33:25,680 --> 02:33:29,840
problems brilliant brilliant idea by the

4827
02:33:27,840 --> 02:33:31,760
way with a connect but we do it honoring

4828
02:33:29,840 --> 02:33:34,159
the topology we don't hire all the

4829
02:33:31,760 --> 02:33:36,079
people we are a network connecting the

4830
02:33:34,159 --> 02:33:37,600
sales energy and the in the procurement

4831
02:33:36,079 --> 02:33:39,359
energy and we we were on the business

4832
02:33:37,600 --> 02:33:41,520
side get the deals closed and then have

4833
02:33:39,359 --> 02:33:44,000
a network of partners like quansite and

4834
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:45,439
others who we hand the deals to right to

4835
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:46,719
actually do the work and then we off we

4836
02:33:45,439 --> 02:33:47,920
then we have to maintain i feel like we

4837
02:33:46,719 --> 02:33:50,559
have to maintain some level of quality

4838
02:33:47,920 --> 02:33:52,318
control so the client can rely on open

4839
02:33:50,559 --> 02:33:54,398
teams to ensure the deliveries it's not

4840
02:33:52,318 --> 02:33:55,519
just here's a lead go figure that out

4841
02:33:54,398 --> 02:33:56,559
but no we're going to make sure you get

4842
02:33:55,520 --> 02:33:59,040
what you need

4843
02:33:56,559 --> 02:34:00,879
right by the way it's such a skill and i

4844
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:02,319
don't know if i have the patience i will

4845
02:34:00,879 --> 02:34:04,000
have the patience to talk to the

4846
02:34:02,318 --> 02:34:05,920
business people

4847
02:34:04,000 --> 02:34:07,600
or more specific i mean there's all

4848
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:09,200
kinds of flavors of business people or

4849
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:11,760
they're like yeah

4850
02:34:09,200 --> 02:34:12,880
marketing people

4851
02:34:11,760 --> 02:34:13,920
there's a challenge i hear what you're

4852
02:34:12,879 --> 02:34:15,599
saying because i've had the same

4853
02:34:13,920 --> 02:34:17,280
challenge yeah and it's true there's

4854
02:34:15,600 --> 02:34:19,200
sometimes you think okay this is wait

4855
02:34:17,280 --> 02:34:20,560
this is way overwrought yeah so you have

4856
02:34:19,200 --> 02:34:22,960
to become an adult you have to because

4857
02:34:20,559 --> 02:34:25,119
the the companies have needs they have

4858
02:34:22,959 --> 02:34:26,879
ways to make money and they and they

4859
02:34:25,120 --> 02:34:28,399
also want to learn and grow and yet it's

4860
02:34:26,879 --> 02:34:30,398
your job to kind of educate them on the

4861
02:34:28,398 --> 02:34:31,680
best way like the value of open source

4862
02:34:30,398 --> 02:34:32,959
for example right and i'm really

4863
02:34:31,680 --> 02:34:35,439
grateful for all my experiences over the

4864
02:34:32,959 --> 02:34:37,358
past 14 years understanding that side of

4865
02:34:35,439 --> 02:34:38,639
it and still learning for sure but not

4866
02:34:37,359 --> 02:34:39,840
just understanding from companies but

4867
02:34:38,639 --> 02:34:41,439
also dealing with marketing

4868
02:34:39,840 --> 02:34:42,799
professionals and sales professionals

4869
02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:43,920
and people that make a career out of

4870
02:34:42,799 --> 02:34:45,519
that understanding what they're thinking

4871
02:34:43,920 --> 02:34:47,359
about and also understanding what let's

4872
02:34:45,520 --> 02:34:49,359
make this better like we can really make

4873
02:34:47,359 --> 02:34:51,840
a place like open teams i see as the

4874
02:34:49,359 --> 02:34:53,520
transmission layer between companies and

4875
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:55,280
open source communities

4876
02:34:53,520 --> 02:34:57,040
producing enterprise software solutions

4877
02:34:55,280 --> 02:34:59,760
like eventually we want to like today

4878
02:34:57,040 --> 02:35:01,600
we're taking on sas and matlab and tools

4879
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:03,120
that we know we can replace for folks

4880
02:35:01,600 --> 02:35:04,399
really anytime you have a software tool

4881
02:35:03,120 --> 02:35:05,359
an organization

4882
02:35:04,398 --> 02:35:07,119
where you have to do a lot of

4883
02:35:05,359 --> 02:35:08,159
customization or make it work for you

4884
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:09,359
because now you're just buying this

4885
02:35:08,159 --> 02:35:11,280
thing off the shelf and it works it's

4886
02:35:09,359 --> 02:35:14,159
like okay you buy the system then you

4887
02:35:11,280 --> 02:35:16,159
customize a lot usually with expensive

4888
02:35:14,159 --> 02:35:17,039
consultants to actually make it work for

4889
02:35:16,159 --> 02:35:18,478
you

4890
02:35:17,040 --> 02:35:20,080
all of those should be replaced by open

4891
02:35:18,478 --> 02:35:21,279
source foundations with the same

4892
02:35:20,079 --> 02:35:23,039
customers

4893
02:35:21,280 --> 02:35:25,439
such important work such important work

4894
02:35:23,040 --> 02:35:27,120
in these giant organizations they're

4895
02:35:25,439 --> 02:35:29,120
doing exactly that taking some

4896
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:31,280
proprietary software and hiring a huge

4897
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:32,880
team of consultants that customize it

4898
02:35:31,280 --> 02:35:35,280
and then that's whole thing gets

4899
02:35:32,879 --> 02:35:37,679
outdated quick correct and so i mean

4900
02:35:35,280 --> 02:35:39,359
that that's brilliant right the one one

4901
02:35:37,680 --> 02:35:41,040
solution to that

4902
02:35:39,359 --> 02:35:44,079
is how it would like kind of what

4903
02:35:41,040 --> 02:35:45,439
tesla's doing a little bit of which is

4904
02:35:44,079 --> 02:35:47,439
basically build up a software

4905
02:35:45,439 --> 02:35:49,280
engineering team yeah like build a team

4906
02:35:47,439 --> 02:35:50,159
from scratch from scratch and companies

4907
02:35:49,280 --> 02:35:51,600
are doing it well that's what they're

4908
02:35:50,159 --> 02:35:53,039
doing right now yeah right exactly

4909
02:35:51,600 --> 02:35:54,640
that's okay and you're creating an

4910
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:55,920
apology for some of that like right you

4911
02:35:54,639 --> 02:35:57,680
just don't have to do it that's not the

4912
02:35:55,920 --> 02:35:59,120
only answer yeah right and so other

4913
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:00,720
companies can access this new more

4914
02:35:59,120 --> 02:36:01,920
flexible we really that's really really

4915
02:36:00,719 --> 02:36:03,199
say open team is the future of

4916
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:05,359
enterprise software

4917
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:07,359
um it's we're still early like this idea

4918
02:36:05,359 --> 02:36:08,399
just percolated over the past year as

4919
02:36:07,359 --> 02:36:10,399
we've kind of grown quan sight and

4920
02:36:08,398 --> 02:36:12,719
realize the extensibility of it uh we

4921
02:36:10,398 --> 02:36:14,478
just finished in our seed round uh the

4922
02:36:12,719 --> 02:36:16,478
work to help you know get more sales

4923
02:36:14,478 --> 02:36:18,318
people and then push the push the

4924
02:36:16,478 --> 02:36:19,679
messaging correctly and there's lots of

4925
02:36:18,318 --> 02:36:21,519
tools we're building to make this easier

4926
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:23,760
like we want to automate the processes

4927
02:36:21,520 --> 02:36:25,680
we feel like a lot of the power is the

4928
02:36:23,760 --> 02:36:27,439
efficiency of the sales process there's

4929
02:36:25,680 --> 02:36:29,280
a lot of wasted energy

4930
02:36:27,439 --> 02:36:31,120
in small teams

4931
02:36:29,280 --> 02:36:32,960
and the sales energy to get into large

4932
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:34,880
companies and make a deal there's a lot

4933
02:36:32,959 --> 02:36:36,478
of money spent on that stuff creating

4934
02:36:34,879 --> 02:36:38,799
the tools and processes

4935
02:36:36,478 --> 02:36:40,559
makes that super seamless so a single

4936
02:36:38,799 --> 02:36:42,000
company can go oh i've got my contract

4937
02:36:40,559 --> 02:36:43,760
with open teams we've got a subscription

4938
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:45,840
they can get they can make that

4939
02:36:43,760 --> 02:36:47,760
procurement seamless and then the fact

4940
02:36:45,840 --> 02:36:49,520
they have access to the entire open

4941
02:36:47,760 --> 02:36:51,600
source ecosystem and we have a you know

4942
02:36:49,520 --> 02:36:53,280
so we have a part of our work that's

4943
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:54,479
embracing open source ecosystems and

4944
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:56,560
making sure we're doing things useful

4945
02:36:54,478 --> 02:36:57,760
for them we're serving them and then

4946
02:36:56,559 --> 02:36:59,519
companies making sure they're getting

4947
02:36:57,760 --> 02:37:01,760
solutions they care about and then

4948
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:03,840
figuring out which which targets we have

4949
02:37:01,760 --> 02:37:05,280
you know yeah we're we're not taking on

4950
02:37:03,840 --> 02:37:07,600
all of open source all of enterprise

4951
02:37:05,280 --> 02:37:09,040
software yet but but we're well this

4952
02:37:07,600 --> 02:37:12,000
feels like the future the idea and the

4953
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:14,319
vision is brilliant uh can ask you uh

4954
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:16,398
why do you think microsoft bought github

4955
02:37:14,318 --> 02:37:17,680
and what do you think is the future

4956
02:37:16,398 --> 02:37:19,599
great point i thought it was a brilliant

4957
02:37:17,680 --> 02:37:21,520
move i think they did because microsoft

4958
02:37:19,600 --> 02:37:22,479
has always had a developer centric

4959
02:37:21,520 --> 02:37:23,760
culture

4960
02:37:22,478 --> 02:37:25,199
like they always have like one things

4961
02:37:23,760 --> 02:37:26,318
microsoft's always done well is

4962
02:37:25,200 --> 02:37:28,479
understand that their power is

4963
02:37:26,318 --> 02:37:30,879
developers right it's been

4964
02:37:28,478 --> 02:37:32,398
balmer didn't necessarily make a make a

4965
02:37:30,879 --> 02:37:33,438
good meme about how he approached that

4966
02:37:32,398 --> 02:37:34,799
but

4967
02:37:33,439 --> 02:37:36,559
they're broadening that i think that's

4968
02:37:34,799 --> 02:37:39,039
why because they recognize github is

4969
02:37:36,559 --> 02:37:40,959
where developers are at right and so but

4970
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:43,520
do they have a vision like open teams

4971
02:37:40,959 --> 02:37:45,759
type of situation right so yeah

4972
02:37:43,520 --> 02:37:48,000
are they just basically throwing money

4973
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:50,398
at developers to show their support i

4974
02:37:48,000 --> 02:37:53,120
think so without uh a topology like you

4975
02:37:50,398 --> 02:37:55,358
put it like a a a way to leverage that

4976
02:37:53,120 --> 02:37:56,960
like to give developers actual money

4977
02:37:55,359 --> 02:37:58,399
right i don't i don't think so i think

4978
02:37:56,959 --> 02:38:00,079
they're still it's an enterprise

4979
02:37:58,398 --> 02:38:01,279
software company and they make a bunch

4980
02:38:00,079 --> 02:38:02,639
of money they make a bunch of games they

4981
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:04,720
have a big they're a big company they

4982
02:38:02,639 --> 02:38:06,639
sell products i think part of it is they

4983
02:38:04,719 --> 02:38:08,318
know there's opportunity to make money

4984
02:38:06,639 --> 02:38:10,639
from github right there's definitely a

4985
02:38:08,318 --> 02:38:12,318
business there you know uh to sell to

4986
02:38:10,639 --> 02:38:14,079
developers or to sell to people using

4987
02:38:12,318 --> 02:38:15,920
development i think there's part of that

4988
02:38:14,079 --> 02:38:18,398
i think part of it is also there's they

4989
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:20,398
had definitely wanted to recognize that

4990
02:38:18,398 --> 02:38:22,239
that that you need to value open source

4991
02:38:20,398 --> 02:38:23,439
to get great developers which is which

4992
02:38:22,239 --> 02:38:25,359
is an important concept that was

4993
02:38:23,439 --> 02:38:26,800
emerging over the past 10 years that you

4994
02:38:25,359 --> 02:38:29,439
know

4995
02:38:26,799 --> 02:38:30,879
pi data we were able to convince jp

4996
02:38:29,439 --> 02:38:32,639
morgan to support pi data because of

4997
02:38:30,879 --> 02:38:33,839
that fact right that was where the money

4998
02:38:32,639 --> 02:38:35,760
for them putting a couple hundred

4999
02:38:33,840 --> 02:38:37,040
thousand into supporting pi data for uh

5000
02:38:35,760 --> 02:38:38,398
several conferences was they want

5001
02:38:37,040 --> 02:38:40,319
developers and they realized that

5002
02:38:38,398 --> 02:38:42,318
developers want to participate in open

5003
02:38:40,318 --> 02:38:43,279
source so enterprise software folks

5004
02:38:42,318 --> 02:38:45,519
don't always understand how their

5005
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:48,000
software gets used having spent a lot of

5006
02:38:45,520 --> 02:38:50,479
time on the floors at jpmorgan at in

5007
02:38:48,000 --> 02:38:52,719
shell at exxon mobil you see oh these

5008
02:38:50,478 --> 02:38:53,920
companies have large development teams

5009
02:38:52,719 --> 02:38:56,000
and and then you're they're kind of

5010
02:38:53,920 --> 02:38:57,680
dealing with the what's being delivered

5011
02:38:56,000 --> 02:38:59,680
to them so i really feel kind of a

5012
02:38:57,680 --> 02:39:00,720
privilege that i had a chance to learn

5013
02:38:59,680 --> 02:39:02,159
some of these people and see what

5014
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:04,079
they're doing and and even work

5015
02:39:02,159 --> 02:39:05,840
alongside them uh you know as a

5016
02:39:04,079 --> 02:39:07,520
consultant uh

5017
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:08,799
using my using open source and trying

5018
02:39:07,520 --> 02:39:10,560
how do we make this work inside of our

5019
02:39:08,799 --> 02:39:13,039
large organization some of it is

5020
02:39:10,559 --> 02:39:14,959
actually for a large organization some

5021
02:39:13,040 --> 02:39:16,720
of it is messaging to the world that you

5022
02:39:14,959 --> 02:39:19,119
care about developers and you're the

5023
02:39:16,719 --> 02:39:22,079
cool yep you're you care like for

5024
02:39:19,120 --> 02:39:24,640
example like if ford because i talked to

5025
02:39:22,079 --> 02:39:26,879
them like car companies right they

5026
02:39:24,639 --> 02:39:28,879
they want to attract you know you want

5027
02:39:26,879 --> 02:39:30,719
to take on tesla and autopilot you want

5028
02:39:28,879 --> 02:39:32,239
to take that right and so

5029
02:39:30,719 --> 02:39:34,239
what do you do there you show that

5030
02:39:32,239 --> 02:39:36,559
you're cool like you sh you try to show

5031
02:39:34,239 --> 02:39:39,039
off that you care about developers and

5032
02:39:36,559 --> 02:39:41,119
they have a lot of trouble doing that

5033
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:43,359
and like one way i think like ford

5034
02:39:41,120 --> 02:39:45,920
should have bought github they just to

5035
02:39:43,359 --> 02:39:47,600
show off better yeah yeah like these old

5036
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:49,840
school companies and it's in a lot of

5037
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:51,120
good point a lot of different industries

5038
02:39:49,840 --> 02:39:52,559
there's probably different ways it's

5039
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:54,479
probably an article

5040
02:39:52,559 --> 02:39:56,639
that you care to developers and the

5041
02:39:54,478 --> 02:39:57,840
developers it's it's it's exactly what

5042
02:39:56,639 --> 02:39:59,279
you like

5043
02:39:57,840 --> 02:40:01,280
for example

5044
02:39:59,280 --> 02:40:04,399
just spitballing here but like ford or

5045
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:06,079
somebody like that could give

5046
02:40:04,398 --> 02:40:08,719
a hundred million dollars to the

5047
02:40:06,079 --> 02:40:11,680
development of numpy and

5048
02:40:08,719 --> 02:40:14,239
uh like like literally look at like the

5049
02:40:11,680 --> 02:40:15,840
top most popular projects in python

5050
02:40:14,239 --> 02:40:17,840
and just say

5051
02:40:15,840 --> 02:40:20,318
we're just gonna give money right like

5052
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:21,840
that's gonna immediately make you cool

5053
02:40:20,318 --> 02:40:23,680
they could actually yeah and in fact

5054
02:40:21,840 --> 02:40:26,398
they set up num focus to make it easy

5055
02:40:23,680 --> 02:40:28,318
yeah but the challenge was is also you

5056
02:40:26,398 --> 02:40:30,079
have to have some business development

5057
02:40:28,318 --> 02:40:31,680
like it's a bit of a it's a bit of a

5058
02:40:30,079 --> 02:40:32,799
seating problem right and you look at

5059
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:34,318
how i've talked to the folks at linux

5060
02:40:32,799 --> 02:40:35,358
foundation know how they're doing it i

5061
02:40:34,318 --> 02:40:37,760
know how

5062
02:40:35,359 --> 02:40:39,520
in starting num focus because

5063
02:40:37,760 --> 02:40:41,040
we had two babies in 2012 one was

5064
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:42,720
anaconda one was num focus right and

5065
02:40:41,040 --> 02:40:45,040
they were both important efforts they

5066
02:40:42,719 --> 02:40:46,879
had distinct journeys and super grateful

5067
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:48,720
that both existed and still grateful

5068
02:40:46,879 --> 02:40:50,159
both exist um

5069
02:40:48,719 --> 02:40:51,760
but there's different energies in

5070
02:40:50,159 --> 02:40:53,359
getting donations

5071
02:40:51,760 --> 02:40:55,439
as there is getting

5072
02:40:53,359 --> 02:40:57,120
um this is important to my business like

5073
02:40:55,439 --> 02:40:58,880
i'm selling you something that

5074
02:40:57,120 --> 02:41:01,040
this is not a it's a salt is i'm gonna

5075
02:40:58,879 --> 02:41:03,438
make money this way if you can tie it if

5076
02:41:01,040 --> 02:41:05,120
you can tie the message to an roi for

5077
02:41:03,439 --> 02:41:07,680
the company it becomes more effective

5078
02:41:05,120 --> 02:41:09,439
it's much more effective right so

5079
02:41:07,680 --> 02:41:10,639
and there are rational arguments to make

5080
02:41:09,439 --> 02:41:12,159
i've tried to have conversations with

5081
02:41:10,639 --> 02:41:14,159
mark especially marketing departments

5082
02:41:12,159 --> 02:41:14,840
like very early on it was clear to me

5083
02:41:14,159 --> 02:41:16,879
that

5084
02:41:14,840 --> 02:41:18,639
oh you could just take a fraction of

5085
02:41:16,879 --> 02:41:20,719
your marketing budget and just spend it

5086
02:41:18,639 --> 02:41:23,680
on open source development and you get

5087
02:41:20,719 --> 02:41:25,840
better results from your marketing

5088
02:41:23,680 --> 02:41:27,359
like because how do those can i sorry

5089
02:41:25,840 --> 02:41:29,040
i'm gonna try not to go

5090
02:41:27,359 --> 02:41:30,880
here what have you learned from the

5091
02:41:29,040 --> 02:41:32,880
interaction with the marketing folks on

5092
02:41:30,879 --> 02:41:34,398
that kind of because

5093
02:41:32,879 --> 02:41:36,559
you gave a great example of something

5094
02:41:34,398 --> 02:41:38,879
that will obviously be much better

5095
02:41:36,559 --> 02:41:40,398
investment in terms of marketing is

5096
02:41:38,879 --> 02:41:42,000
supporting open source projects the

5097
02:41:40,398 --> 02:41:44,639
challenge is not dissimilar from the

5098
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:47,200
challenge you have in academia at the

5099
02:41:44,639 --> 02:41:49,840
different colleges right knowledge gets

5100
02:41:47,200 --> 02:41:51,600
very specific and very channeled right

5101
02:41:49,840 --> 02:41:53,840
and so people get they get a lot of

5102
02:41:51,600 --> 02:41:56,318
learning in the thing they know about

5103
02:41:53,840 --> 02:41:59,600
and it's hard then to bridge that and to

5104
02:41:56,318 --> 02:42:00,959
get them to think differently enough to

5105
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:02,318
have a sense that you might have

5106
02:42:00,959 --> 02:42:03,599
something to offer because it's

5107
02:42:02,318 --> 02:42:05,278
different it's like well how do i

5108
02:42:03,600 --> 02:42:07,200
implement that how do i what do i do

5109
02:42:05,279 --> 02:42:09,520
with that like do i which budget do i

5110
02:42:07,200 --> 02:42:11,439
take from do i slow down my spend on

5111
02:42:09,520 --> 02:42:13,439
google ads or am i spent on facebook ads

5112
02:42:11,439 --> 02:42:15,359
or do i not hire a content creator and

5113
02:42:13,439 --> 02:42:17,200
say like like there's an operational

5114
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:18,720
aspect to that that some that you have

5115
02:42:17,200 --> 02:42:20,159
to be the cmo

5116
02:42:18,719 --> 02:42:22,799
right or the ceo you have to get the

5117
02:42:20,159 --> 02:42:24,879
right level so you have to hire a high

5118
02:42:22,799 --> 02:42:26,398
position level right because they care

5119
02:42:24,879 --> 02:42:28,159
about this in this right or they won't

5120
02:42:26,398 --> 02:42:30,318
know how right right and and because you

5121
02:42:28,159 --> 02:42:32,159
can also do it very clumsily yeah right

5122
02:42:30,318 --> 02:42:34,318
and i've seen it because you can you

5123
02:42:32,159 --> 02:42:36,239
actually have to honor and recognize the

5124
02:42:34,318 --> 02:42:37,439
the the people you're going to and the

5125
02:42:36,239 --> 02:42:38,478
fact that if you just throw money at

5126
02:42:37,439 --> 02:42:40,398
them it could actually create more

5127
02:42:38,478 --> 02:42:42,478
problems can i just say this is not you

5128
02:42:40,398 --> 02:42:44,239
saying can i just because i just need i

5129
02:42:42,478 --> 02:42:47,599
need i need to say this

5130
02:42:44,239 --> 02:42:50,478
i've been very surprised

5131
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:51,680
how often marketing people are terrible

5132
02:42:50,478 --> 02:42:54,559
at marketing

5133
02:42:51,680 --> 02:42:56,318
i feel like the best marketing is doing

5134
02:42:54,559 --> 02:42:58,159
something novel and unique that

5135
02:42:56,318 --> 02:43:00,318
anticipates the future

5136
02:42:58,159 --> 02:43:01,439
it feels like so much of the marketing

5137
02:43:00,318 --> 02:43:04,318
practice

5138
02:43:01,439 --> 02:43:06,000
is like what they took in school or

5139
02:43:04,318 --> 02:43:07,600
maybe they're studying for what was the

5140
02:43:06,000 --> 02:43:08,478
best thing that was done in the past

5141
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:10,159
decade

5142
02:43:08,478 --> 02:43:12,478
and they're just repeating that over and

5143
02:43:10,159 --> 02:43:14,719
over as opposed to innovating like

5144
02:43:12,478 --> 02:43:17,119
taking the risk to me marketing a great

5145
02:43:14,719 --> 02:43:18,959
point is taking the big risk that's a

5146
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:20,479
great being the first one to risk yeah

5147
02:43:18,959 --> 02:43:22,239
and there's an aspect of data

5148
02:43:20,478 --> 02:43:23,840
observation from that risk right that's

5149
02:43:22,239 --> 02:43:25,279
that's that's you i think because shared

5150
02:43:23,840 --> 02:43:27,040
what they're doing already but it

5151
02:43:25,279 --> 02:43:28,880
absolutely it's it's about i think it's

5152
02:43:27,040 --> 02:43:30,960
content like there's this whole world on

5153
02:43:28,879 --> 02:43:32,398
content marketing that you could almost

5154
02:43:30,959 --> 02:43:34,079
say well yeah

5155
02:43:32,398 --> 02:43:35,599
it can get over you can get you can get

5156
02:43:34,079 --> 02:43:37,840
inundated with stuff that's not relevant

5157
02:43:35,600 --> 02:43:39,439
to you whereas what you're saying

5158
02:43:37,840 --> 02:43:41,520
would be highly relevant and highly

5159
02:43:39,439 --> 02:43:43,200
useful and highly highly beneficial yeah

5160
02:43:41,520 --> 02:43:44,960
but it's it's a it's risky i mean that's

5161
02:43:43,200 --> 02:43:46,640
why sort of uh there's a lot of

5162
02:43:44,959 --> 02:43:48,478
innovative ways of doing that test is an

5163
02:43:46,639 --> 02:43:50,799
example of people that basically don't

5164
02:43:48,478 --> 02:43:52,559
do marketing uh they do marketing in a

5165
02:43:50,799 --> 02:43:54,719
very like

5166
02:43:52,559 --> 02:43:56,559
it's like elon hired a person who's just

5167
02:43:54,719 --> 02:43:58,239
good at twitter for running tesla's

5168
02:43:56,559 --> 02:43:59,920
twitter account

5169
02:43:58,239 --> 02:44:01,199
you know right right that's exactly what

5170
02:43:59,920 --> 02:44:03,040
you want to be doing you want to be

5171
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:04,479
constantly innovating in uh right

5172
02:44:03,040 --> 02:44:05,840
there's an aspect of telling i mean i've

5173
02:44:04,478 --> 02:44:07,119
i've definitely seen

5174
02:44:05,840 --> 02:44:08,880
people doing great work where you're not

5175
02:44:07,120 --> 02:44:10,079
talking about it like i would say that's

5176
02:44:08,879 --> 02:44:11,920
actually a problem i have right now with

5177
02:44:10,079 --> 02:44:13,439
quansite labs once the lab's been doing

5178
02:44:11,920 --> 02:44:15,439
amazing work really excited about it we

5179
02:44:13,439 --> 02:44:16,800
have not been talking about it enough we

5180
02:44:15,439 --> 02:44:18,318
haven't been and there's different ways

5181
02:44:16,799 --> 02:44:19,840
to talk about it there's different ways

5182
02:44:18,318 --> 02:44:22,079
to there's different channels to wish to

5183
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:22,799
communicate right there's also

5184
02:44:22,079 --> 02:44:25,600
like

5185
02:44:22,799 --> 02:44:27,119
i'll just throw some um shade at

5186
02:44:25,600 --> 02:44:29,439
companies i love

5187
02:44:27,120 --> 02:44:31,680
uh so for example irobot i just had a

5188
02:44:29,439 --> 02:44:34,318
conversation with them they make roombas

5189
02:44:31,680 --> 02:44:36,559
sure and uh they i think i love the

5190
02:44:34,318 --> 02:44:39,039
incredible robots but like every time

5191
02:44:36,559 --> 02:44:41,119
they do commerci like advertisements not

5192
02:44:39,040 --> 02:44:44,000
advertisement but like marketing type

5193
02:44:41,120 --> 02:44:48,479
stuff it just looks so corporate

5194
02:44:44,000 --> 02:44:50,478
and to me the incredible maybe wrong in

5195
02:44:48,478 --> 02:44:52,398
the case of irobot i don't know but to

5196
02:44:50,478 --> 02:44:53,840
me when you're talking about engineering

5197
02:44:52,398 --> 02:44:55,920
systems

5198
02:44:53,840 --> 02:44:58,719
it's really nice to show off the magic

5199
02:44:55,920 --> 02:45:02,318
of the engineering and the software and

5200
02:44:58,719 --> 02:45:04,959
all the all the geniuses behind this

5201
02:45:02,318 --> 02:45:06,799
product and the tinkering and like the

5202
02:45:04,959 --> 02:45:08,879
raw authenticity of what it takes to

5203
02:45:06,799 --> 02:45:10,959
build that system versus uh the

5204
02:45:08,879 --> 02:45:12,799
marketing people who want to have like

5205
02:45:10,959 --> 02:45:14,559
pretty people like standing there all

5206
02:45:12,799 --> 02:45:17,519
pretty with the robots like moving

5207
02:45:14,559 --> 02:45:19,199
perfectly so i to me there's some aspect

5208
02:45:17,520 --> 02:45:20,960
it's like speaking to the hackers you

5209
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:22,880
have to throw some

5210
02:45:20,959 --> 02:45:25,839
uh bones some

5211
02:45:22,879 --> 02:45:27,438
some care towards the the engineers the

5212
02:45:25,840 --> 02:45:29,680
developers because

5213
02:45:27,439 --> 02:45:31,920
there's some aspect one for the hiring

5214
02:45:29,680 --> 02:45:33,600
but two there's an authenticity to that

5215
02:45:31,920 --> 02:45:36,318
kind of communication that's really

5216
02:45:33,600 --> 02:45:38,479
inspiring to the end user as well like

5217
02:45:36,318 --> 02:45:39,840
if they know that brilliant people the

5218
02:45:38,478 --> 02:45:42,079
best in the world are working your

5219
02:45:39,840 --> 02:45:43,760
company they start to believe that that

5220
02:45:42,079 --> 02:45:44,959
product that you're creating is really

5221
02:45:43,760 --> 02:45:46,159
it's interesting because your initial

5222
02:45:44,959 --> 02:45:48,159
reaction would be wait there's different

5223
02:45:46,159 --> 02:45:50,239
users here why would you do that to you

5224
02:45:48,159 --> 02:45:51,920
know my wife bought a rumba rumba but

5225
02:45:50,239 --> 02:45:53,680
she and she you know loves developers

5226
02:45:51,920 --> 02:45:55,120
she loves me but she doesn't

5227
02:45:53,680 --> 02:45:56,398
care about

5228
02:45:55,120 --> 02:45:58,560
that yeah

5229
02:45:56,398 --> 02:46:00,079
so essentially what you said is actually

5230
02:45:58,559 --> 02:46:01,119
the authenticity because everyone has a

5231
02:46:00,079 --> 02:46:02,879
friend everyone knows people there's

5232
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:05,439
word of mouth i mean if you worded my

5233
02:46:02,879 --> 02:46:06,639
mouth is so so yeah exactly

5234
02:46:05,439 --> 02:46:08,079
because i think it's the lack of that

5235
02:46:06,639 --> 02:46:09,920
that realization there's this halo

5236
02:46:08,079 --> 02:46:12,159
effect right and also influences your

5237
02:46:09,920 --> 02:46:14,719
general marketing i interesting for some

5238
02:46:12,159 --> 02:46:16,398
stupid reason i do have a platform and

5239
02:46:14,719 --> 02:46:18,719
it seems that the reason i have a

5240
02:46:16,398 --> 02:46:21,439
platform many others like me millions of

5241
02:46:18,719 --> 02:46:23,599
others is like the authenticity and like

5242
02:46:21,439 --> 02:46:25,120
we get excited naturally about stuff

5243
02:46:23,600 --> 02:46:28,000
yeah and like i don't want to get

5244
02:46:25,120 --> 02:46:30,640
excited about that irobot video because

5245
02:46:28,000 --> 02:46:31,920
it's as boring as marketing as corporate

5246
02:46:30,639 --> 02:46:34,239
as opposed to

5247
02:46:31,920 --> 02:46:36,478
i wanted to do some fun this is this is

5248
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:39,279
me like a shout out to irobot is they're

5249
02:46:36,478 --> 02:46:41,199
not letting me get into the robot

5250
02:46:39,279 --> 02:46:43,120
yeah well there's an aspect of that they

5251
02:46:41,200 --> 02:46:44,960
could be benefiting from a from a

5252
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:46,479
culture of modern modularity like

5253
02:46:44,959 --> 02:46:47,839
add-ons and right like that could

5254
02:46:46,478 --> 02:46:49,840
actually dramatically help if you've

5255
02:46:47,840 --> 02:46:51,920
seen that over history i mean apple is

5256
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:53,840
an example of a company like that or or

5257
02:46:51,920 --> 02:46:55,439
the like i i can see i can see what your

5258
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:56,719
point is is that you have something that

5259
02:46:55,439 --> 02:46:58,239
needs to be

5260
02:46:56,719 --> 02:47:00,000
it needs to be adopted broadly the

5261
02:46:58,239 --> 02:47:01,520
concept needs to be adopted broadly and

5262
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,478
if you want to go beyond this one device

5263
02:47:01,520 --> 02:47:05,200
you need

5264
02:47:02,478 --> 02:47:07,039
to engage this community yeah and

5265
02:47:05,200 --> 02:47:09,920
connecting to the the open source as you

5266
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:11,600
said i got to ask you

5267
02:47:09,920 --> 02:47:13,920
your programmer

5268
02:47:11,600 --> 02:47:14,800
uh one of the most impactful programmers

5269
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:16,639
ever

5270
02:47:14,799 --> 02:47:18,559
you've led many programmers you lead

5271
02:47:16,639 --> 02:47:20,159
many programmers

5272
02:47:18,559 --> 02:47:21,359
what are some from a programmer

5273
02:47:20,159 --> 02:47:23,600
perspective

5274
02:47:21,359 --> 02:47:25,600
what makes a good programmer what makes

5275
02:47:23,600 --> 02:47:27,920
a productive programmer is there a

5276
02:47:25,600 --> 02:47:30,640
device you can give to be a great

5277
02:47:27,920 --> 02:47:31,840
programmer great great question and

5278
02:47:30,639 --> 02:47:33,199
there are times in my life i'd probably

5279
02:47:31,840 --> 02:47:35,120
answer this even better than i hope

5280
02:47:33,200 --> 02:47:36,560
maybe give an answer today because i've

5281
02:47:35,120 --> 02:47:37,920
thought about this at numerous times

5282
02:47:36,559 --> 02:47:41,039
like right now i've spent on so much

5283
02:47:37,920 --> 02:47:42,719
time recently hiring sales people that

5284
02:47:41,040 --> 02:47:45,040
your mind is like

5285
02:47:42,719 --> 02:47:47,199
something else on something else but i i

5286
02:47:45,040 --> 02:47:48,479
reflected on the past and also uh you

5287
02:47:47,200 --> 02:47:50,000
know i have some really the only way i

5288
02:47:48,478 --> 02:47:51,760
can do this i have some really great

5289
02:47:50,000 --> 02:47:53,600
programmers that i work with who lead

5290
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:55,200
the teams that they they lead and my

5291
02:47:53,600 --> 02:47:57,200
goal is to inspire them and and

5292
02:47:55,200 --> 02:47:58,640
hopefully help them encourage them and

5293
02:47:57,200 --> 02:48:00,319
be uh help them encourage with their

5294
02:47:58,639 --> 02:48:03,680
teams i would say there's a number of

5295
02:48:00,318 --> 02:48:06,000
things couple things one is um curiosity

5296
02:48:03,680 --> 02:48:07,600
like you i think a programmer without

5297
02:48:06,000 --> 02:48:10,799
curiosity

5298
02:48:07,600 --> 02:48:12,559
is uh mundane like you'll lose interest

5299
02:48:10,799 --> 02:48:14,318
you don't do your best work so it's sort

5300
02:48:12,559 --> 02:48:16,639
of it's an affect it's sort of are you

5301
02:48:14,318 --> 02:48:19,119
you have some curiosity about things

5302
02:48:16,639 --> 02:48:20,719
i think two don't try to do everything

5303
02:48:19,120 --> 02:48:22,319
at once recognize that you're you know

5304
02:48:20,719 --> 02:48:23,760
we're limited as humans you're limited

5305
02:48:22,318 --> 02:48:25,199
as a human and each one of us are

5306
02:48:23,760 --> 02:48:26,159
limited in different ways you know we

5307
02:48:25,200 --> 02:48:28,159
all have our different strengths and

5308
02:48:26,159 --> 02:48:29,920
skills so it's adapting the art of

5309
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:31,840
programming to your skills one of the

5310
02:48:29,920 --> 02:48:33,520
things that always works is to limit

5311
02:48:31,840 --> 02:48:35,600
what you're trying to solve

5312
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:37,120
right so um

5313
02:48:35,600 --> 02:48:38,479
if you're part of a team usually maybe

5314
02:48:37,120 --> 02:48:39,680
somebody else has put the architecture

5315
02:48:38,478 --> 02:48:41,679
together and they've gotten given a

5316
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:44,239
portion for you if you if you're young

5317
02:48:41,680 --> 02:48:45,840
if you're not part of a team is sort of

5318
02:48:44,239 --> 02:48:47,760
breaking down the problem into smaller

5319
02:48:45,840 --> 02:48:50,159
parts is essential for you to make

5320
02:48:47,760 --> 02:48:52,000
progress it's very easy to take on a big

5321
02:48:50,159 --> 02:48:53,600
project and try to do it all at once and

5322
02:48:52,000 --> 02:48:55,359
you get lost and then you do it badly

5323
02:48:53,600 --> 02:48:58,079
and so

5324
02:48:55,359 --> 02:48:59,840
thinking about you know um very

5325
02:48:58,079 --> 02:49:01,520
concretely what you're doing to find you

5326
02:48:59,840 --> 02:49:03,200
know defining the inputs and outputs to

5327
02:49:01,520 --> 02:49:05,920
finding what you want to get done

5328
02:49:03,200 --> 02:49:07,120
um even just talking about that in like

5329
02:49:05,920 --> 02:49:08,478
writing down

5330
02:49:07,120 --> 02:49:10,000
before you write code just what are you

5331
02:49:08,478 --> 02:49:11,519
trying to accomplish and being very

5332
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:14,000
specific about it

5333
02:49:11,520 --> 02:49:16,000
uh really really helps i think um

5334
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:16,879
using other people's work

5335
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:19,040
right

5336
02:49:16,879 --> 02:49:19,920
don't don't be afraid that somehow

5337
02:49:19,040 --> 02:49:22,319
you're

5338
02:49:19,920 --> 02:49:24,559
like you should do it all like

5339
02:49:22,318 --> 02:49:26,959
nobody does stand on the shoulders

5340
02:49:24,559 --> 02:49:26,959
of giants

5341
02:49:28,079 --> 02:49:31,039
but but but don't just copy and paste

5342
02:49:29,920 --> 02:49:33,200
that's particularly relevant in the era

5343
02:49:31,040 --> 02:49:34,880
of codex and the uh you know the

5344
02:49:33,200 --> 02:49:36,720
auto-generated code which is essentially

5345
02:49:34,879 --> 02:49:38,559
i see as an indexing of stack overflow

5346
02:49:36,719 --> 02:49:40,079
right exactly secondly it's like it's a

5347
02:49:38,559 --> 02:49:41,760
search engine it's a search engine over

5348
02:49:40,079 --> 02:49:43,840
stack overflow basically so it's not i

5349
02:49:41,760 --> 02:49:45,840
mean we've had this for a while yeah but

5350
02:49:43,840 --> 02:49:48,398
really you want to cut and paste but but

5351
02:49:45,840 --> 02:49:49,920
but not blindly like

5352
02:49:48,398 --> 02:49:52,719
absolutely i've cut and paste to

5353
02:49:49,920 --> 02:49:53,920
understand but then you understand oh

5354
02:49:52,719 --> 02:49:56,079
this is what this means oh this is what

5355
02:49:53,920 --> 02:49:57,920
it's doing and understanding as much as

5356
02:49:56,079 --> 02:49:59,279
you can so it's critical that's where

5357
02:49:57,920 --> 02:50:01,120
the curiosity comes in if you're just

5358
02:49:59,279 --> 02:50:03,760
blindly cutting and pasting you're not

5359
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:04,800
going to understand and so understand

5360
02:50:03,760 --> 02:50:05,600
and then you know

5361
02:50:04,799 --> 02:50:08,559
be

5362
02:50:05,600 --> 02:50:10,399
uh be sensitive to hype cycles

5363
02:50:08,559 --> 02:50:12,000
right every for every view often there's

5364
02:50:10,398 --> 02:50:13,439
always a oh test driven development is

5365
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,559
the answer oh object oriented is the

5366
02:50:13,439 --> 02:50:16,800
answer oh

5367
02:50:14,559 --> 02:50:18,559
there's always an answer you know agile

5368
02:50:16,799 --> 02:50:20,719
is the answer

5369
02:50:18,559 --> 02:50:22,719
be cautious of jumping onto a hype cycle

5370
02:50:20,719 --> 02:50:24,000
like likely there's signal like there's

5371
02:50:22,719 --> 02:50:25,519
a thing there that's that's actually

5372
02:50:24,000 --> 02:50:28,000
valuable you can learn from but it's

5373
02:50:25,520 --> 02:50:29,680
almost certainly not the answer to

5374
02:50:28,000 --> 02:50:32,959
everything you need what lessons do you

5375
02:50:29,680 --> 02:50:35,200
draw from you having created numpy and

5376
02:50:32,959 --> 02:50:36,799
scipy like

5377
02:50:35,200 --> 02:50:38,240
in service of sort of answering the

5378
02:50:36,799 --> 02:50:40,239
question of what it takes to be a great

5379
02:50:38,239 --> 02:50:42,000
programmer and giving advice to people

5380
02:50:40,239 --> 02:50:45,600
yeah how can you be the next person to

5381
02:50:42,000 --> 02:50:49,200
create a cyborg yeah so one is listen

5382
02:50:45,600 --> 02:50:50,720
to listen to who uh to uh to people that

5383
02:50:49,200 --> 02:50:53,120
have a problem

5384
02:50:50,719 --> 02:50:55,278
right which is everybody right but

5385
02:50:53,120 --> 02:50:57,279
but listen and listen to many and and

5386
02:50:55,279 --> 02:50:58,560
try to uh then do

5387
02:50:57,279 --> 02:51:00,399
like don't you you're gonna have to do

5388
02:50:58,559 --> 02:51:02,000
an experiment you know do fall down

5389
02:51:00,398 --> 02:51:04,239
don't be afraid to fall down don't be

5390
02:51:02,000 --> 02:51:06,398
afraid you're the first thing you do is

5391
02:51:04,239 --> 02:51:07,600
probably going to suck and that's okay

5392
02:51:06,398 --> 02:51:09,599
right

5393
02:51:07,600 --> 02:51:11,120
it's it's honestly i think iteration is

5394
02:51:09,600 --> 02:51:13,040
the key to innovation

5395
02:51:11,120 --> 02:51:15,279
and and it's that it's almost that

5396
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:17,600
psychological um

5397
02:51:15,279 --> 02:51:19,840
hesitation we have to just

5398
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:21,600
uh iterate like yeah we know you you

5399
02:51:19,840 --> 02:51:23,680
know it's not great but next i want to

5400
02:51:21,600 --> 02:51:25,760
be better i mean just just keep learning

5401
02:51:23,680 --> 02:51:28,479
and keep breathing and keep improving so

5402
02:51:25,760 --> 02:51:30,840
it's it's an attitude um and then

5403
02:51:28,478 --> 02:51:34,559
it doesn't take intense concentration

5404
02:51:30,840 --> 02:51:36,880
right good things don't happen just

5405
02:51:34,559 --> 02:51:38,799
it's not quite like tick tock or like

5406
02:51:36,879 --> 02:51:41,199
facebook you know you can't scroll your

5407
02:51:38,799 --> 02:51:43,679
way to good programming right there are

5408
02:51:41,200 --> 02:51:45,439
you know sincere like hours of

5409
02:51:43,680 --> 02:51:47,120
of deep don't be afraid of the deep

5410
02:51:45,439 --> 02:51:48,479
problem like often people will run away

5411
02:51:47,120 --> 02:51:50,720
from something because oh i can't solve

5412
02:51:48,478 --> 02:51:52,318
this and it you might be right but give

5413
02:51:50,719 --> 02:51:53,199
it an hour give it a couple of hours and

5414
02:51:52,318 --> 02:51:55,278
see

5415
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:57,120
and you know just um five minutes not

5416
02:51:55,279 --> 02:51:59,680
gonna not gonna give you that was it

5417
02:51:57,120 --> 02:52:02,399
lonely when you were building sci-pod

5418
02:51:59,680 --> 02:52:03,920
and number hugely yeah absolutely lonely

5419
02:52:02,398 --> 02:52:05,920
in the sense of

5420
02:52:03,920 --> 02:52:07,520
you have to have an inner drive

5421
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:09,439
and that inner drive for me always comes

5422
02:52:07,520 --> 02:52:10,720
from i have to i have to see that this

5423
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:12,398
is right

5424
02:52:10,719 --> 02:52:13,519
in some angle i have to believe it that

5425
02:52:12,398 --> 02:52:14,559
this is the right approach the right

5426
02:52:13,520 --> 02:52:16,720
thing to do

5427
02:52:14,559 --> 02:52:17,760
with scipy it was like oh yeah the world

5428
02:52:16,719 --> 02:52:19,679
needs

5429
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:21,840
libraries in python clearly python is

5430
02:52:19,680 --> 02:52:23,520
popular enough with enough influential

5431
02:52:21,840 --> 02:52:24,559
people that to start and it needs more

5432
02:52:23,520 --> 02:52:26,640
libraries

5433
02:52:24,559 --> 02:52:29,278
so that is a good in itself so i'm going

5434
02:52:26,639 --> 02:52:30,879
to go do that good so find a good find a

5435
02:52:29,279 --> 02:52:33,840
thing that you know is good and just

5436
02:52:30,879 --> 02:52:35,358
just work on it um so that has to happen

5437
02:52:33,840 --> 02:52:38,159
and it is and you kind of have to have

5438
02:52:35,359 --> 02:52:40,559
enough realization of your mission

5439
02:52:38,159 --> 02:52:42,318
to be okay with the naysayer or the fact

5440
02:52:40,559 --> 02:52:43,359
that notably joins you up front in fact

5441
02:52:42,318 --> 02:52:44,639
one thing i've talked to people a lot

5442
02:52:43,359 --> 02:52:46,079
i've seen a lot of projects come and

5443
02:52:44,639 --> 02:52:48,079
some fail like not everything i've done

5444
02:52:46,079 --> 02:52:49,279
has actually worked perfectly i've tried

5445
02:52:48,079 --> 02:52:50,959
a bunch of stuff that okay that didn't

5446
02:52:49,279 --> 02:52:51,920
really work or this isn't working and

5447
02:52:50,959 --> 02:52:54,239
why

5448
02:52:51,920 --> 02:52:55,600
but you see the patterns and one of the

5449
02:52:54,239 --> 02:52:57,279
key things is

5450
02:52:55,600 --> 02:52:58,399
you can't even know

5451
02:52:57,279 --> 02:53:00,159
for

5452
02:52:58,398 --> 02:53:01,840
six months i say 18 months right now if

5453
02:53:00,159 --> 02:53:03,439
you're starting a new project you got to

5454
02:53:01,840 --> 02:53:05,520
give it a good 18 month run before you

5455
02:53:03,439 --> 02:53:07,680
even know if the feedback's there like

5456
02:53:05,520 --> 02:53:08,880
it's you're not gonna know in six months

5457
02:53:07,680 --> 02:53:10,398
you might have the perfect thing but six

5458
02:53:08,879 --> 02:53:12,398
months from now it's still kind of still

5459
02:53:10,398 --> 02:53:13,840
emerging so give it time because you're

5460
02:53:12,398 --> 02:53:15,119
dealing with humans and humans have an

5461
02:53:13,840 --> 02:53:16,719
inertial

5462
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:18,079
inertia energy that just doesn't change

5463
02:53:16,719 --> 02:53:21,840
that quickly

5464
02:53:18,079 --> 02:53:22,879
so let me ask a silly question but uh

5465
02:53:21,840 --> 02:53:24,398
you know

5466
02:53:22,879 --> 02:53:27,199
like you said you're focused on the

5467
02:53:24,398 --> 02:53:28,398
sales side of things currently but

5468
02:53:27,200 --> 02:53:30,079
you know back when you're actively

5469
02:53:28,398 --> 02:53:31,599
programming maybe in the 90s you talked

5470
02:53:30,079 --> 02:53:33,439
about ids

5471
02:53:31,600 --> 02:53:35,439
what's your

5472
02:53:33,439 --> 02:53:38,800
a setup that you have that brings you

5473
02:53:35,439 --> 02:53:40,559
joy keyboard number of screens yeah well

5474
02:53:38,799 --> 02:53:42,159
linux i do still like to program

5475
02:53:40,559 --> 02:53:43,680
somebody's not as much as i used to i

5476
02:53:42,159 --> 02:53:44,398
have two projects i'm super interested

5477
02:53:43,680 --> 02:53:45,680
in

5478
02:53:44,398 --> 02:53:47,039
trying to find funding for them trying

5479
02:53:45,680 --> 02:53:49,200
to figure out some good teams for them

5480
02:53:47,040 --> 02:53:52,399
but i could talk about those um but what

5481
02:53:49,200 --> 02:53:54,000
i yeah what get i'm an emacs guy great

5482
02:53:52,398 --> 02:53:56,559
thank you

5483
02:53:54,000 --> 02:53:59,279
the superior editor everybody i've got

5484
02:53:56,559 --> 02:54:00,959
i've i don't often delete tweets but one

5485
02:53:59,279 --> 02:54:03,520
of the tweets i deleted when i said

5486
02:54:00,959 --> 02:54:05,839
emacs was better than vim and then the

5487
02:54:03,520 --> 02:54:07,520
hate i got it is i was like i'm walking

5488
02:54:05,840 --> 02:54:09,359
away from this

5489
02:54:07,520 --> 02:54:11,200
i do too i i don't push it i mean i'm

5490
02:54:09,359 --> 02:54:12,640
not i'm just joking of course yeah

5491
02:54:11,200 --> 02:54:14,479
exactly it's kind of like but people do

5492
02:54:12,639 --> 02:54:16,478
take the editor seriously they take it i

5493
02:54:14,478 --> 02:54:17,358
did it with your life

5494
02:54:16,478 --> 02:54:19,199
it is

5495
02:54:17,359 --> 02:54:20,640
but uh there's something there's

5496
02:54:19,200 --> 02:54:22,240
something beautiful to me about emacs

5497
02:54:20,639 --> 02:54:23,680
but there's for people that love them

5498
02:54:22,239 --> 02:54:26,079
there's something beautiful to them i

5499
02:54:23,680 --> 02:54:27,760
mean i do use them for quick editing

5500
02:54:26,079 --> 02:54:29,840
like command line if i say quick editing

5501
02:54:27,760 --> 02:54:31,520
i will still sometimes use it but not

5502
02:54:29,840 --> 02:54:32,799
much like it's simple corrective

5503
02:54:31,520 --> 02:54:34,159
correctness single edited character so

5504
02:54:32,799 --> 02:54:36,559
when you were developing sci-fi you were

5505
02:54:34,159 --> 02:54:38,879
using ebx yep siphon numpy are already

5506
02:54:36,559 --> 02:54:40,239
in an e-max on a linux box

5507
02:54:38,879 --> 02:54:43,278
and uh

5508
02:54:40,239 --> 02:54:46,079
cvs and then svn version control git

5509
02:54:43,279 --> 02:54:48,640
came later like git has i love

5510
02:54:46,079 --> 02:54:50,719
distributed branch stuff i think git is

5511
02:54:48,639 --> 02:54:53,760
pretty complicated but i love the

5512
02:54:50,719 --> 02:54:56,159
concept and uh also of course github is

5513
02:54:53,760 --> 02:54:57,840
uh and then git lab make git

5514
02:54:56,159 --> 02:54:59,760
definitely consumable

5515
02:54:57,840 --> 02:55:01,600
um but that came later did you ever

5516
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:03,920
touch lisp at all like what were you

5517
02:55:01,600 --> 02:55:06,079
what yeah emotional feelings about the

5518
02:55:03,920 --> 02:55:08,559
parenthesis great question so i find

5519
02:55:06,079 --> 02:55:10,318
myself appreciating this today much more

5520
02:55:08,559 --> 02:55:11,840
than i did early because when i came to

5521
02:55:10,318 --> 02:55:13,680
programming i knew programming but i was

5522
02:55:11,840 --> 02:55:15,520
a domain expert right and to me the

5523
02:55:13,680 --> 02:55:16,559
parentheses were in the way

5524
02:55:15,520 --> 02:55:18,399
it's like wow

5525
02:55:16,559 --> 02:55:19,519
it's just all this like it just gets in

5526
02:55:18,398 --> 02:55:21,039
the way of my thinking about what i'm

5527
02:55:19,520 --> 02:55:21,920
doing so why would i have all these

5528
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:24,319
right

5529
02:55:21,920 --> 02:55:26,639
um that was my initial reaction to it uh

5530
02:55:24,318 --> 02:55:28,398
you know now as i appreciate kind of the

5531
02:55:26,639 --> 02:55:31,199
structure that kind of naturally maps to

5532
02:55:28,398 --> 02:55:33,358
the to logical thinking about a program

5533
02:55:31,200 --> 02:55:35,040
i can appreciate them right and why it's

5534
02:55:33,359 --> 02:55:37,439
actually you could you you could create

5535
02:55:35,040 --> 02:55:40,960
editors that make it not so

5536
02:55:37,439 --> 02:55:42,398
problematic right honestly um yeah so i

5537
02:55:40,959 --> 02:55:43,919
actually have a much more appreciation

5538
02:55:42,398 --> 02:55:45,760
of lisp and things like closure and

5539
02:55:43,920 --> 02:55:47,120
there's hyvee which is a python you know

5540
02:55:45,760 --> 02:55:48,079
a list that compiles the python byte

5541
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:50,399
code

5542
02:55:48,079 --> 02:55:51,600
um i think it's challenging like

5543
02:55:50,398 --> 02:55:53,439
typically

5544
02:55:51,600 --> 02:55:55,120
these languages are you know i even saw

5545
02:55:53,439 --> 02:55:57,040
a whole data science programming system

5546
02:55:55,120 --> 02:55:59,520
in lisp that somebody created which is

5547
02:55:57,040 --> 02:56:01,200
you know cool but again it's the i think

5548
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:02,720
it's the lack of recognition of the fact

5549
02:56:01,200 --> 02:56:04,640
that there exists what i call occasional

5550
02:56:02,719 --> 02:56:05,840
programmers yes people are never going

5551
02:56:04,639 --> 02:56:07,840
to be programmers for a living they

5552
02:56:05,840 --> 02:56:09,520
don't want to have all this the cuteness

5553
02:56:07,840 --> 02:56:12,880
in their head they want just

5554
02:56:09,520 --> 02:56:14,800
it's why basic you know microsoft had

5555
02:56:12,879 --> 02:56:16,799
the right idea with basic in terms of

5556
02:56:14,799 --> 02:56:19,199
having that be the language of

5557
02:56:16,799 --> 02:56:21,519
visual basic the language of excel and

5558
02:56:19,200 --> 02:56:23,359
um sql sql server they should have

5559
02:56:21,520 --> 02:56:25,040
converted that to python 10 years ago

5560
02:56:23,359 --> 02:56:27,040
but the world would be a better place

5561
02:56:25,040 --> 02:56:29,120
that they had but

5562
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:31,040
there's also uh there's a beauty and a

5563
02:56:29,120 --> 02:56:32,960
magic to the history behind a language

5564
02:56:31,040 --> 02:56:35,040
and lisp you know some of the most

5565
02:56:32,959 --> 02:56:36,318
interesting people in in the history of

5566
02:56:35,040 --> 02:56:38,960
computer science and artificial

5567
02:56:36,318 --> 02:56:41,039
intelligence have used lisp so yes you

5568
02:56:38,959 --> 02:56:42,239
feel well it's back to that language

5569
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:43,680
when you when you have a language you

5570
02:56:42,239 --> 02:56:45,199
can think in it yeah and it helps you

5571
02:56:43,680 --> 02:56:46,559
think about it attracts a certain kinds

5572
02:56:45,200 --> 02:56:49,040
of people that think a certain kind of

5573
02:56:46,559 --> 02:56:51,439
way and then that's that's there okay so

5574
02:56:49,040 --> 02:56:54,080
what about like small laptop with a tiny

5575
02:56:51,439 --> 02:56:55,600
keyboard or is there like

5576
02:56:54,079 --> 02:56:57,680
a screen you know good question i've

5577
02:56:55,600 --> 02:56:59,200
never gotten into the many screens to be

5578
02:56:57,680 --> 02:57:01,040
honest i mean and

5579
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:03,359
maybe it's because in my head i kind of

5580
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:04,640
just i just swap between windows

5581
02:57:03,359 --> 02:57:06,479
like

5582
02:57:04,639 --> 02:57:09,039
partly because i guess i i really can't

5583
02:57:06,478 --> 02:57:10,159
process three screens at once anyway

5584
02:57:09,040 --> 02:57:11,760
like

5585
02:57:10,159 --> 02:57:14,318
i just i'm looking at one and i just

5586
02:57:11,760 --> 02:57:15,600
flip you know i flip an application open

5587
02:57:14,318 --> 02:57:17,199
so

5588
02:57:15,600 --> 02:57:18,880
where it's really helpful is actually

5589
02:57:17,200 --> 02:57:20,159
when i'm trying to you know here's data

5590
02:57:18,879 --> 02:57:21,119
and i want to input it from here right

5591
02:57:20,159 --> 02:57:23,200
that's the only time i really need

5592
02:57:21,120 --> 02:57:25,920
another screen so now because you're

5593
02:57:23,200 --> 02:57:27,840
both a developer lead developers but

5594
02:57:25,920 --> 02:57:30,079
then there's also these businesses and

5595
02:57:27,840 --> 02:57:31,760
there's sales people you're working with

5596
02:57:30,079 --> 02:57:33,600
large companies operations people hiring

5597
02:57:31,760 --> 02:57:35,279
people yeah the whole thing which

5598
02:57:33,600 --> 02:57:37,680
operating system is your favorites

5599
02:57:35,279 --> 02:57:39,680
though at this at this point so linux

5600
02:57:37,680 --> 02:57:41,680
was the earliest so yeah i love love

5601
02:57:39,680 --> 02:57:42,960
linux as a as a server side and it was

5602
02:57:41,680 --> 02:57:46,800
early days i was had my own linux

5603
02:57:42,959 --> 02:57:48,799
desktop um i've been on mac laptops for

5604
02:57:46,799 --> 02:57:50,559
10 years now yeah that this is what

5605
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:52,559
leadership looks like

5606
02:57:50,559 --> 02:57:55,119
as you switch to mac

5607
02:57:52,559 --> 02:57:56,559
okay great yeah pretty much i mean

5608
02:57:55,120 --> 02:57:58,640
just the fact that i had to do

5609
02:57:56,559 --> 02:58:00,879
powerpoints i had to do presentations

5610
02:57:58,639 --> 02:58:02,239
and you know plug in i just couldn't

5611
02:58:00,879 --> 02:58:06,000
mess with plugging in laptops it

5612
02:58:02,239 --> 02:58:09,039
wouldn't project and so uh you mentioned

5613
02:58:06,000 --> 02:58:12,239
also quant labs and things like that uh

5614
02:58:09,040 --> 02:58:13,520
can you give advice on how to hire great

5615
02:58:12,239 --> 02:58:16,239
programmers

5616
02:58:13,520 --> 02:58:18,960
and great people yeah i would say

5617
02:58:16,239 --> 02:58:20,719
produce an open source project

5618
02:58:18,959 --> 02:58:22,398
yeah get people contributing to it and

5619
02:58:20,719 --> 02:58:25,119
hire those people yeah

5620
02:58:22,398 --> 02:58:27,039
i mean you're doing it sort of uh

5621
02:58:25,120 --> 02:58:28,880
you may be perhaps a little biased but

5622
02:58:27,040 --> 02:58:30,319
that's probably 100

5623
02:58:28,879 --> 02:58:32,239
really good advice

5624
02:58:30,318 --> 02:58:33,840
i find it hard to hire i still find it

5625
02:58:32,239 --> 02:58:35,840
hard to hire like

5626
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:36,960
in terms of i don't think like it's not

5627
02:58:35,840 --> 02:58:39,200
hard to hire if i've worked with

5628
02:58:36,959 --> 02:58:42,159
somebody for a couple of weeks

5629
02:58:39,200 --> 02:58:44,880
but a cup an hour or two of interviews i

5630
02:58:42,159 --> 02:58:47,520
i have no idea so that

5631
02:58:44,879 --> 02:58:49,679
instinct that radar of knowing if you're

5632
02:58:47,520 --> 02:58:51,120
good or not that you've you found that

5633
02:58:49,680 --> 02:58:53,359
you're still not able to it's really

5634
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:55,439
hard i mean the resume can help but

5635
02:58:53,359 --> 02:58:57,040
again the resume is like a presentation

5636
02:58:55,439 --> 02:58:59,279
of the things they want you to see not

5637
02:58:57,040 --> 02:59:01,760
the reality of

5638
02:58:59,279 --> 02:59:02,720
of and there's also um

5639
02:59:01,760 --> 02:59:04,960
you know you have to understand what

5640
02:59:02,719 --> 02:59:06,799
you're hiring for there are different

5641
02:59:04,959 --> 02:59:09,119
stages and different kinds of skills and

5642
02:59:06,799 --> 02:59:10,879
so it isn't just

5643
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:13,920
one of the things i talk a lot about

5644
02:59:10,879 --> 02:59:15,920
internally at my companies is that the

5645
02:59:13,920 --> 02:59:18,478
whole idea of measuring ourselves

5646
02:59:15,920 --> 02:59:19,439
against the unit a single axis is flawed

5647
02:59:18,478 --> 02:59:20,799
because we're not it's a

5648
02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:22,159
multi-dimensional space and how do you

5649
02:59:20,799 --> 02:59:24,318
order a multi-dimensional space there

5650
02:59:22,159 --> 02:59:26,318
isn't one ordering so this whole idea

5651
02:59:24,318 --> 02:59:28,079
you you immediately have projected into

5652
02:59:26,318 --> 02:59:30,559
a thing when you're talking about hiring

5653
02:59:28,079 --> 02:59:32,398
or best or worst or better or not better

5654
02:59:30,559 --> 02:59:33,359
so what is the thing you're actually

5655
02:59:32,398 --> 02:59:36,079
needing

5656
02:59:33,359 --> 02:59:38,559
and you can even hire for that there is

5657
02:59:36,079 --> 02:59:41,279
such a thing generally i really value

5658
02:59:38,559 --> 02:59:43,119
people who have the affect

5659
02:59:41,279 --> 02:59:45,600
they care about open source like so in

5660
02:59:43,120 --> 02:59:47,279
some cases their affinity to open source

5661
02:59:45,600 --> 02:59:48,960
is simply a kind of a filter of an

5662
02:59:47,279 --> 02:59:51,760
affect

5663
02:59:48,959 --> 02:59:53,438
however i have found this interesting

5664
02:59:51,760 --> 02:59:55,760
dichotomy between

5665
02:59:53,439 --> 02:59:58,479
open source contributors and

5666
02:59:55,760 --> 03:00:00,478
product creation

5667
02:59:58,478 --> 03:00:03,599
there's i don't know if it's fully true

5668
03:00:00,478 --> 03:00:05,760
but there does seem to be the more

5669
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:08,000
uh the more experience the more affect

5670
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:09,520
somebody has an open source community

5671
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:11,520
the less ability to actually produce

5672
03:00:09,520 --> 03:00:13,520
product that they have

5673
03:00:11,520 --> 03:00:15,600
but the other one's kind of true too the

5674
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:16,640
more product focused star i find a lot

5675
03:00:15,600 --> 03:00:18,399
of people talk to a lot of people who

5676
03:00:16,639 --> 03:00:20,239
produce really great products and they

5677
03:00:18,398 --> 03:00:21,680
they have a they're looking over the

5678
03:00:20,239 --> 03:00:23,520
open source communities kind of wanting

5679
03:00:21,680 --> 03:00:24,479
to participate and play but they've

5680
03:00:23,520 --> 03:00:26,159
played here

5681
03:00:24,478 --> 03:00:27,438
and they do a great job here and then

5682
03:00:26,159 --> 03:00:29,359
they

5683
03:00:27,439 --> 03:00:30,398
don't necessarily have some of the same

5684
03:00:29,359 --> 03:00:32,640
i don't think that i don't think that's

5685
03:00:30,398 --> 03:00:34,398
entirely necessary i think part of it is

5686
03:00:32,639 --> 03:00:35,439
cultural how that's how they've emerged

5687
03:00:34,398 --> 03:00:37,519
except because one of the things that

5688
03:00:35,439 --> 03:00:39,359
open source communities often lack is

5689
03:00:37,520 --> 03:00:40,960
great product management like some

5690
03:00:39,359 --> 03:00:42,800
product management energy that's

5691
03:00:40,959 --> 03:00:45,119
brilliant but you want both of those

5692
03:00:42,799 --> 03:00:46,719
energies in a second place together yes

5693
03:00:45,120 --> 03:00:48,319
you really do and so it's a lot of it's

5694
03:00:46,719 --> 03:00:50,559
creating these teams of people that have

5695
03:00:48,318 --> 03:00:51,278
these needed skills and attributes that

5696
03:00:50,559 --> 03:00:52,799
are

5697
03:00:51,279 --> 03:00:54,640
hard and so

5698
03:00:52,799 --> 03:00:56,239
so one of the big things i look for is

5699
03:00:54,639 --> 03:00:58,000
somebody that fundamentally recognizes

5700
03:00:56,239 --> 03:00:59,760
their need to learn to learn like one of

5701
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:02,398
the values that we we have and all of

5702
03:00:59,760 --> 03:01:04,478
the things we do is learning like

5703
03:01:02,398 --> 03:01:06,478
if somebody thinks they know it all

5704
03:01:04,478 --> 03:01:07,760
they're going to struggle and some of

5705
03:01:06,478 --> 03:01:10,478
that is just

5706
03:01:07,760 --> 03:01:11,359
there's more basic things like humility

5707
03:01:10,478 --> 03:01:13,519
just

5708
03:01:11,359 --> 03:01:14,880
being humble in the face of all the

5709
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:16,319
things you don't know and that's like

5710
03:01:14,879 --> 03:01:18,719
step one of learning that's step one of

5711
03:01:16,318 --> 03:01:21,039
learning right and you know i've spent a

5712
03:01:18,719 --> 03:01:22,079
lot of time learning right other people

5713
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:23,439
spend a lot more time but i've spent a

5714
03:01:22,079 --> 03:01:25,760
lot of time learning i mean my whole

5715
03:01:23,439 --> 03:01:28,159
goal was to get a phd because i loved

5716
03:01:25,760 --> 03:01:29,359
school and i wanted to be a scientist

5717
03:01:28,159 --> 03:01:30,799
and then

5718
03:01:29,359 --> 03:01:32,159
what i found is what's been written

5719
03:01:30,799 --> 03:01:33,920
about elsewhere as well is the more i

5720
03:01:32,159 --> 03:01:35,840
learned the more i didn't know the more

5721
03:01:33,920 --> 03:01:37,439
i realized man i i

5722
03:01:35,840 --> 03:01:39,279
i know about this

5723
03:01:37,439 --> 03:01:40,639
but this is such a tiny thing in the

5724
03:01:39,279 --> 03:01:42,079
global scope of what i might want to

5725
03:01:40,639 --> 03:01:43,439
know about so

5726
03:01:42,079 --> 03:01:45,600
i need to be listening a whole lot

5727
03:01:43,439 --> 03:01:47,680
better than than i am just

5728
03:01:45,600 --> 03:01:48,800
talking

5729
03:01:47,680 --> 03:01:49,840
that's changed a little bit actually my

5730
03:01:48,799 --> 03:01:51,599
wife says that i used to be a better

5731
03:01:49,840 --> 03:01:53,120
listener now that i have i'm so full of

5732
03:01:51,600 --> 03:01:55,359
all these ideas i want to do she kind of

5733
03:01:53,120 --> 03:01:57,680
says you got to give people time to talk

5734
03:01:55,359 --> 03:01:59,439
so you you've uh succeeded on multiple

5735
03:01:57,680 --> 03:02:01,120
dimensions so one is the

5736
03:01:59,439 --> 03:02:02,559
10-year track faculty

5737
03:02:01,120 --> 03:02:04,160
uh the others just creating all these

5738
03:02:02,559 --> 03:02:06,478
products then building up the businesses

5739
03:02:04,159 --> 03:02:08,478
then working with businesses

5740
03:02:06,478 --> 03:02:11,278
uh do you have advice for young people

5741
03:02:08,478 --> 03:02:12,318
today in high school in college of how

5742
03:02:11,279 --> 03:02:13,760
to

5743
03:02:12,318 --> 03:02:17,119
live a life

5744
03:02:13,760 --> 03:02:18,159
as a non-linear and as successful as

5745
03:02:17,120 --> 03:02:20,240
yours

5746
03:02:18,159 --> 03:02:22,318
a life that could be uh they could be

5747
03:02:20,239 --> 03:02:24,079
proud of well like that's that's a super

5748
03:02:22,318 --> 03:02:26,559
compliment i'm humbled by that actually

5749
03:02:24,079 --> 03:02:28,478
i i would say

5750
03:02:26,559 --> 03:02:30,398
a life they can be proud of honestly one

5751
03:02:28,478 --> 03:02:32,799
thing i've said to people is

5752
03:02:30,398 --> 03:02:34,079
first um find people you love and care

5753
03:02:32,799 --> 03:02:36,478
about them

5754
03:02:34,079 --> 03:02:38,159
like family matters to me a lot and

5755
03:02:36,478 --> 03:02:39,278
family means people you love and have

5756
03:02:38,159 --> 03:02:41,680
committed to

5757
03:02:39,279 --> 03:02:43,439
right so it can be whatever you you mean

5758
03:02:41,680 --> 03:02:44,800
by that but it's it you need to have a

5759
03:02:43,439 --> 03:02:46,639
foundation

5760
03:02:44,799 --> 03:02:48,318
uh so find people you love and want to

5761
03:02:46,639 --> 03:02:50,398
commit to and do that

5762
03:02:48,318 --> 03:02:51,680
um because it anchors you in a way that

5763
03:02:50,398 --> 03:02:53,119
nothing else can

5764
03:02:51,680 --> 03:02:55,359
right and then

5765
03:02:53,120 --> 03:02:57,200
and then you find other things and then

5766
03:02:55,359 --> 03:02:58,640
kind of from out there you find other

5767
03:02:57,200 --> 03:03:02,000
kinds of things you can commit to

5768
03:02:58,639 --> 03:03:03,519
whether it's ideas or or people or

5769
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:06,239
groups of people

5770
03:03:03,520 --> 03:03:07,760
um so you know especially in high school

5771
03:03:06,239 --> 03:03:09,199
i would say don't settle on what you

5772
03:03:07,760 --> 03:03:10,159
think you know

5773
03:03:09,200 --> 03:03:12,640
right

5774
03:03:10,159 --> 03:03:14,639
give yourself 10 years to think about

5775
03:03:12,639 --> 03:03:16,079
the world like there's i see a lot of

5776
03:03:14,639 --> 03:03:18,398
high school students who who seem to

5777
03:03:16,079 --> 03:03:20,239
know everything already i i think i did

5778
03:03:18,398 --> 03:03:21,920
too i think it's maybe natural but

5779
03:03:20,239 --> 03:03:23,520
but recognize that

5780
03:03:21,920 --> 03:03:26,398
the things you care about you might

5781
03:03:23,520 --> 03:03:28,319
change your perspective over time

5782
03:03:26,398 --> 03:03:29,599
i certainly have over time as senator

5783
03:03:28,318 --> 03:03:31,119
you know i was really passionate about

5784
03:03:29,600 --> 03:03:33,920
one specific thing and i was kind of

5785
03:03:31,120 --> 03:03:36,079
softened you know i was a big um i

5786
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:36,799
didn't like the federal reserve right

5787
03:03:36,079 --> 03:03:37,840
and

5788
03:03:36,799 --> 03:03:39,438
there's still we can have a longer

5789
03:03:37,840 --> 03:03:40,799
conversation about monetary policy and

5790
03:03:39,439 --> 03:03:42,079
finances but

5791
03:03:40,799 --> 03:03:45,278
but

5792
03:03:42,079 --> 03:03:47,120
i'm a little more uh nuanced in my in my

5793
03:03:45,279 --> 03:03:47,920
perspective at this point

5794
03:03:47,120 --> 03:03:49,279
um

5795
03:03:47,920 --> 03:03:50,398
but you know that's that's one area

5796
03:03:49,279 --> 03:03:52,399
where you learn about someone going i

5797
03:03:50,398 --> 03:03:54,478
want to attack it you know

5798
03:03:52,398 --> 03:03:56,799
build don't destroy

5799
03:03:54,478 --> 03:03:58,318
like build like someone so often the

5800
03:03:56,799 --> 03:03:59,840
tendency is to not like something they

5801
03:03:58,318 --> 03:04:02,079
want to go attack it

5802
03:03:59,840 --> 03:04:04,159
build something build some to replace it

5803
03:04:02,079 --> 03:04:05,520
yeah build up you know attract people to

5804
03:04:04,159 --> 03:04:08,398
your new thing

5805
03:04:05,520 --> 03:04:09,760
you'll get you'll be far more far better

5806
03:04:08,398 --> 03:04:11,920
right you don't need to destroy

5807
03:04:09,760 --> 03:04:14,398
something to build something else

5808
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:17,040
um so that's i guess generally

5809
03:04:14,398 --> 03:04:19,358
uh and then you know definitely

5810
03:04:17,040 --> 03:04:20,720
uh like curiosity you know follow your

5811
03:04:19,359 --> 03:04:22,559
curiosity

5812
03:04:20,719 --> 03:04:24,478
and and let it um

5813
03:04:22,559 --> 03:04:25,840
don't just follow the money

5814
03:04:24,478 --> 03:04:27,519
and all of that like you said is

5815
03:04:25,840 --> 03:04:30,000
grounded in um

5816
03:04:27,520 --> 03:04:31,120
family friendship and ultimately love

5817
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:32,719
yes

5818
03:04:31,120 --> 03:04:35,279
which is uh

5819
03:04:32,719 --> 03:04:37,199
a great way to end it travis you're one

5820
03:04:35,279 --> 03:04:38,880
of the most impactful people in the

5821
03:04:37,200 --> 03:04:42,000
engineering computer science in the

5822
03:04:38,879 --> 03:04:43,438
human world so i truly appreciate

5823
03:04:42,000 --> 03:04:45,359

and now let me leave you with something

5832
03:05:00,079 --> 03:05:04,879
that in the programming world is called

5833
03:05:02,639 --> 03:05:06,879
hodgson's law

5834
03:05:04,879 --> 03:05:09,358
every sufficiently advanced lisp

5835
03:05:06,879 --> 03:05:12,318
application will eventually be

5836
03:05:09,359 --> 03:05:14,159
re-implemented in python

5837
03:05:12,318 --> 03:05:17,879
thank you for listening and hope to see

5838
03:05:14,159 --> 03:05:17,879
