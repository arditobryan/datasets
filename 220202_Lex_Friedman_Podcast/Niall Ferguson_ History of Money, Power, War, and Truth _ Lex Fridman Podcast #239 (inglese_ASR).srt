historians of our time at times

4
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,000
controversial and always brilliant

5
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:13,678
whether you agree with him or not he's

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,960
an author of 16 books on topics covering

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,320
the history of money power war pandemics

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,240
and empire

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,399
previously at harvard currently at

10
00:00:20,239 --> 00:00:24,879
stanford and today

11
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,759
launching a new university here in

12
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:30,719
austin texas called the university of

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,439
austin a new institution built from the

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:36,079
ground up to encourage open inquiry and

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:38,159
discourse by both thinkers and doers

16
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,558
from philosophers and historians to

17
00:00:38,159 --> 00:00:44,000
scientists and engineers embracing

18
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:47,519
debate dissent and self-examination free

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,558
to speak to disagree to think to explore

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,960
truly novel ideas the advisory board

21
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,119
includes stephen pinker jonathan height

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,359
and many other amazing people

23
00:00:55,119 --> 00:01:00,238
with one exception

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:02,479
me i was graciously invited to be on the

25
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,719
advisory board which i accepted in the

26
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:06,959
hope of doing my small part in helping

27
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,280
build the future of education and open

28
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,959
discourse especially in the fields of

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,280
artificial intelligence robotics and

30
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,438
computing we spend the first hour of

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,000
this conversation talking about this new

32
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,519
university before switching to

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,599
talking about some of the darkest

34
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:24,399
moments in human history and what they

35
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:26,478
reveal about human nature

36
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,560
this is the lex friedman podcast to

support it please check out our sponsors

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,960
in the description and now here's my

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,640
conversation with neil ferguson

40
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:38,839
you are one of the great historians of

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
our time respected sometimes

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,640
controversial you've flourished in some

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
of the best universities in the world

44
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,239
from nyu to london school of economics

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,840
to harvard

46
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:49,359
and now to hoover institution at

47
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
stanford

48
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,040
before we talk about the history of

49
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,600
money war and power

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,520
let us talk about a new university

51
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:59,599
you're part of launching

52
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,399
here in austin texas

53
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,879
it is called university of austin

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:09,199
uatx

55
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,399
what is its mission its goals its plan

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,079
i think it's

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,598
pretty obvious

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,440
to a lot of people in higher education

59
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:19,598
that there's a problem

60
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,800
and that problem manifests itself in a

61
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:25,679
great many different ways but i would

62
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,160
sum up the problem as being

63
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,560
a drastic

64
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:32,959
chilling of the atmosphere

65
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,560
that constrains free

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,719
speech free exchange even free thought

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,800
and i had never anticipated that this

68
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:44,239
would happen in my lifetime my academic

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,719
career began in oxford in the 1980s when

70
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,800
anything went one sensed that a

71
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:49,759
university was a place where one could

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,000
risk

73
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:54,239
saying the unsayable and

74
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,759
debate the undebatable

75
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,480
so the fact that

76
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:01,199
in a relatively short space of time

77
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,878
a variety of ideas critical race theory

78
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,878
or wokeism whatever you want to call a

79
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,598
variety of ideas have come along

80
00:03:04,878 --> 00:03:10,079
that seek to limit and quite drastically

81
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:12,878
limit what we can talk about

82
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,480
strikes me as deeply unhealthy and i'm

83
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,079
not sure and i've thought about this for

84
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,479
a long time you can fix it with the

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,159
existing institutions

86
00:03:18,479 --> 00:03:22,399
i think you need to create a new one and

87
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,679
so after much deliberation

88
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,519
we decided to do it and i think

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,840
uh it's a hugely

90
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,560
timely opportunity

91
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
to do what people used to do in this

92
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,840
country which was to create new

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,840
institutions i mean that used to be the

94
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
default setting of america we sort of

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,878
stopped doing that i mean i look back

96
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,640
and i thought why why why are there no

97
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:44,959
new universities or at least if there

98
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:48,000
are why do they have so little impact

99
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,640
it seems like we have the billionaires

100
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
we have the need let's do it so you

101
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:54,079
still believe

102
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,318
in institutions in the university in the

103
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,040
ideal of the university i believe

104
00:03:56,318 --> 00:04:00,719
passionately in that ideal

105
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,719
there's a reason they've been around for

106
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,400
nearly a millennium

107
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:05,919
there is a

108
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,239
a unique

109
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:11,280
thing that happens

110
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,759
on a university campus when it's done

111
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,399
right and that is the transfer of

112
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:18,478
knowledge between generations

113
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:20,000
that is a very sacred activity and it

114
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,879
seems to

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,680
withstand major changes in technology so

116
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:25,040
this

117
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,199
form that we call the university

118
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,520
predates the printing press

119
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,800
survive the printing press

120
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,279
continue to function through the

121
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,840
scientific revolution the enlightenment

122
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:37,119
uh the industrial revolution

123
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:39,918
to this day

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,639
and i think it's because maybe because

125
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:44,240
of evolutionary psychology we need to be

126
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,439
together

127
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,478
in one

128
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,800
relatively confined space

129
00:04:48,478 --> 00:04:53,439
when we're in our late teens and early

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,360
20s for the knowledge transfer between

131
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,040
the generations to happen that's my

132
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,560
feeling about this but in order for it

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,479
to work well

134
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,600
there need to be very few

135
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:07,758
constraints there needs to be a sense

136
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,800
that one can take intellectual risk

137
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,639
remember

138
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,120
people in their late teens and early 20s

139
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,160
are adults but they're inexperienced

140
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,959
adults

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,639
and

142
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:20,079
if i look back on my own time as an

143
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,600
undergraduate saying stupid things was

144
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,359
my mo

145
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:28,560
my way to finding good ideas was through

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,520
a minefield of bad ideas

147
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,399
i feel so sorry for my

148
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,079
for people like me today people age 18

149
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,198
19 20 today

150
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,399
who are

151
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,840
uh intellectually very curious

152
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,918
ambitious but inexperienced because

153
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:49,359
the minefields today

154
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:50,719
are absolutely lethal and you know one

155
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,560
wrong food

156
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
and it's cancellation i said this to

157
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,680
peter thiel the other day

158
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,599
imagine being asked now i mean we were

159
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,038
obnoxious

160
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
undergraduates

161
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,000
there's nothing

162
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,000
that peter did at stanford that andrew

163
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,959
sullivan and i were not doing at oxford

164
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,560
uh and perhaps we were even worse

165
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:17,038
but it was so so not career ending to be

166
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,038
to be an absolutely insufferable

167
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,959
obnoxious

168
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:23,038
undergraduate then

169
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,879
today if we if we

170
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:28,079
if people like us exist today they must

171
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,839
live in a state of of constant anxiety

172
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:32,240
that they're going to be

173
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,239
outed for some heretical

174
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,918
statement that they made five years ago

175
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
on social media so

176
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,599
part of what motivates me is that it's

177
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,560
the desire to give

178
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
uh

179
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:45,519
the means of today a shot at free

180
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,639
thinking and

181
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,959
really

182
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,918
i i'd call it

183
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,159
uh

184
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,159
aggressive learning learning where

185
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,240
you're really pushed

186
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,479
and i just think that stopped happening

187
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,160
on the the major campuses because

188
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,478
whether at harvard where i used to teach

189
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,360
at stanford where i'm now based i

190
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,959
i sense a kind of suffocating atmosphere

191
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,598
of self-censorship

192
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:12,399
that that means people are afraid to

193
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:15,038
take even minimal risk in in class i

194
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:17,598
mean just just take for example a survey

195
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:18,959
that was published earlier this year

196
00:07:17,598 --> 00:07:20,879
that revealed

197
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:23,680
this is of undergraduates in four-year

198
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:26,000
programs in the us

199
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,079
85 percent of self-described liberal

200
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,519
students said they would report a

201
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:31,680
professor to the university

202
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,758
administration if he or she said

203
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,400
something they considered offensive and

204
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,800
something like 75 said said they do it

205
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,478
to a fellow undergraduate that's the

206
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,960
kind of culture that's evolved in our

207
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:45,038
universities so we need a new university

208
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:47,519
in which none of that is true in which

209
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:50,079
you can speak your mind say stupid

210
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,279
things get it completely wrong and live

211
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,598
to to tell the tale there's a lot more

212
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,878
going on i think because when you start

213
00:07:55,598 --> 00:08:00,159
thinking about what's wrong with a

214
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,319
modern university many many more things

215
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,160
suggest themselves and i think there's

216
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,439
an opportunity here to build something

217
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,160
that's radically new in in some ways and

218
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,478
radically traditional in other ways for

219
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,400
example i have a strong preference for

220
00:08:12,478 --> 00:08:16,240
the tutorial system that you see at

221
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,679
oxford and cambridge which is small

222
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,120
group teaching

223
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,720
and and highly socratic in its structure

224
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,079
i think it'd be great to bring that to

225
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,560
the united states where it doesn't

226
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,519
really exist but at the same time i

227
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,879
think we should be doing some very 21st

228
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,718
century things

229
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,440
making sure that while people are

230
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,159
reading and studying classic works

231
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,519
they're also going to be immersed in the

232
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,000
real world

233
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,158
of technological innovation a world that

234
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,200
you know very well

235
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:49,919
and i'd love to get a synthesis

236
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,519
of the ancient and classical which we're

237
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,479
gradually letting

238
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:56,399
fade away with the novel

239
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,480
and technological so we we want to

240
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,480
produce people who can simultaneously

241
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,240
talk intelligently

242
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,320
about adam smith or for that matter

243
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,680
shakespeare or proust

244
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,839
and

245
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:12,399
have a conversation with you about where

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,399
a.i is going and how long it will be

247
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,679
before i can get driven

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
here by

249
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:19,679
a self-driving vehicle allowing me to

250
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,919
have my lunch and prepare rather than

251
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:24,479
focus on the other crazy people on the

252
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,479
road so that's the dream that we can

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,039
create something which is you know

254
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,800
partly classical and partly 21st century

255
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:32,159
and we look around and we we don't see

256
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:34,000
it if you if you don't see an

257
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,679
institution that you really think should

258
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
exist i think you have a more

259
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:41,120
responsibility to create it

260
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,559
so you're thinking including

261
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,240
something bigger than just liberal

262
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,559
education also including science

263
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,680
engineering and technology i should also

264
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,119
comment

265
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:51,439
that

266
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,080
you know i mostly stay out of politics

267
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,920
and out of some of these

268
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,440
aspects of liberal education that kind

269
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,519
of been the most controversial and

270
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,040
difficult within the university

271
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,799
but there is

272
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:06,719
a kind of ripple effect of fear within

273
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,958
that space

274
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,320
into science and engineering and

275
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,879
technology

276
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,879
that i think

277
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,199
has uh has a nature that's difficult to

278
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:19,278
describe it doesn't have a controversial

279
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,560
nature it just has a nature of fear

280
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:22,159
where you're not

281
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,439
you know you're not just saying stupid

282
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,120
stuff as a young 20 year old

283
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
you know

284
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,360
for example deep learning machine

285
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,759
learning is really popular in the

286
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,919
computer science now as an approach for

287
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,360
creating artificial intelligence systems

288
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,319
it's

289
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,600
it is controversial in that space to say

290
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,640
that

291
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,560
anything against machine learning saying

292
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:47,759
sort of exploring ideas that saying this

293
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,679
is going to

294
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:50,799
lead to a dead end

295
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,120
um now

296
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:55,759
that that takes some guts to do as a

297
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,759
young 20 year old within uh within a

298
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:59,278
classroom to think like that to raise

299
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:01,039
that question in a machine learning

300
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,639
course it sounds ridiculous because it's

301
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,360
like who's going to

302
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,799
uh complain about this but the the fear

303
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,919
that starts

304
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,078
in uh

305
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,879
in a course on history

306
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:11,919
or

307
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:14,320
on the

308
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:16,799
some course that covers society the fear

309
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,320
ripples and affects those students

310
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:20,958
they're asking big out of the box

311
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,959
questions about engineering about

312
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,639
computer science and there's a lot you

313
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,078
know there's like linear algebra that's

314
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,639
not going to change

315
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:30,239
but then there's like applied linear

316
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,600
algebra which is machine learning and

317
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,200
that's when

318
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,879
robots and

319
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,720
real systems touch human beings and

320
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:38,799
that's when you have to ask yourself

321
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,440
these difficult questions about

322
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:43,199
about humanity even in engineering and

323
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,240
science and technology courses and these

324
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,839
are not separate worlds in two senses

325
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,839
i've just

326
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,519
taken delivery of my copy of the book

327
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,880
that eric schmidt and henry kissinger

328
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,879
have

329
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,799
co-authored on artificial intelligence

330
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,439
the central question of which is what

331
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,599
does this mean for us broadly

332
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,880
but they're not separate worlds

333
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,959
you know in cp snow's sense of you know

334
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,679
the the chasm between science and arts

335
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,559
because on a university campus

336
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:15,120
everything is contagious from a novel

337
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,239
coronavirus to the behaviors that are

338
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,399
occurring

339
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,680
in the english department

340
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,879
those behaviors if denunciation becomes

341
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,479
a norm

342
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,399
you know undergraduate denounces

343
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,600
professor teaching assistant denounces

344
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,759
undergraduate those behaviors are

345
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,519
contagious and will spread inexorably

346
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:33,759
first to social science and then to

347
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,320
natural sciences and i think that's

348
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,159
that's part of the reason why when this

349
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,920
started to happen when we started to get

350
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,240
the origins of

351
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,879
disinvitation and cancel culture

352
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,720
it was not just a few conservative

353
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,720
professors in the humanities who had to

354
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,920
worry everybody had to worry because

355
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,600
eventually

356
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:54,240
it was going to come

357
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:58,079
even to the most apparently

358
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,200
hard stem part of the the campus it's

359
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,719
it's contagious this is something

360
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,879
nicholas christakis should look at

361
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,160
because he's very good at looking at the

362
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,919
way in which

363
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:08,559
social networks like the ones that exist

364
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,159
in a university can spread everything

365
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,679
but i think when when we look back and

366
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,919
ask why did wokism spread so rapidly and

367
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,519
rapidly out of humanities into other

368
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:20,319
parts of universities and why did it

369
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,159
spread across the country and d beyond

370
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,519
the united states to the other

371
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:25,278
english-speaking universities it's

372
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,120
because it's a contagion

373
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:28,399
uh and and these behaviors are

374
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,679
contagious

375
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,240
the president of a university i won't

376
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,078
name said to me that he receives every

377
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,680
day at least one

378
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:41,519
denunciation one call for somebody or

379
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,679
other to be fired for something that

380
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,799
they said that's the crazy kind of

381
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:48,958
totalitarianism light

382
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,399
that now exists in our uh our

383
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:51,759
universities

384
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,519
and of course the people who want to

385
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,039
downplay this say oh well there only

386
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,959
have been 100 and something in dis

387
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:59,198
invitations or oh there really aren't

388
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:01,039
that many cases but the point is that

389
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:03,599
the famous events the events that get

390
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:06,240
the attention are responsible for a

391
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,920
general chilling that as you say spreads

392
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,198
to every part of the university and

393
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,439
creates a

394
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,359
very familiar culture in which people

395
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,040
are afraid to say what they think

396
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,919
self-censorship look at the heterodox

397
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,319
academy data on this grows and grows so

398
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,759
now a majority of students will say this

399
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,000
is clear from the latest heterodox

400
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:25,759
academy surveys we are scared to say

401
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,360
what we think in case

402
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:29,519
we get denounced in case we get

403
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,278
cancelled but that's just not the

404
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,839
correct atmosphere

405
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,600
for a university in a free society

406
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,240
to me what's really

407
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,800
creepy is how many of the behaviors i

408
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,639
see on university campuses today are

409
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,479
reminiscent of the way that people used

410
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:47,120
to behave in the soviet union

411
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,920
or in the soviet bloc or in maui's china

412
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,560
the sort of totalitarianism light that i

413
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,799
think we're we're contending with here

414
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,399
which manifests itself as

415
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,599
denunciations

416
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:01,360
people informing on superiors

417
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,720
some people using it for career

418
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,199
advantage

419
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,959
other people reduced to hapless

420
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:09,278
desperate apology

421
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,879
to try to exonerate themselves people

422
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,559
disappearing

423
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,399
metaphorically if not literally all of

424
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:16,319
this is so reminiscent

425
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,839
of the totalitarian regimes that i

426
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
studied earlier in my career that it

427
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,480
makes me feel sick and what makes me

428
00:15:20,559 --> 00:15:24,319
really feel sick is that the people

429
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,800
doing this stuff the people who write

430
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,720
the letters of denunciation are

431
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:30,559
apparently unaware that they're behaving

432
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,480
exactly like people in stalin's soviet

433
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,078
union they don't know that

434
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,480
so they clearly have there's been a

435
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:38,319
massive educational failure if somebody

436
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,240
can write an anonymous or non-anonymous

437
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,560
letter of denunciation and not feel

438
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:45,198
shame i mean you should feel morally

439
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:47,359
completely contaminated as you are doing

440
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:49,919
that but but people haven't been taught

441
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:52,560
the realities of totalitarianism for all

442
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,719
these reasons i think you need to try at

443
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:58,159
least to create a new institution

444
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,759
where those pathologies will be

445
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:02,559
structurally excluded

446
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,480
so

447
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,919
maybe a difficult question maybe you'll

448
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,920
push back on this

449
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,039
but you're widely seen politically as a

450
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:10,719
conservative

451
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,399
hoover institution is politically

452
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,560
conservative

453
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,480
what is the role of politics at the

454
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,958
university of austin because some of the

455
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,278
ideas people listening to this when they

456
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:23,198
hear the ideas you're expressing

457
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,278
they may think there's a lien to these

458
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:28,159
ideas there's a conservative lean to

459
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:29,759
these ideas is there such a lien

460
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:33,600
there will certainly be people who say

461
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,839
that because the standard mode of

462
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,639
trying to discredit any new initiative

463
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,880
is to say oh this is a sinister

464
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,919
conservative

465
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:44,000
plot

466
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:46,240
but one of our

467
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,039
co-founders heather heing is definitely

468
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,039
not

469
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:50,559
a conservative

470
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:53,679
she's as committed to the idea of

471
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,679
academic freedom as i am but i think on

472
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,198
political issues we probably agree on

473
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,399
almost nothing

474
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:03,039
and at least i i would guess but but

475
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:04,720
politics max weber made this point a

476
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,639
long time ago

477
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,798
the politics really should stop at the

478
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,640
threshold of the the classroom of the

479
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:12,318
lecture hall and in my career i've

480
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:13,600
always tried to make sure that when i'm

481
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:14,959
teaching

482
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:18,078
it's not

483
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:20,318
clear where i stand politically though

484
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,798
of course undergraduates and insatiably

485
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,798
curiously want to know but it shouldn't

486
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,558
be clear from what i say because

487
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,519
indoctrination

488
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:31,599
on a political basis is an abuse of the

489
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:32,879
power of the professor as weber rightly

490
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:36,399
said

491
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,400
so i think one of the key principles of

492
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,919
of the university of austin will be that

493
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,400
barbarian principle that politics is not

494
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,120
an appropriate uh

495
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,240
subject for the lecture hall for the

496
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:51,279
classroom

497
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,679
and we should pursue truth

498
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:56,399
and enshrine

499
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,160
liberty of thought

500
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,000
if that's a political issue then i can't

501
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,000
help you i mean if you're against

502
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,640
freedom of thought then we don't really

503
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
have much of a discussion to have

504
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,559
and clearly there are some people who

505
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,558
politically seem quite hostile to it but

506
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,558
my sense is that there are plenty of

507
00:18:10,558 --> 00:18:14,720
people on the left in academia i think

508
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:18,240
of that interesting partnership between

509
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:20,960
cornell west and robbie george

510
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,558
which has been institutionalized in the

511
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,798
academic freedom alliance it's

512
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,399
bipartisan this issue it really really

513
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,480
is after all

514
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,320
50 years ago it was the left that was in

515
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,279
favor of free speech

516
00:18:30,319 --> 00:18:34,879
the right still has an anti-free speech

517
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,279
element to it look how quickly they're

518
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,559
out to ban critical race theory critical

519
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,879
race theory won't be banned at the

520
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,879
university of texas wokism won't be

521
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,200
banned everything will be up for

522
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,760
discussion but the rules of engagement

523
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,279
will be clear chicago principles those

524
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,319
will be enforced

525
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,519
and

526
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:56,480
if you have to give a lecture on well

527
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:58,480
let's just take a recent example uh the

528
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,599
dorian abbott case if you're giving a

529
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
lecture

530
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:02,000
on

531
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,919
astrophysics

532
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,558
but it turns out that in some different

533
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:09,200
venue you express skepticism about a

534
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,879
formative action well it doesn't matter

535
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,960
it's irrelevant we want to know what

536
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,880
your thoughts are on astrophysics

537
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,960
because that's what you're supposed to

538
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,559
be doing a lecture on that used to be

539
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,880
understood i mean at the oxford of the

540
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:23,759
1980s there were communists and there

541
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,000
were ultratories at cambridge there were

542
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,319
people who were so reactionary that they

543
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,400
celebrated franco's birthday but they

544
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,639
were also out and out communists down

545
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,559
the road at king's college

546
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,799
the understanding was that that kind of

547
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,200
intellectual diversity was part and

548
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:41,200
parcel of university life and frankly

549
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,759
for undergraduate it was great fun to

550
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,960
cross the road and go from you know

551
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:49,839
outright conservatism ultra tourism to

552
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,200
communism one learns a lot that way

553
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,119
but the issue is

554
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,798
when you're promoting or hiring or

555
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,918
tenuring people

556
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,879
their politics is not relevant it really

557
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,360
isn't

558
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,679
and when it started to become relevant

559
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,678
and i remember this coming up at the

560
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,798
harvard history department late in my

561
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,440
time there

562
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:11,440
felt deeply deeply uneasy that we were

563
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,360
having conversations

564
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:16,880
that amounted to

565
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:18,558
well we can't heart x person despite

566
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,600
their obvious

567
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:23,119
academic qualifications because

568
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:24,000
of some political

569
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,319
issue

570
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,558
that that's not what should happen at a

571
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:31,918
healthy university

572
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:34,720
some practical questions

573
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:36,880
will university of austin be a physical

574
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,679
in person university or virtual

575
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,240
university what are some uh

576
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,880
in that aspect where the classroom is

577
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,599
it will be a real space institution

578
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,360
there may be an online

579
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,000
dimension to it because there clearly

580
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:54,798
are a lot of things that you can do

581
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,558
uh

582
00:20:54,798 --> 00:21:00,480
via the internet but the core activity

583
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:02,879
of of teaching and learning i think

584
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,880
requires real space and i've thought

585
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,799
about this a long time debated

586
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,320
sebastian throne about this many many

587
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,000
years ago when he was a complete

588
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:11,918
believer in let's call it the

589
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,519
metaversity to go with the metaverse i

590
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,919
mean the metaversity was going to happen

591
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:18,079
wasn't it but i never really believed in

592
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:20,320
the metaversity i didn't do moocs

593
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,720
because i just didn't think you'd a be

594
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,759
able to retain the attention b be able

595
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,319
to cope with the scale scaled grading

596
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:29,919
that was involved i think there's a

597
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,200
reason universities have been around and

598
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,280
that they're formed for about a

599
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,159
millennium you kind of need to all be in

600
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:38,720
the same place so i think answer to that

601
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,600
question definitely a campus in the

602
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,519
austin area that's where we'll start

603
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,199
and if we can

604
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,200
allow some of our content to be

605
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,400
available online great we'll certainly

606
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,798
do that

607
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,640
another question is what kind of courses

608
00:21:50,798 --> 00:21:54,319
and programming will it offer is that

609
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,600
something you can speak to what's your

610
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:58,960
vision here

611
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:01,519
we think that we need to begin

612
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,640
more like a startup than

613
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:07,200
like a full service university from day

614
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,200
one so our vision is that we start with

615
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,960
a summer school

616
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,400
which will offer provocatively the

617
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,640
forbidden courses

618
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,400
we we want i think to begin by giving

619
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:21,280
a platform

620
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,038
to the professors who've been most

621
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:24,798
subject to council culture and also to

622
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,400
give an opportunity to students who want

623
00:22:24,798 --> 00:22:28,720
to hear them to come so we'll start with

624
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,519
the summer school that will be

625
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,360
somewhat in the tradition of uh of those

626
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,359
institutions in the interwar period that

627
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,279
were havens for refugees so we're we are

628
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:39,678
dealing here with the internal refugees

629
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,759
of of the work era

630
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,919
we'll start there uh it'll be an

631
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,279
opportunity to test out some

632
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,799
uh some content see what uh students

633
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:51,279
will come uh

634
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:54,480
and spend time in austin to hear so

635
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,158
that's part a that's the sort of uh

636
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:59,120
if if you like the launch product and

637
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,919
then we go straight to a masters

638
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,798
program i don't think you can go to

639
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,640
undergraduate education right away

640
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:08,720
because the established brands in

641
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,240
undergraduate education are offering

642
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,240
something it's impossible to compete

643
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,599
with initially because they have

644
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:18,960
the brand harvard yale stanford and they

645
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:21,038
offer also this peer network

646
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,798
which is part of the reason people want

647
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,798
so badly to go to those places not

648
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,798
really the professors it's the

649
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,759
classmates so we don't want to compete

650
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:32,558
there initially where there is i think

651
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:34,798
room for new entrants is in

652
00:23:32,558 --> 00:23:36,720
a masters program

653
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,359
and the first one will be

654
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,319
in entrepreneurship and leadership

655
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:44,000
because i think there's a huge hunger

656
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,079
amongst people who want to get into

657
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,359
particularly the technology world to

658
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:49,038
learn about those things and they know

659
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:51,199
they're not really going to learn about

660
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,960
them at business schools the people who

661
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,360
are not going to teach them leadership

662
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:57,679
and entrepreneurship are professors

663
00:23:55,359 --> 00:24:00,479
so we want to create something that will

664
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:03,200
be a little like the very successful

665
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,759
schwarzman program in china which was

666
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,440
come and spend a year in china and find

667
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:09,119
out about china

668
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:11,120
we'll be doing the same essentially

669
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,278
saying come and spend a year and find

670
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:15,678
out about technology and there'll be a

671
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:17,200
mix of academic content we want people

672
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,278
to understand some of the first

673
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,798
principles of what they're studying

674
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,240
there are first principles of

675
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,400
entrepreneurship and leadership but we

676
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,240
also want them to spend time with people

677
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,000
like one of our co-founders joe lonsdale

678
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,240
who's been a hugely

679
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,919
successful venture capitalist and and

680
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,759
learned directly from people like him so

681
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,600
that's the kind of initial offering i

682
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,200
think there are other masters programs

683
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:41,918
that we will look to roll out quite

684
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,000
quickly i have a particular passion for

685
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,240
a masters in applied history or politics

686
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,278
and applied history i'm a historian

687
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,759
driven crazy by the tendency of academic

688
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:53,759
historians to drift away from what

689
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:56,319
seemed to me the important questions and

690
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:58,240
certainly to drift away from addressing

691
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:59,759
policy relevant questions so i would

692
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,640
love to be involved in

693
00:24:59,759 --> 00:25:05,038
in in a masters in applied history

694
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,919
and we'll we'll build some programs like

695
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,960
that

696
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,240
before we get to the full

697
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,960
liberal arts

698
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,798
uh experience that we envisage for an

699
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,400
undergraduate program

700
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,679
and that undergraduate program is an

701
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,559
exciting one because i think we can be

702
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,120
innovative there too i i would say two

703
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:27,839
years would be spent doing some very

704
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:29,759
classical and difficult classical things

705
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:32,399
those old divides between arts and

706
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:35,440
sciences but then there would also be in

707
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,519
the second in the second half in the

708
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,679
junior and senior years

709
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:42,400
something somewhat more of an

710
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:45,519
apprenticeship where we'll have centers

711
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,519
including a center for uh technology

712
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:50,240
engineering mathematics

713
00:25:47,519 --> 00:25:52,319
that will be designed to to help people

714
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,720
make that transition from the

715
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:56,399
theoretical to the the practical

716
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,558
so that's the vision

717
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,640
uh and i think like any

718
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:03,440
like any early stage

719
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,360
uh idea we'll doubtless tweak it as we

720
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,200
go along we'll find things that work and

721
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,119
things that don't work

722
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,440
but i have a very clear

723
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:13,839
sense in my own mind of how this

724
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
should look five years from now

725
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:17,119
and i don't know about you i mean i i'm

726
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,880
unusual as an academic because i quite

727
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,399
like starting new institutions and i've

728
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,159
done a bit of it

729
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,759
in my career

730
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,120
you got to kind of know what it should

731
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:27,359
look like

732
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:29,199
after the first four or five years to

733
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,719
get out of bed in the morning and put up

734
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,038
with all the kind of

735
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,440
hassles of doing it not not least the

736
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:38,960
inevitable flack that we we're bound to

737
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,880
take from the educational establishment

738
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,679
and i was graciously invited to be an

739
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,240
advisor to this

740
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,798
university of austin and one

741
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,679
the reason i would

742
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:54,639
love to help in whatever way i can

743
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:57,600
is several so one i would love to see

744
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,400
austin the physical location flourish

745
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:03,278
intellectually and especially

746
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,600
in the space of science and engineering

747
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,400
that's really exciting to me

748
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,558
another

749
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,480
reason is i am still a research

750
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:15,038
scientist at mit i still love mit

751
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,839
and i see this effort

752
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:21,759
that you're launching as a as a

753
00:27:18,839 --> 00:27:24,319
beacon that leads the way to the other

754
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:26,480
elite institutions in the world

755
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,720
i think too many of my colleagues and

756
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,440
especially in robotics

757
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,440
kind of see

758
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,759
don't see robotics as a humanities

759
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,319
problem

760
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:38,319
but to me

761
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:46,840
robotics and ai will define much of our

762
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:49,599
world in the next century and for not to

763
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:51,359
consider all the deep psychological

764
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:54,798
sociological

765
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:57,359
human problems associated with that

766
00:27:54,798 --> 00:28:01,038
to have real open conversations to say

767
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,719
stupid things to challenge the

768
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:03,759
ideas that

769
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,159
of how

770
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:08,558
companies are being run for example

771
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,039
that is the safe space it's very

772
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,038
difficult to talk about the difficult

773
00:28:11,038 --> 00:28:16,000
questions about technology when you're

774
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:18,000
employed by facebook or google and so on

775
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,919
the university is the place to have

776
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,398
those conversations that's right we're

777
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,919
hugely excited that you want to be one

778
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:28,879
of our advisors we we need a a broad and

779
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,278
an eclectic group of people and i'm

780
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,640
excited by the way that group has

781
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:36,398
has has developed uh it has some of the

782
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:39,840
some of my favorite intellectuals are

783
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:41,918
there uh steve pinker uh for example

784
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,439
uh but but we're also you know making

785
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,840
sure that we have

786
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,880
people with experience in

787
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:51,038
academic leadership

788
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,320
and so it's a it's a

789
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:56,480
happy uh coalition of the willing

790
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,798
looking to try to build something new

791
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,759
which as you say will be complementary

792
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:01,119
to

793
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:04,000
the existing and established

794
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:07,519
institutions i think of the academic

795
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:09,038
world as a as a network i've moved from

796
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,319
some major hubs

797
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:15,839
in the network uh to others but i've

798
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:18,960
always felt that we do our best work

799
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:21,599
not in a silo called oxford but

800
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,000
in a silo that that is really a hub

801
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:26,398
connected to stanford connected to

802
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,919
harvard connected to mit

803
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,759
one of the reasons i moved to the united

804
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,720
states was that i sensed that there was

805
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,839
more

806
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,480
intellectual action in my original field

807
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,959
of expertise financial history and that

808
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:41,440
was right it was it was a good move i

809
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,880
think i'd have stagnated if i'd stayed

810
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,120
at oxford

811
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,039
but at the same time i i haven't lost

812
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:48,639
connection with oxford i recently went

813
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:50,558
and gave a lecture there

814
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,720
in honour of sir roger scrutin one of

815
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:56,079
the great conservative philosophers

816
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,159
and the burden of my lecture was

817
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,278
the idea of the anglo-sphere which

818
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:03,120
appealed a lot to roger will go horribly

819
00:30:01,278 --> 00:30:05,440
wrong if

820
00:30:03,119 --> 00:30:07,678
illiberal ideas that inhibit academic

821
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,038
freedom spread all over the anglo-sphere

822
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:14,159
and this network gets infected with

823
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:15,839
these i think deeply uh deeply damaging

824
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,000
notions so

825
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,839
yeah i think we're creating a new node

826
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,679
uh i hope it's a node that makes the

827
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:23,199
network overall

828
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,240
more resilient

829
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,679
and

830
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,120
right now there's an urgent need for it

831
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,640
i mean there are people

832
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:30,158
whose academic careers have been

833
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,720
terminated

834
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:36,000
uh i'll name two who are involved peter

835
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,600
bogosian who was harassed out of

836
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,480
portland state

837
00:30:37,599 --> 00:30:41,278
for the reason that he was one of those

838
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,919
uh

839
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:45,919
intrepid figures who carried out the

840
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,840
grievance studies

841
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,480
hoaxes exposing the utter charlatan ray

842
00:30:49,839 --> 00:30:54,720
going on in many supposedly academic

843
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,038
journals by getting phony

844
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,798
gender studies articles published was

845
00:30:57,038 --> 00:31:01,038
genius and of course

846
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,798
so put the noses out of joints of the

847
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,359
academic establishment that he began to

848
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:07,679
be subject to disciplinary actions so

849
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:10,240
peter is going to be involved and in a

850
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,679
recent uh shocking british case the

851
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,519
philosopher kathleen stock has

852
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,840
essentially been run off the campus of

853
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,839
sussex university in england

854
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:21,439
uh for trans uh for violating the the

855
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:22,558
increasingly complex rules about

856
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,120
discussing

857
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,678
transgender issues and

858
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:29,359
women's rights she will be uh one of our

859
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,000
advisors and i think also one of our

860
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:34,959
founding fellows actually teaching uh

861
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,919
for us in our in our first uh iteration

862
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,519
so

863
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,759
i think we're creating a node that's

864
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,519
badly needed those people i mean i

865
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,679
remember saying this to

866
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,480
the uh the other founders when we first

867
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,360
began to talk about this idea uh to

868
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,640
barry weiss uh and to panic and losses

869
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:55,199
pano canelos as well as to heather heing

870
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,960
we need to do this urgently because

871
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,278
there are people whose livelihoods are

872
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,840
in fact being destroyed by these

873
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,240
extraordinarily illiberal campaigns

874
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:06,240
against them and so there's no time to

875
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,960
hang around and come up with the perfect

876
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,519
design this this is an urgently needed

877
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,519
lifeboat and let's start with that and

878
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:15,038
then we can build something spectacular

879
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,558
taking advantage of the fact that all of

880
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,079
these people have

881
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,079
well they now have very

882
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,480
real skin in the game they they need to

883
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:25,359
make this a success and and i'm sure

884
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,519
they will help us make it a success

885
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:30,240
so you mentioned some interesting names

886
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:32,159
like heather heing barry weiss and so on

887
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,558
stephen pinker somebody i really admire

888
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,600
he too was under a lot of quite a lot of

889
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:36,480
fire

890
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,558
uh

891
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,480
many reasons i admire him one because of

892
00:32:38,558 --> 00:32:44,079
his optimism about the future

893
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,759
and two how little of a dam he seems to

894
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,918
give

895
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,679
about the like walking through the fire

896
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:51,840
there's nobody more zen about walking

897
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,278
through the fire than stephen pinker but

898
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:54,959
anyway you mentioned a lot of

899
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,398
interesting names jonathan height is

900
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,960
also interesting there

901
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,879
um who is involved with this venture at

902
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,440
this early days

903
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,600
well one of the one of the things that

904
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,038
that i'm excited about is is that we're

905
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,359
getting people from

906
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:10,720
inside and outside the academic world so

907
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:13,439
we've got

908
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,519
arthur brooks who for many years ran the

909
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,600
american enterprise very s enterprise

910
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:20,079
institute very successfully

911
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,959
has a harvard role now teaching

912
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:26,798
uh and uh and so he's somebody who

913
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,798
brings i think a different perspective

914
00:33:27,038 --> 00:33:32,319
there's obviously a a need to get

915
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:33,359
uh experienced

916
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:35,918
uh

917
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,079
academic leaders involved

918
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:41,120
which is why i was talking to larry

919
00:33:38,079 --> 00:33:44,240
summers about whether he would join our

920
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:45,518
uh board of advisors uh the chicago

921
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:48,640
principals

922
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:52,798
owe a debt uh to the former president

923
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:54,320
of chicago and he's uh graciously agreed

924
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,839
to be in the board of advisors i could

925
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,119
go on it would become a long and tedious

926
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,079
list but

927
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:03,518
my goal in in trying to get

928
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:05,359
this happy band to form has been

929
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,759
to signal that it's a bipartisan

930
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:09,199
endeavor it is not a conservative

931
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,800
institution that we're trying to build

932
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,960
it's an institution that's committed to

933
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,000
academic freedom and the pursuit of

934
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:18,159
truth

935
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:20,559
that will mean it uh when it uh takes uh

936
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,320
robert zimmer's chicago principles and

937
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,239
enshrines them in its its founding

938
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,359
charter and will make those

939
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,638
uh

940
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,239
something other than honored in the

941
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,519
breach which they seem to be at some

942
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,759
institutions

943
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,280
so the idea here is is to grow this

944
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,560
organically

945
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,000
we need

946
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:38,078
rather like the academic freedom

947
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,398
alliance that robbie george created

948
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,000
earlier this year we need breadth

949
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:44,358
and we need to show that this is not

950
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,159
some kind of

951
00:34:44,358 --> 00:34:48,719
institutionalization of the intellectual

952
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,320
dark web uh though we welcome founding

953
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,199
members of that

954
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,280
that

955
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:56,239
nebulous body it's really something

956
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:58,480
designed for all of academia to provide

957
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,159
a kind of reboot that i i think we all

958
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,320
agree is is needed

959
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,480
is there a george washington type figure

960
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,720
who is is there a president elected yet

961
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,800
or is is who's going to lead this

962
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,959
institution hannah canelos the former

963
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,359
president of st john's is the president

964
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,199
of university of austin and so he is our

965
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:16,880
george washington

966
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:18,559
i don't know who alexander hamilton is

967
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,400
i'll lead you to guess

968
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:23,519
it's funny you mentioned idw

969
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,838
intellectual dark web have you uh

970
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:28,239
talked to your friend sam harris about

971
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:31,039
but any others he um

972
00:35:28,239 --> 00:35:33,679
he is another person i really admire and

973
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,480
i've talked to online and offline

974
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:39,118
quite a bit for

975
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,920
not belonging to any tribe

976
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,880
he

977
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,720
stands boldly on his convictions

978
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,240
when he knows they're not going to be

979
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,159
popular

980
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:50,159
with like he based

981
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:52,559
he basically gets canceled by every

982
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,159
group he sort of he doesn't shy away

983
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:56,159
from controversy

984
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:58,480
and not for the sake of controversy

985
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,319
itself he is

986
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,480
one of the best examples to me of a

987
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,119
person who thinks freely

988
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,599
i disagree with him on a few quite a few

989
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:11,680
things but i deeply admire that he is he

990
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:13,680
he is what it looks like to think freely

991
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,519
by himself it feels to me like he

992
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:17,919
represents a lot of the ideals of this

993
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,679
kind of effort yes he would be a natural

994
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,800
fit sam if you're listening i hope

995
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:23,118
you're in

996
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,880
uh i think in in the course of his

997
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:26,960
recent intellectual

998
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,200
quests he did collide with one of our

999
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,519
founders heather hying so we'll have to

1000
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:33,358
model civil disagreements at the

1001
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:35,440
university of austin it's extremely

1002
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,440
important that we should all disagree

1003
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,800
about many things but do it

1004
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,480
amicably

1005
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,320
one of the things that has been lost

1006
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,760
sight of perhaps it's all the fault of

1007
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,838
twitter or maybe it's something more

1008
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,400
profound is that it is possible to

1009
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:51,119
disagree in a civil way and

1010
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,200
and still be friends i certainly had

1011
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,280
friends at oxford who were far to the

1012
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,039
left of me politically and they are

1013
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,480
still among my best friends so the

1014
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,519
university of austin has to be a place

1015
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,880
where we can

1016
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,679
disagree

1017
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,079
uh

1018
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,480
we can disagree vehemently but we can

1019
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,800
then go and have a beer afterwards

1020
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,280
that's that's in my mind a really

1021
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,039
important part of university life

1022
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,760
learning the difference between the

1023
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:18,639
political and the and the personal so

1024
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,480
sam is a i think a a good example as a

1025
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:24,159
you of a certain kind of intellectual

1026
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,440
hero

1027
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:27,199
who has

1028
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,800
been willing to

1029
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:33,358
go into the

1030
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,519
cyber uh sphere the metaverse and carve

1031
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,440
out an intellectual

1032
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,679
space

1033
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,559
the podcast

1034
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:43,919
and

1035
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:45,039
debate everything fearlessly his

1036
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,680
uh

1037
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,838
essay was really an essay on black lives

1038
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:54,239
matter and the question of police

1039
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:55,599
racism was a masterpiece of 2020

1040
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,838
and

1041
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:59,519
and so he i think is a

1042
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,199
a model of what

1043
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,838
we believe in

1044
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,118
but we can't save the world with

1045
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:06,880
podcasts good though

1046
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,760
yours is

1047
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,760
because there's a kind of

1048
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,079
solo element

1049
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,640
to this form of public intellectual

1050
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,039
activities it's also there in substance

1051
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:20,879
where all our best writers

1052
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:22,480
now seem to be including our founder

1053
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,519
barry weiss

1054
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,719
the danger with this uh approach is

1055
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:28,880
ultimately

1056
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:31,039
your subscribers are the people who

1057
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,920
already agree with you and we are all

1058
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,599
therefore in danger of preaching

1059
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,200
to the choir

1060
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,960
i think what makes an institution like

1061
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:41,358
university of austin so attractive is

1062
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,320
that we get everybody together

1063
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:45,598
uh at least part of the year

1064
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,680
and we

1065
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,119
do that informal interaction at lunch

1066
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,519
at dinner

1067
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,200
uh that allows

1068
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:59,199
in my experience the best ideas to form

1069
00:38:57,199 --> 00:39:01,598
intellectual activity isn't really a

1070
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:03,759
solo voyage historians often make it

1071
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,800
seem that way but i've realized over

1072
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,000
time that

1073
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,480
i do my best work in a collaborative way

1074
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,320
and scientists have been better at this

1075
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,320
than people in the humanities

1076
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,519
but what really matters what what's

1077
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,640
magical about a good university is that

1078
00:39:16,519 --> 00:39:21,358
interdisciplinary serendipitous

1079
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:23,279
conversation that happens on campus

1080
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:24,960
tom sergeant the great nobel

1081
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,079
prize-winning economist and i used to

1082
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,920
have these

1083
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:30,240
kind of random conversations in

1084
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:32,800
elevators at nyu or in corridors at

1085
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:35,598
stanford and sometimes they'd be quite

1086
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,920
short conversations but in that short

1087
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,960
serendipitous exchange

1088
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,440
i would have

1089
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,000
more intellectual stimulus than in in

1090
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,119
many a seminar lasting an hour and a

1091
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,199
half so

1092
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,760
i think we want to get the sam harris's

1093
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,358
and and lex friedman's out of their

1094
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:54,640
darkened rooms

1095
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:56,719
and give them a chance to interact in a

1096
00:39:54,639 --> 00:40:00,159
much less structured

1097
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:02,559
way than we've got got used to again

1098
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:05,039
it's that it's that sense that sometimes

1099
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:07,119
you need some free willing unstructured

1100
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:08,960
debate to get the really good ideas i

1101
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,480
mean to talk anecdotally for a moment i

1102
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,639
look back on my oxford

1103
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,159
undergraduate experience and i wrote a

1104
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,480
lot of essays and attended a lot of

1105
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:18,960
classes but intellectually the most

1106
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:21,280
important thing i did was to write an

1107
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,400
essay on the viennese satirist carl

1108
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
krause

1109
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,838
for

1110
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,920
a an undergraduate discussion group

1111
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:30,400
called the cannon club and i probably

1112
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:32,400
put more work into that paper than i put

1113
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,760
into anything else except maybe my final

1114
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,800
examinations

1115
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,560
even although

1116
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,960
there was only really one senior member

1117
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,159
present the historian jeremy cato i was

1118
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,760
really just trying to impress my

1119
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,318
contemporaries

1120
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,599
and that's the kind of thing

1121
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:47,679
we want

1122
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,760
the great intellectuals

1123
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,039
the great intellectual leaps forward

1124
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,000
occurred

1125
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:56,079
often in somewhat unstructured settings

1126
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:59,519
i'm from scotland you can tell

1127
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,680
from my accent a little at least

1128
00:40:59,519 --> 00:41:05,119
the enlightenment happened in late 18th

1129
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:07,358
century scotland in a very interesting

1130
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,318
interplay between the universities which

1131
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:12,159
were very important glasgow edinburgh st

1132
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:15,759
andrews and

1133
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:17,838
the coffee houses and and pubs of uh the

1134
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:20,640
scottish cities where

1135
00:41:17,838 --> 00:41:23,039
a lot of unstructured discussion often

1136
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:24,000
fueled by copious amounts of wine to

1137
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:26,400
place

1138
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,559
that's what i've missed over the last

1139
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,559
few years let's let's just think about

1140
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:33,679
how hard academic social life has become

1141
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:35,838
that

1142
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:37,679
we've reached the point

1143
00:41:35,838 --> 00:41:40,480
that amy chua

1144
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:43,838
becomes the object of a full-blown

1145
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,599
investigation and media storm for

1146
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:47,920
inviting to

1147
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:49,039
yale law school students over to her

1148
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,639
house

1149
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:52,000
to talk

1150
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:54,480
i mean when i was at oxford it was

1151
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,920
regarded as a tremendous honor to be

1152
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,599
asked to go to one of our tutors homes

1153
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,200
the social life of oxford and cambridge

1154
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:03,359
is one of their great strengths there's

1155
00:42:01,199 --> 00:42:06,559
a sort of requirement to

1156
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:08,480
sip unpleasant sherry with the dons and

1157
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:10,078
we've kind of killed all that we've

1158
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,318
killed all that in the us because nobody

1159
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,800
dares have a social interaction with an

1160
00:42:12,318 --> 00:42:16,719
undergraduate or exchange an informal

1161
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,800
email in case the whole thing ends up on

1162
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:20,799
the front page of the local or student

1163
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,880
newspaper so that that's what we need to

1164
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,839
kind of restore the

1165
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,760
the social life of academia so there's

1166
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:29,358
magic we didn't really address it sort

1167
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,920
of explicitly

1168
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:34,559
but there's magic to the interaction

1169
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:36,720
between students there's magic

1170
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,318
in the interaction between

1171
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,838
faculty the people that teach and

1172
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:41,679
there's the magic and the interaction

1173
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,920
between the students and the faculty and

1174
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,919
it's it's an iterative process that

1175
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,440
changes everybody involved

1176
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:50,240
so it's like world experts in a

1177
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,599
particular discipline are changed

1178
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,879
as much as the students as the 20 year

1179
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,960
olds with the

1180
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,960
with the wild ideas

1181
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,039
each are changed and that's the magic of

1182
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,440
it that applies in liberal education

1183
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,199
that applies in this in the sciences too

1184
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,519
that's probably maybe you can speak to

1185
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:09,439
this why so much

1186
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:11,920
scientific innovation has happened in

1187
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:13,519
universities there's something about the

1188
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,519
youthful energy

1189
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,440
of like young minds

1190
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:19,440
graduate students undergraduate students

1191
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,960
that inspire some of the world experts

1192
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,440
to do some of the best work of their

1193
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:25,440
lives yeah well the human brain we know

1194
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,200
is at its most dynamic uh when people

1195
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,800
are pretty young

1196
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,039
you know this with your background in

1197
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,880
math people don't get better at math

1198
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,000
after the age of 30.

1199
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,720
and

1200
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,400
this is important when you think about

1201
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:41,279
the intergenerational character of

1202
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,639
university the older

1203
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,079
people the professors have the

1204
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,199
experience

1205
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:48,880
but they're fading intellectually from

1206
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,159
much earlier than anybody really wants

1207
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,680
to admit

1208
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:53,759
and so you get

1209
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,679
this intellectual

1210
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:57,760
shot in the arm

1211
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:59,279
from hanging out with people who are

1212
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,240
circa 20

1213
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,160
don't know [ __ ] but the brains are kind

1214
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,759
of like cooking yeah

1215
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:07,519
i look back on

1216
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,200
the career i've had in teaching which is

1217
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:13,119
over 25 years where cambridge oxford nyu

1218
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,439
harvard and uh

1219
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,760
i have extremely strong relationships

1220
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:19,440
with with students uh from those

1221
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:21,359
institutions

1222
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,400
because

1223
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:24,239
they would

1224
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,000
show up whether it was at office hours

1225
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:28,000
or in tutorials

1226
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,079
and disagree with me

1227
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,838
and for me it's always been about

1228
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,039
encouraging

1229
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:37,199
some active intellectual rebellion

1230
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,440
telling people i don't want your essay

1231
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,598
to echo my views if you can find

1232
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,280
something wrong with what i wrote great

1233
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,280
or if you can find something i missed

1234
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,040
that's new fantastic

1235
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,880
so there is definitely as you said a

1236
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:50,559
magic in that interaction across the

1237
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,358
generations and

1238
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,599
it's extraordinarily difficult i think

1239
00:44:53,358 --> 00:44:57,199
for an intellectual to make the same

1240
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:00,160
progress

1241
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:02,399
in a project in isolation

1242
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:04,960
compared with the progress that can be

1243
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,519
made in these very very special

1244
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:10,559
communities what does a university do

1245
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:13,039
amongst other things it creates a

1246
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,440
somewhat artificial environment

1247
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,480
of of abnormal job security that's the

1248
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:20,960
whole idea of giving people tenure

1249
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,559
and then a relatively high turnover new

1250
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,039
faces each year

1251
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:26,078
and an institutionalization

1252
00:45:25,039 --> 00:45:27,440
of

1253
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:28,880
thought experiments and actual

1254
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,480
experiments

1255
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,079
and then you get everybody living in the

1256
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,800
same kind of vicinity so that it can

1257
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:37,359
spill over into 3 a.m conversation well

1258
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,680
that that always seems to me to be

1259
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,598
a pretty potent combination let's ask

1260
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,838
ourselves a counterfactual question next

1261
00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:47,599
let's imagine let's imagine that

1262
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:51,119
uh the the world wars happen

1263
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:53,039
but but there are no universities

1264
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,480
i mean how does the manhattan project

1265
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:59,279
happen with with no academia to take

1266
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,039
just one of many examples in truth how

1267
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,240
does britain even stay in the war

1268
00:46:01,039 --> 00:46:07,039
without bletchley park without uh be

1269
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:10,000
being able to crack the german

1270
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:10,800
uh cipher the academics

1271
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,358
are

1272
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,119
unsung partly sung heroes of these

1273
00:46:13,358 --> 00:46:16,960
conflicts

1274
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,519
the same is true in the soviet union the

1275
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,679
soviet union was a terribly evil and

1276
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:25,039
repressive system but it was good at

1277
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:27,919
science and that kept it in the game not

1278
00:46:25,039 --> 00:46:30,318
only in in world war ii kept it in the

1279
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:31,760
cold war so

1280
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:35,039
it's clear that universities are

1281
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:38,240
incredibly powerful intellectual force

1282
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,599
multipliers and our our history without

1283
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:41,598
them

1284
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,039
would look very different sure some

1285
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,000
innovations would have happened without

1286
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,000
them that's clear the industrial

1287
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:48,400
revolution didn't need universities in

1288
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,838
fact they played a very marginal role in

1289
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,920
the key technological breakthroughs of

1290
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:52,880
the industrial revolution in its first

1291
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,880
phase

1292
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,640
but by the second industrial revolution

1293
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,480
in the late 19th century

1294
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:59,920
german industry would not have leapt

1295
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,480
ahead of british industry if the

1296
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,960
universities had not been superior and

1297
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,240
it was the fact that the germans

1298
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,639
institutionalized scientific research in

1299
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:11,679
the way that they did that really

1300
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:14,000
produced a powerful powerful advantage

1301
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,838
uh the problem was that

1302
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,000
this is a really interesting point that

1303
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,480
friedrich meinecker makes in d deutsche

1304
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,559
catestor for the german catastrophe

1305
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:26,079
the german intellectuals became

1306
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:28,720
technocrats homo faber he says they knew

1307
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:31,119
a great deal about their speciality but

1308
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:33,039
they were alienated from broadly

1309
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,880
speaking humanism and that is his

1310
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:37,358
explanation one of his explanations for

1311
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:40,559
why this very scientifically advanced

1312
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:42,000
germany goes down the path of hell led

1313
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:44,000
by hitler

1314
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,079
so when i come back and ask myself what

1315
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,760
is it that we want to do with a new

1316
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,079
university

1317
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:53,200
we want to make sure that we we don't

1318
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,039
fall into that that german pit where

1319
00:47:53,199 --> 00:47:58,000
very high levels of technical and

1320
00:47:55,039 --> 00:47:59,679
scientific expertise are decoupled from

1321
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,920
the fundamental

1322
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:04,159
foundations of

1323
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,838
of a free society

1324
00:48:04,159 --> 00:48:07,920
so liberal arts are there i think to

1325
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:10,239
stop the scientists

1326
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,680
making fausty impacts and that that's

1327
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:13,759
why it's really important that people

1328
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,358
working on ai

1329
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,440
read shakespeare

1330
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:19,598
i think you

1331
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:21,679
said the academics are unsung heroes of

1332
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:25,119
the 20th century

1333
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:27,118
i think there's kind of an intellectual

1334
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:29,599
a lazy intellectual

1335
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:32,000
desire to kind of

1336
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:33,519
destroy the academics that the academics

1337
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:34,719
are the source of all problems in the

1338
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:37,039
world

1339
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:39,358
and i personally believe that exactly as

1340
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:42,639
you said we need to recognize that

1341
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:45,199
the university is probably where

1342
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:48,719
the ideas that will protect us from the

1343
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,919
catastrophes that are looming

1344
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,919
ahead of us

1345
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,920
is that's where those ideas are going to

1346
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,039
come from people who who work on

1347
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,440
economics can argue back and forth about

1348
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:00,800
john main arcanes

1349
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,039
but i think it's pretty clear that he

1350
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,318
was the most important economist

1351
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:06,719
and certainly the most influential

1352
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:09,440
economist of the 20th century and i

1353
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:10,639
think his ideas are looking

1354
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,318
better

1355
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,719
today in the wake of the financial

1356
00:49:12,318 --> 00:49:17,519
crisis than they have at any time since

1357
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:19,199
the 1970s but imagine

1358
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:21,039
imagine john maynard keynes without

1359
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:23,279
cambridge you can't

1360
00:49:21,039 --> 00:49:24,719
because someone like that doesn't

1361
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:26,559
actually

1362
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:29,279
doesn't actually exist

1363
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,040
without the incredible hot house

1364
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,440
that a place like cambridge wars in

1365
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:36,159
keynes's life he was a product of a kind

1366
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,760
of hereditary intellectual elite

1367
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:40,719
it had its vices

1368
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:42,800
but you can't help but admire the sheer

1369
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:45,838
power of the mind i've spent a lot of my

1370
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:49,280
career reading keynes and i i revere

1371
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:51,599
that intellect it's so so powerful

1372
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,839
but you can't have people like that if

1373
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,599
you're not prepared to have

1374
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,119
king's college cambridge

1375
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,559
and and it comes with redundancy i think

1376
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:00,720
that's the point there are lots and lots

1377
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:02,240
of things that are very annoying about

1378
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:03,838
academic life

1379
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:05,439
that you just have to

1380
00:50:03,838 --> 00:50:07,519
you have to deal with they're they're

1381
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:09,920
made fun of in that recent netflix

1382
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:12,960
series the chair and it is easy to make

1383
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:15,599
fun of academic life uh tom sharpe's

1384
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,519
porterhouse blue did it it's it's an

1385
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,800
inherently comical

1386
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:21,280
subject

1387
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,200
professors at least used to be amusingly

1388
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,760
eccentric

1389
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:28,960
but we've sort of killed off that

1390
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,040
side of academia by turning it into

1391
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,199
an increasingly

1392
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:35,838
doctrinaire place

1393
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:37,358
where eccentricity is not tolerated i'll

1394
00:50:35,838 --> 00:50:39,519
give you an illustration of this i had a

1395
00:50:37,358 --> 00:50:41,279
call this morning from a british

1396
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:43,039
academic

1397
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:45,200
who said can you can you give me some

1398
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:48,558
advice because they're trying to

1399
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:50,480
decolonize the curriculum

1400
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:53,519
this is coming from the

1401
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,920
diversity equity and inclusion officers

1402
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:57,838
and it seems to me that what they're

1403
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,920
requiring of us is a fundamental

1404
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:01,199
violation of academic freedom because it

1405
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,760
is

1406
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,358
determining ex-ante what we should study

1407
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,800
and teach

1408
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:10,799
that's what's going on and that's the

1409
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,880
thing that we really really have to

1410
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,200
resist because that kills the university

1411
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,240
that's that's the moment that it stops

1412
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:18,399
being

1413
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:20,078
the magical place of intellectual

1414
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:22,079
creativity

1415
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,920
and simply becomes an adjunct of the

1416
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,280
ministry of propaganda

1417
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,119
i've loved

1418
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:28,960
the time we spent talking about this

1419
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:31,200
because it's such a hopeful message for

1420
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:33,838
the future of the university that

1421
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:35,118
i still share with you

1422
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:37,679
uh

1423
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:40,079
the love of the ideal of the university

1424
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:42,960
so very practical question you mentioned

1425
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:42,960
uh summer

1426
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:46,960
which summer are we talking about so

1427
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,000
when uh i know we don't want to put hard

1428
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:51,039
dates

1429
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,639
here but what year are we thinking about

1430
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,400
when is this thing launching what are

1431
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:57,920
your thoughts on this we are moving as

1432
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,318
fast as our resources allow uh the goal

1433
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:02,559
is to offer the first uh of the

1434
00:52:00,318 --> 00:52:04,400
forbidden courses uh next summer summer

1435
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,040
of 2022 and

1436
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,400
we hope to be able to launch an initial

1437
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:10,880
uh

1438
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,160
albeit relatively small scale masters

1439
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,318
program

1440
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,399
in the fall of next year

1441
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:17,519
that's that's as fast as is humanly

1442
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,000
possible

1443
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:21,838
uh so yeah we're really we're really

1444
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,838
keen to get going and i think the the

1445
00:52:21,838 --> 00:52:25,279
approach we're taking is

1446
00:52:23,838 --> 00:52:26,960
uh

1447
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,880
somewhat imported from silicon valley

1448
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,159
think of this as a startup

1449
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,838
don't think of this as something that

1450
00:52:30,159 --> 00:52:33,920
has to exist as a full service

1451
00:52:31,838 --> 00:52:35,279
university on on day one

1452
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,720
we don't have the results of that you

1453
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,200
need billions and billions of dollars to

1454
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:41,039
build a university sort of as a as a

1455
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:42,318
facsimile of an existing university but

1456
00:52:41,039 --> 00:52:44,639
that's not what we want to do i mean

1457
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,400
copying copying and pasting harvard or

1458
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:48,400
year or stanford would be a futile thing

1459
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:50,240
to do they would probably you very

1460
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,358
quickly end up with the same pathologies

1461
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:53,199
so we do have to come up with a

1462
00:52:51,358 --> 00:52:54,639
different design and one way of doing

1463
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:56,719
that is to grow it organically from

1464
00:52:54,639 --> 00:52:58,639
something quite small

1465
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:00,959
elon musk

1466
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:01,920
mentioned in his usual humorous way on

1467
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,639
twitter

1468
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:08,159
that he wants to launch the texas

1469
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:09,279
institute of technology and science

1470
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,199
tits

1471
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:13,760
some people thought this was sexist

1472
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:15,199
because of the acronym tits

1473
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:17,680
so first of all i understand their

1474
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:19,358
viewpoint uh but i also think there

1475
00:53:17,679 --> 00:53:20,318
needs to be a place for humor on the

1476
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:22,880
internet

1477
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:25,199
even from ceo so on this podcast i've

1478
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,318
gotten a chance to talk to quite a few

1479
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,439
ceos

1480
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:32,159
and what i love to see is authenticity

1481
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,559
and humor is often a sign of

1482
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:37,358
authenticity the

1483
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,920
the quirkiness that you mentioned is

1484
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:41,440
such a beautiful characteristic of

1485
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,480
professors and faculty and great

1486
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,960
universities

1487
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,960
is also beautiful to see as ceos

1488
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:48,480
especially founding ceo so

1489
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,000
anyway

1490
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:52,159
the deeper

1491
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,440
point he was making is showing an

1492
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:56,399
excitement for the university as a place

1493
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,920
for big

1494
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,639
ideas in

1495
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:03,440
science technology engineering so to me

1496
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:05,838
if there's some kind of way if there is

1497
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,519
a serious thought that he had behind

1498
00:54:05,838 --> 00:54:10,159
this tweet

1499
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:11,519
not to analyze elon musk's twitter like

1500
00:54:10,159 --> 00:54:13,358
it's shakespeare but if there's a

1501
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:16,559
serious thought

1502
00:54:13,358 --> 00:54:18,719
um i would love to see him supporting

1503
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:20,880
the the flourishing of austin as a place

1504
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:24,318
for science technology for these kinds

1505
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:27,519
of intellectual developments that uh

1506
00:54:24,318 --> 00:54:29,679
that that we're talking about like make

1507
00:54:27,519 --> 00:54:31,599
make a place for free inquiry

1508
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:33,039
civil disagreements

1509
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,000
coupled with

1510
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:37,679
great education and conversations about

1511
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:38,480
artificial intelligence about technology

1512
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:41,598
about

1513
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,280
engineering so i'm actually gonna uh

1514
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,359
i hope there's a serious idea behind

1515
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,720
that tweet and i'm gonna i'm gonna chat

1516
00:54:45,358 --> 00:54:50,159
with him about it i do too i do too i uh

1517
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,039
most of the

1518
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,159
uh

1519
00:54:51,039 --> 00:54:56,318
biggest uh

1520
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:57,598
storms and teacups of my academic career

1521
00:54:56,318 --> 00:55:00,798
have been

1522
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,480
caused by bad jokes that i've made

1523
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:05,920
these days if you want to make

1524
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,920
bad jokes being a billionaire is a great

1525
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:11,358
idea uh

1526
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:14,159
i'm not here to defend elon's uh

1527
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:16,558
twitter style or sense of humor

1528
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:18,719
he's not gonna be remembered for his

1529
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,880
tweets i think uh he's gonna be

1530
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:22,959
remembered for the astonishing

1531
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,400
companies that he's built and his his

1532
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,639
contributions

1533
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:30,798
in a whole range of of fields

1534
00:55:26,639 --> 00:55:33,440
from spacex to tesla

1535
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:34,559
and solar energy and i very much hope

1536
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:37,440
that we can

1537
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,839
interest elon in this project we need

1538
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:41,838
not only elon but a whole range of uh

1539
00:55:39,838 --> 00:55:43,039
his peers

1540
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:44,558
because

1541
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,480
this takes

1542
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:48,798
resources universities are not cheap

1543
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,240
things to run especially

1544
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:53,280
if as i hope we can make as much of

1545
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:55,759
uh

1546
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,839
the the tuition

1547
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,040
uh covered by scholarships and bursaries

1548
00:55:57,838 --> 00:56:02,480
we we want to attract the best

1549
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:04,639
intellectual talent

1550
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,639
to this institution

1551
00:56:04,639 --> 00:56:08,798
the best intellectual talent is somewhat

1552
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:10,318
randomly distributed through society and

1553
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:11,920
some of it is in the bottom quintile of

1554
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:13,519
the income distribution

1555
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,960
and that makes it hard to get to elite

1556
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:17,440
education so

1557
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,480
this will take resources

1558
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:23,200
the last generation of

1559
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,880
super wealthy plutocrats the generation

1560
00:56:23,199 --> 00:56:26,078
of the gilded age of the late 19th

1561
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,519
century

1562
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,960
did a pretty good job of founding

1563
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:31,519
universities

1564
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,280
chicago wouldn't exist uh but for the

1565
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:35,679
money of that era

1566
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,280
and so my message to not only to elon

1567
00:56:35,679 --> 00:56:39,199
but to all of

1568
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,599
the peers all of those people who made

1569
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:44,000
their billions uh out of technology over

1570
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:45,440
the last couple of decades is this is

1571
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,599
your time i mean and this is your

1572
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,838
opportunity to create something new i

1573
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,240
can't really understand why

1574
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:53,920
the wealthy of our time are content to

1575
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:56,239
hand their money

1576
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,798
i mean think of the vast sums mike

1577
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:02,078
bloomberg recently gave to johns hopkins

1578
00:56:58,798 --> 00:57:03,920
to his established institutions

1579
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:05,920
when

1580
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:09,358
on close inspection those institutions

1581
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,400
don't seem to spend the money terribly

1582
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:12,798
well

1583
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:15,039
and in fact one of the mysteries of our

1584
00:57:12,798 --> 00:57:17,280
time is the lack of due diligence that

1585
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:19,519
hard-nosed billionaires seem to do when

1586
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,400
it comes to philanthropy

1587
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,079
so

1588
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,039
i think there's an opportunity here for

1589
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:27,680
this generation of very talented wealthy

1590
00:57:25,039 --> 00:57:29,358
people to to do what their their

1591
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:31,279
counterparts did in the late 90s and

1592
00:57:29,358 --> 00:57:32,798
early 20th century and and create some

1593
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:34,400
new institutions

1594
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:35,920
and they don't need to put their names

1595
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,559
on the buildings they just need to do

1596
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:40,798
what what the founders of

1597
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:42,798
of chicago university of chicago did

1598
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:45,358
create something new that will that will

1599
00:57:42,798 --> 00:57:45,358
endure

1600
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:51,200
yeah uh mit is launching a

1601
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,880
college of computing and um

1602
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:54,798
steven schwartzman has

1603
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:57,119
given quite a large sum of money i think

1604
00:57:54,798 --> 00:57:57,920
in total a billion dollars

1605
00:57:57,119 --> 00:57:59,599
and

1606
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,519
as somebody who loves computing and

1607
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,119
somebody who loves mit i want some

1608
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:07,280
accountability

1609
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:09,599
uh for mit becoming a better institution

1610
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,200
and this is once again why i'm excited

1611
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:13,359
about university of austin because it

1612
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:14,639
serves as a beacon look you can create

1613
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:16,639
something new

1614
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:18,400
and this is what the great institutions

1615
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:20,078
of the future should look like

1616
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:23,358
and steve schwartzman

1617
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:25,920
uh is also uh an innovator the idea of

1618
00:58:23,358 --> 00:58:27,039
creating a college on the tsinghua

1619
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:28,880
campus

1620
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:30,318
and creating a kind of rhodes program

1621
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:33,519
for students from the western world to

1622
00:58:30,318 --> 00:58:36,000
come study in china was was steve's idea

1623
00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:36,960
and and i was somewhat involved did some

1624
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,719
visiting

1625
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,639
professing there

1626
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,159
it taught me that you can create

1627
00:58:40,639 --> 00:58:45,279
something new

1628
00:58:42,159 --> 00:58:48,838
uh in that area of graduate education

1629
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:51,760
and quite quickly attract really strong

1630
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:53,838
applicants because the people who finish

1631
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,440
their four years at harvard or stanford

1632
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:57,679
know

1633
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,720
that they don't know a lot

1634
00:58:57,679 --> 00:59:01,279
and i

1635
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,239
having taught a lot of people

1636
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,640
in that

1637
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:06,798
group know how intellectually

1638
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:08,078
dissatisfied they often are at the end

1639
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:09,920
of four years

1640
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,318
i mean they may have beautifully gained

1641
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,480
the system to graduate sumo or magna [ __ ]

1642
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:16,798
laude but they kind of know

1643
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:18,159
they they'll confess it after a drink or

1644
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:20,559
two they know that they gained the

1645
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:22,480
system and that intellectually it wasn't

1646
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,280
the fulfilling experience they wanted

1647
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,358
and they also know that an mba from a

1648
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,680
comparable institution would not be a

1649
00:59:27,358 --> 00:59:31,920
massive intellectual step forward so i

1650
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:34,480
think what we want to say

1651
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:36,318
is here's something really novel

1652
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,318
exciting that will

1653
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:40,318
be intellectually very challenging i i

1654
00:59:38,318 --> 00:59:41,440
do think the university of austin has to

1655
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:43,920
be difficult

1656
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,079
yeah um i'd like it to feel a little bit

1657
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:47,440
like surviving navy seal training to

1658
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:49,519
come through this program because it

1659
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,240
will be intellectually demanding

1660
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:54,719
and that i think should be a magnet so

1661
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:58,239
yeah steve if you're listening uh please

1662
00:59:54,719 --> 01:00:00,000
join elon in in supporting this and and

1663
00:59:58,239 --> 01:00:02,000
and peter thiel if you're listening i

1664
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:03,440
know how skeptical you are about the

1665
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,239
idea of creating a new university

1666
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:05,440
because

1667
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:06,959
heaven knows peter and i have been

1668
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:08,318
discussing this idea for years and he's

1669
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:09,760
always said well no we thought about

1670
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:10,798
this and it just isn't going to work but

1671
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:13,040
i

1672
01:00:10,798 --> 01:00:15,440
really think we've got a we got a

1673
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:17,199
responsibility to to do this well

1674
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,440
steve's been on this podcast before

1675
01:00:17,199 --> 01:00:21,279
we've uh spoken a few times so i'll send

1676
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:23,280
this to him i hope he does actually get

1677
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:25,440
behind it as well so i'm i'm super

1678
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,440
excited by

1679
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:30,559
the ideas that we've been talking about

1680
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,400
that this uh effort represents and

1681
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:35,440
what ripple effect it has on the rest of

1682
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:37,760
society so thank you that was a time

1683
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,079
beautifully spent and i'm really

1684
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:41,680
grateful for the

1685
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,559
the fortune

1686
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,078
of

1687
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,599
getting a chance to talk to you at this

1688
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:48,160
moment in history

1689
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,838
because i've been a big fan of your work

1690
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:52,078
and the reason i wanted to talk to you

1691
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:53,920
today is

1692
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,079
about all the excellent books you've

1693
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,480
written about various aspects of history

1694
01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:01,599
through money war

1695
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,639
power pandemics all of that but i'm glad

1696
01:01:01,599 --> 01:01:04,559
that

1697
01:01:02,639 --> 01:01:06,639
this we got a chance to talk about this

1698
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,160
which is not looking at history it's

1699
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:11,199
looking at the future

1700
01:01:08,159 --> 01:01:12,078
this is a beautiful little uh fortuitous

1701
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:15,519
uh

1702
01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:18,000
moment i appreciate you talking about it

1703
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:20,079
in the book ascent of money

1704
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,760
you give a history of the world through

1705
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:23,599
the lens of money

1706
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,920
if the financial system is uh

1707
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:28,559
evolutionary nature much like life on

1708
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,639
earth what is the origin of money on

1709
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,040
earth

1710
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:35,358
the origin of money

1711
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:37,039
predates coins

1712
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,880
most people kind of assume i'll talk

1713
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,000
about coins but coins are relatively

1714
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,000
late

1715
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:44,400
developments

1716
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,639
back in ancient mesopotamia so i don't

1717
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:49,200
know 5 000 years ago

1718
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:51,279
there were

1719
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:53,279
relations between creditors and debtors

1720
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,720
there there are even in the simplest

1721
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,160
economy

1722
01:01:54,719 --> 01:01:57,838
uh because of the way in which

1723
01:01:56,159 --> 01:01:59,920
agriculture works

1724
01:01:57,838 --> 01:02:01,599
hey i need i need to

1725
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:03,519
plant these seeds but i'm not going to

1726
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,880
have crops for x months

1727
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:09,519
so we have clay tablets in which

1728
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:11,200
simple debt transactions are inscribed i

1729
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:13,679
remember looking at great numbers of

1730
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:15,598
these in the british museum when i was

1731
01:02:13,679 --> 01:02:16,558
writing the ascent of money and that's

1732
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,640
really

1733
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:21,119
the beginning of money the minute you

1734
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:22,719
start recording a relationship between a

1735
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:24,559
creditor and a debtor you have something

1736
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:27,118
that is quasi money

1737
01:02:24,559 --> 01:02:31,599
and that is probably what these um

1738
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:33,440
clay tablets mostly denoted

1739
01:02:31,599 --> 01:02:35,760
from that point on

1740
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:39,599
there's a great evolutionary experiment

1741
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,480
to see what the most convenient way is

1742
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:42,880
to

1743
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:45,838
record

1744
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,358
relations between creditors and debtors

1745
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:48,798
and

1746
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:50,078
what emerges

1747
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:53,119
uh

1748
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:54,798
in the time of the ancient greeks

1749
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:56,240
are coins metal

1750
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:58,000
tokens

1751
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:00,479
uh sometimes

1752
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,719
uh a valuable metal sometimes not

1753
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,318
usually bearing the imprint of a state

1754
01:03:02,719 --> 01:03:06,719
or a monarch

1755
01:03:04,318 --> 01:03:10,000
and that's the sort of more familiar

1756
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:12,558
form of of money that we still use today

1757
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:14,000
for very very small transactions i

1758
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:15,760
expect coins will

1759
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:18,239
all be gone by the time

1760
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,079
my youngest son is my age but but

1761
01:03:18,239 --> 01:03:22,879
they're a last remnant of a very very

1762
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:24,798
old way of of doing

1763
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,838
of doing simple transactions and when

1764
01:03:24,798 --> 01:03:30,000
you say coins you mean physical coins

1765
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:32,000
i'm talking about coins has been

1766
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:34,239
rebranded into digital space yeah not

1767
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,838
coin based coins actual coin coins you

1768
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:37,759
know the ones that jangle in your in

1769
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:39,838
your pocket and you kind of don't know

1770
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,559
quite what to do with once you have some

1771
01:03:39,838 --> 01:03:43,358
so

1772
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,880
that that became an incredibly

1773
01:03:43,358 --> 01:03:47,679
pervasive

1774
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:48,559
form of of of paying for things money's

1775
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:50,078
just a

1776
01:03:48,559 --> 01:03:51,519
it's just a crystallization of a

1777
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:53,280
relationship between a debtor and a

1778
01:03:51,519 --> 01:03:54,719
creditor and coins are just very

1779
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,640
fungible

1780
01:03:54,719 --> 01:03:58,719
you know whereas a clay tablet relates

1781
01:03:56,639 --> 01:04:00,480
to a specific transaction

1782
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:02,399
coins are generic and fungible they can

1783
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:04,960
be used in in any transaction so that

1784
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,318
was an important evolutionary advance

1785
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:07,679
if you think of financial history and

1786
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:10,400
this was the point of the ascent of

1787
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:12,399
money as an evolutionary story there are

1788
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:15,358
punctuated equilibria

1789
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:17,838
people get by with coins for a long time

1790
01:04:15,358 --> 01:04:19,038
despite their defects as a means of

1791
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:21,279
payment

1792
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:23,839
such as that they can be debased

1793
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:25,119
they can be clipped uh it's very hard to

1794
01:04:23,838 --> 01:04:27,679
avoid

1795
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:28,640
fake or debased money entering the

1796
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:31,038
system

1797
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:32,879
but coinage is still kind of the basis

1798
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:34,720
of payments all the way

1799
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,039
through the roman empire out the other

1800
01:04:34,719 --> 01:04:39,279
end into the so-called dark ages it's

1801
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:43,760
still how most things are settled

1802
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:46,240
in cash transactions in the early 1300s

1803
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:47,680
you don't get a big shift until after

1804
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:50,239
the black death

1805
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:51,759
when there is such a need to monetize

1806
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:53,439
the economy because of chronic labor

1807
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,559
shortages and feudalism begins to

1808
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,400
unravel

1809
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:59,039
that you you just don't have a

1810
01:04:56,400 --> 01:05:01,200
sufficient uh amount of coinage and so

1811
01:04:59,039 --> 01:05:03,520
you get bills of exchange and i'm really

1812
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:06,000
into bills of exchange

1813
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:07,759
because and this i hope will capture

1814
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,318
your listeners

1815
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:13,200
and viewers imaginations

1816
01:05:10,318 --> 01:05:15,440
when they start using bills of exchange

1817
01:05:13,199 --> 01:05:18,318
which which are really just pieces of

1818
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,559
paper saying you know i owe you over a

1819
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:23,759
three month period while goods are in

1820
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:25,280
transit from florence to london

1821
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:28,240
you get the first

1822
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:30,559
uh peer-to-peer payment system which is

1823
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:32,639
network verified because they're they're

1824
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:35,200
not coins they don't have a king's head

1825
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:37,118
on them they're just pieces of paper

1826
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:40,078
and the verification comes in the form

1827
01:05:37,119 --> 01:05:42,000
of signatures and you you need

1828
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,519
ultimately some kind of

1829
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,480
guarantee if

1830
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:48,159
i write an iou to you build change i

1831
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,920
mean you don't really know me that well

1832
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:52,318
we only just met so you might want to

1833
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,798
get endorsed by i don't know somebody

1834
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:57,038
really credit worthy like elon

1835
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:59,358
and so we we actually can see in the

1836
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:02,640
late 14th century in northern italy in

1837
01:05:59,358 --> 01:06:05,199
england and elsewhere the evolution of

1838
01:06:02,639 --> 01:06:06,078
a peer-to-peer network system of of

1839
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,318
payment

1840
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:11,200
and that's actually how world trade

1841
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:13,920
grows because you just couldn't settle

1842
01:06:11,199 --> 01:06:15,598
long oceanic transactions with coinage

1843
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,559
it just wasn't practical

1844
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:18,400
all those

1845
01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:20,000
treasure chests full of doubloons which

1846
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,480
were part of the way in which the

1847
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:25,199
spanish empire worked really inefficient

1848
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:27,920
so bills of exchange are an exciting uh

1849
01:06:25,199 --> 01:06:29,358
part of the story and they illustrate

1850
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:31,200
something i should have made more clear

1851
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:33,199
of the ascent of money

1852
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:36,000
that not everything used in payment

1853
01:06:33,199 --> 01:06:38,159
needs to be money

1854
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:40,159
classically economists will tell you oh

1855
01:06:38,159 --> 01:06:41,279
well money money has three different

1856
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:43,038
functions

1857
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,119
it's you've heard this a zillion times

1858
01:06:43,039 --> 01:06:46,960
right it's a unit of account it's a

1859
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:49,200
store of value and it's a medium of

1860
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,639
exchange

1861
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:52,480
now there are three

1862
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:54,798
or four things that are worth saying

1863
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:56,480
about this and i'll just say two one

1864
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:58,159
it may be that those three things are a

1865
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,838
trilemma and it's very difficult for

1866
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:02,078
anything to be all of them this point

1867
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:04,159
was made by my hoover colleague manny

1868
01:07:02,079 --> 01:07:05,599
rincon cruz last year and i still wish

1869
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:07,598
he would write this up as a paper

1870
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,880
because it's a great insight

1871
01:07:07,599 --> 01:07:10,798
the second thing that's really

1872
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:12,798
interesting to me is that

1873
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:15,759
payments don't need to be money

1874
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:17,759
and if we go around as economists love

1875
01:07:15,760 --> 01:07:18,880
to do saying well bitcoin's not money

1876
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,559
because it doesn't fulfill these

1877
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:22,240
criteria

1878
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,480
we're missing the point that you could

1879
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:26,078
build a system of payments

1880
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:28,318
which i think is how we should think

1881
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,079
about crypto that is isn't money doesn't

1882
01:07:28,318 --> 01:07:33,519
need to be money it's like bills of

1883
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:35,599
exchange it's network-based verification

1884
01:07:33,519 --> 01:07:37,920
peer-to-peer transactions without

1885
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,519
without third-party verification

1886
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,519
when it hit me the other day that we

1887
01:07:39,519 --> 01:07:43,358
actually had this precedent for crypto i

1888
01:07:41,519 --> 01:07:45,038
got quite excited and thought

1889
01:07:43,358 --> 01:07:46,480
i wish i had written that in the ascent

1890
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:48,640
of money

1891
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,920
can you sort of from a first principles

1892
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:53,838
like almost like a physics perspective

1893
01:07:51,920 --> 01:07:57,200
or maybe a human perspective

1894
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:59,519
uh describe where does the value of

1895
01:07:57,199 --> 01:08:00,798
money come from like where is it

1896
01:07:59,519 --> 01:08:03,119
actually

1897
01:08:00,798 --> 01:08:04,798
where is it so it's a sheet of paper or

1898
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:05,760
it's coins

1899
01:08:04,798 --> 01:08:08,000
but

1900
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:09,440
it feels like in a platonic sense

1901
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,838
there's some kind of thing that's

1902
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:15,119
actually storing the value as us a bunch

1903
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:17,439
of ants are dancing around and so on

1904
01:08:15,119 --> 01:08:18,640
i come from a family of physicists i'm

1905
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:21,119
the black sheep of the family my

1906
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:23,039
mother's a physicist my sister is

1907
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:25,198
and uh so when you ask me to explain

1908
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:27,278
something in physics terms i

1909
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:30,238
i get a kind of little part of me dies

1910
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:31,920
because i know i'll fail

1911
01:08:30,238 --> 01:08:35,439
but in in truth

1912
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:38,798
it doesn't really matter what we decide

1913
01:08:35,439 --> 01:08:40,079
money is going to be and anything can

1914
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:42,238
record

1915
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:45,920
uh crystallize the the relationship

1916
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:47,278
between the the creditor and the debtor

1917
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:49,440
it could be a piece of paper it can be a

1918
01:08:47,279 --> 01:08:51,679
piece of metal it can be nothing can

1919
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:52,798
just be a digital entry

1920
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:54,640
it's

1921
01:08:52,798 --> 01:08:56,640
trust that we're really

1922
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:58,159
talking about here

1923
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:00,319
we are

1924
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:02,158
not just trusting one another we may not

1925
01:09:00,319 --> 01:09:03,759
but we are trusting

1926
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,119
the money

1927
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,560
so

1928
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:10,318
whatever we use to represent

1929
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:13,039
the credited debtor relationship whether

1930
01:09:10,319 --> 01:09:14,719
it's a banknote or a coin or whatever

1931
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:18,158
it does depend on

1932
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,158
us both trusting it

1933
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:24,960
and that doesn't always pertain

1934
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:27,520
what we see in episodes of inflation

1935
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:29,920
especially episodes of hyperinflation is

1936
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,880
a crisis of trust a crisis of confidence

1937
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:32,880
in

1938
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,159
the means of payments

1939
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:38,159
and this is very traumatic for the

1940
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:40,399
societies to which it happens

1941
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:42,079
by and large human beings particularly

1942
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:44,079
once you have a rule of law

1943
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:46,479
uh system of the sort that evolved in

1944
01:09:44,079 --> 01:09:49,600
the west and then became generalized

1945
01:09:46,479 --> 01:09:50,318
are predisposed to trust one another

1946
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:52,480
and

1947
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,560
the default setting is to trust money

1948
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:58,559
even when it depreciates a quite steady

1949
01:09:54,560 --> 01:10:00,880
rate as the us dollar has done uh

1950
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,679
pretty much uninterruptedly since

1951
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,440
the 1960s

1952
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:08,000
it takes quite a big disruption for

1953
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:10,158
money to lose that trust but i think

1954
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,600
essentially what money should be thought

1955
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:14,479
of as

1956
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:18,079
is a series of tokens that can take any

1957
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:19,839
form we like and can be purely digital

1958
01:10:18,079 --> 01:10:23,119
which represent our

1959
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:24,960
transactions as as creditors and debtors

1960
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:27,519
and the whole thing depends on our

1961
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:29,520
collective trust to work

1962
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,719
i had to explain this to stephen colbert

1963
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:32,640
once in the

1964
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:35,679
call burster the old old show that was

1965
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:35,679
actually funny and

1966
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:42,239
when he said um

1967
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:44,480
so so so neil could i be money and i

1968
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,399
said yes you know we could

1969
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,559
we could settle

1970
01:10:46,399 --> 01:10:49,679
a debt with a human being that was quite

1971
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,760
common

1972
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:53,279
in much of history but but it's not the

1973
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,039
most convenient

1974
01:10:53,279 --> 01:10:57,920
form of money

1975
01:10:55,039 --> 01:10:59,519
money has to be convenient that's why

1976
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,158
when they worked out how to make

1977
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:04,239
payments with cell phones the chinese

1978
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:06,079
simply went straight there from bank

1979
01:11:04,238 --> 01:11:08,079
accounts they skipped out credit cards

1980
01:11:06,079 --> 01:11:10,800
you won't see credit cards in china

1981
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:13,198
except in the hands of naive tourists

1982
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,239
how much can this trust

1983
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:16,559
bear

1984
01:11:14,238 --> 01:11:18,079
in terms of uh us humans with our human

1985
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,920
nature testing it

1986
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:21,920
it seems that i guess the surprising

1987
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,158
thing is the thing works

1988
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,520
a bunch of self-interested ants running

1989
01:11:24,158 --> 01:11:27,359
around

1990
01:11:25,520 --> 01:11:30,320
trading in trust

1991
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:32,079
and it seems to work except for

1992
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:33,439
a bunch of moments in human history when

1993
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:34,319
there's hyperinflation like you

1994
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:35,919
mentioned

1995
01:11:34,319 --> 01:11:36,799
and it's just

1996
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:39,119
uh

1997
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:41,039
it's just kind of amazing it's kind of

1998
01:11:39,119 --> 01:11:42,719
amazing that us humans if i were to be

1999
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:44,079
optimistic and sort of hopeful about

2000
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:46,000
human nature

2001
01:11:44,079 --> 01:11:49,359
it gives me a sense that

2002
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,198
people want to lean on each other they

2003
01:11:49,359 --> 01:11:53,198
want to trust

2004
01:11:51,198 --> 01:11:56,639
that certainly

2005
01:11:53,198 --> 01:11:59,678
i would say probably now a widely shared

2006
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:02,000
view amongst evolutionary psychologists

2007
01:11:59,679 --> 01:12:04,079
network scientists it's one of

2008
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,679
uh nicholas christakis's argument in a

2009
01:12:04,079 --> 01:12:07,760
recent book

2010
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:11,039
and i think economic history broadly

2011
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:13,039
bears this out but you have to be

2012
01:12:11,039 --> 01:12:16,640
cautious

2013
01:12:13,039 --> 01:12:18,640
the cases where the system works

2014
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:20,320
are familiar to us

2015
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:23,600
because those are the

2016
01:12:20,319 --> 01:12:26,399
those are the the states and the eras

2017
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:27,920
that produce a lot of written records

2018
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:30,399
but when

2019
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,319
the system of trust collapses and the

2020
01:12:30,399 --> 01:12:34,559
monetary system collapses with it

2021
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:36,639
there's generally quite a paucity of of

2022
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:37,679
records i found that when i was

2023
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:40,159
writing

2024
01:12:37,679 --> 01:12:41,119
doom and so we slightly are biased in

2025
01:12:40,158 --> 01:12:43,599
favor

2026
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:46,960
of the periods when trust

2027
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:50,079
prevailed and the system functioned

2028
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:52,880
it's very easy to point to a great many

2029
01:12:50,079 --> 01:12:55,920
episodes of very very intense monetary

2030
01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:58,880
chaos even in the relatively recent past

2031
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:00,800
in the wake of the first world war

2032
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,640
multiple currencies not just the german

2033
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,840
currency multiple currencies were

2034
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,840
completely destroyed the russian

2035
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,719
currency the polish currency

2036
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:10,560
there were currency disasters all over

2037
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:12,399
central and eastern europe in the early

2038
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:15,600
1920s

2039
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:17,679
and that was partly because

2040
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,560
over the course of the 19th century a

2041
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:24,000
system had evolved in which trust was

2042
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:28,480
based on gold and rules that were

2043
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,920
supposedly applied by central banks

2044
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:32,158
that system

2045
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:35,279
which produced relative price stability

2046
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:37,279
over the the 19th century fell apart as

2047
01:13:35,279 --> 01:13:39,279
a result of the first world war and and

2048
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,800
as soon as it was gone as soon as there

2049
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:43,840
was no longer a

2050
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,520
clear link between those uh banknotes

2051
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:47,440
and coins and gold the whole thing went

2052
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:49,360
completely haywire

2053
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:52,079
and i think we should remember that the

2054
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:54,238
extent of the monetary chaos from

2055
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:56,479
certainly 1918

2056
01:13:54,238 --> 01:13:57,839
all the way through to the late 1940s i

2057
01:13:56,479 --> 01:14:00,079
mean the german currency was destroyed

2058
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,199
not once but twice in that period and

2059
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:03,920
that was one of the most advanced

2060
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:06,000
economies in the world

2061
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,520
in the united states

2062
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:12,880
there were periods of intensely

2063
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:14,800
deep deflation prices fell by a third in

2064
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:16,400
the great depression and then very

2065
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,119
serious price volatility in the

2066
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:22,158
immediate post-world war ii period so

2067
01:14:19,119 --> 01:14:23,279
it's a bit of an illusion maybe it's an

2068
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:25,439
illusion

2069
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:27,519
for people who've spent most of their

2070
01:14:25,439 --> 01:14:29,439
lives in the last 20 years

2071
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,280
we've had a period of exceptional price

2072
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:34,719
stability

2073
01:14:31,279 --> 01:14:35,679
since this century began

2074
01:14:34,719 --> 01:14:38,000
in which

2075
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:40,880
a regime of central bank independence

2076
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:44,238
and inflation targeting appeared to

2077
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:45,920
generate steady below 2 inflation in

2078
01:14:44,238 --> 01:14:48,238
much of the developed world was a bit

2079
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:49,520
too low for the central bankers liking

2080
01:14:48,238 --> 01:14:52,959
and that became a problem in the

2081
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:56,000
financial crisis but we've avoided major

2082
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:57,520
price uh instability for the better part

2083
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,679
of 20 years in most of the world there

2084
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,280
haven't really been that many

2085
01:14:59,679 --> 01:15:03,359
very high inflation episodes and hardly

2086
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:05,679
any hyperinflationary episodes venezuela

2087
01:15:03,359 --> 01:15:07,279
is one of the very few zimbabwes another

2088
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:09,039
but if you take a hundred year view or a

2089
01:15:07,279 --> 01:15:12,079
200 year view or if you want to take a

2090
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:14,560
500 year view you realize that

2091
01:15:12,079 --> 01:15:16,640
quite often the system doesn't work

2092
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:19,039
if you go back to the 17th century there

2093
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:20,719
were multiple competing systems of

2094
01:15:19,039 --> 01:15:23,840
coinage there had been a great inflation

2095
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:25,600
that had begun the previous century

2096
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:28,800
the price revolution caused mainly by

2097
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:29,760
the arrival of new world silver

2098
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,840
i think

2099
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:33,679
financial history is a bit messier than

2100
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,119
one might think

2101
01:15:33,679 --> 01:15:36,880
and

2102
01:15:35,119 --> 01:15:40,079
the more one studies it the more one

2103
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:41,840
realizes that the need for the evolution

2104
01:15:40,079 --> 01:15:43,519
the reason bills of exchange came along

2105
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,520
was because the coinage systems had

2106
01:15:43,520 --> 01:15:47,760
stopped working the reason that

2107
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,920
banknotes started to become used more

2108
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:51,520
generally first in the american colonies

2109
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:53,440
in the 17th century then more widely in

2110
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:55,040
the 18th century was just that they were

2111
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:57,359
more convenient than

2112
01:15:55,039 --> 01:15:59,679
any other way of of paying for things we

2113
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:01,359
had to invent the bond market in the

2114
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:03,359
18th century to cope with the problem of

2115
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:05,198
public debt which up until that point

2116
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:06,799
had been a recurrent source of

2117
01:16:05,198 --> 01:16:07,759
instability

2118
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:10,000
and then

2119
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:12,719
we invented equity finance

2120
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:14,880
because bonds were not enough

2121
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:17,119
so i would prefer to think of

2122
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:19,279
of the financial history as a series of

2123
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:20,640
crises really that are resolved by

2124
01:16:19,279 --> 01:16:22,800
innovations

2125
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:24,960
and in the most recent episode very

2126
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,719
exciting episode of financial history

2127
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,560
something called bitcoin

2128
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,719
initiated a new

2129
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,440
financial or monetary revolution in

2130
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:36,000
response i think to the growing

2131
01:16:33,439 --> 01:16:38,879
crisis of the fiat money system

2132
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:40,238
can you speak to that so

2133
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,480
what do you think

2134
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:44,238
about bitcoin what do you think it is

2135
01:16:42,479 --> 01:16:46,319
the response to what are the growing

2136
01:16:44,238 --> 01:16:49,198
problems of the fiat system

2137
01:16:46,319 --> 01:16:52,000
what is this moment in human history

2138
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:55,039
that is full of challenges that bitcoin

2139
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:58,079
and cryptocurrency is trying to overcome

2140
01:16:55,039 --> 01:17:00,560
i don't think bitcoin

2141
01:16:58,079 --> 01:17:02,800
was devised by satoshi

2142
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:05,520
whoever he was

2143
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:08,320
for fear of

2144
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:10,480
a breakdown of the fiat currencies

2145
01:17:08,319 --> 01:17:12,479
if it was it was a very far-sighted

2146
01:17:10,479 --> 01:17:14,238
enterprise because certainly in 2008

2147
01:17:12,479 --> 01:17:17,039
when the first bitcoin paper appeared it

2148
01:17:14,238 --> 01:17:19,119
wasn't very likely that a wave of

2149
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:21,279
inflation was coming if anything

2150
01:17:19,119 --> 01:17:23,679
there was more reason to fear deflation

2151
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:26,238
at that point i think

2152
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:28,719
it would be more accurate to say

2153
01:17:26,238 --> 01:17:31,119
that with the advent of the internet

2154
01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:33,119
there was a need for a means of payment

2155
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:35,119
native to the internet

2156
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:37,039
typing your credit card number into a

2157
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,000
random website it's not

2158
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:40,079
the way

2159
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,238
to pay for things on the internet

2160
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:44,319
and i'd rather think of bitcoin as the

2161
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:45,919
first iteration the first attempt to

2162
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,000
solve the problem of how do we pay for

2163
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,440
things in what we must learn to call the

2164
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:51,198
metaverse but

2165
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:52,399
let's just call it the internet for old

2166
01:17:51,198 --> 01:17:55,279
times sake

2167
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:57,119
and ever since that initial

2168
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:58,639
innovation the realization that you

2169
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:00,719
could use computing power and

2170
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:01,840
cryptography to create

2171
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:04,000
peer-to-peer payments without

2172
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:06,960
third-party verification

2173
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:09,119
a revolution has been gathering momentum

2174
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:11,760
that poses a very profound threat to the

2175
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:13,279
existing legacy system of banks and and

2176
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,039
fiat currencies

2177
01:18:13,279 --> 01:18:17,599
most money in the world today is made by

2178
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:19,920
banks not central banks banks

2179
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:21,679
that's what most money is it's entries

2180
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:22,719
in bank accounts

2181
01:18:21,679 --> 01:18:25,119
and

2182
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:27,600
what bitcoin represents is an

2183
01:18:25,119 --> 01:18:31,599
alternative mode of payment that really

2184
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:34,400
ought to render banks obsolete

2185
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:36,400
i think this financial revolution has

2186
01:18:34,399 --> 01:18:37,279
got past the point at which it can be

2187
01:18:36,399 --> 01:18:39,519
killed

2188
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:42,158
it was vulnerable in the early years

2189
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:44,480
but it now has sufficient adoption

2190
01:18:42,158 --> 01:18:47,198
and has generated sufficient additional

2191
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:48,879
layers i mean ethereum was in many ways

2192
01:18:47,198 --> 01:18:50,479
the more important innovation because

2193
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:52,640
you can build a whole

2194
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:55,039
system of of payments and ultimately

2195
01:18:52,640 --> 01:18:56,640
smart contracts on top of ether i think

2196
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:58,399
we've now reached the point that it's

2197
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,600
pretty hard to imagine it all being

2198
01:18:58,399 --> 01:19:01,439
killed

2199
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:03,120
and it's just survived an amazing thing

2200
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:04,559
which was the chinese shutting down

2201
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:06,079
mining and shutting down everything and

2202
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:10,159
still here we are

2203
01:19:06,079 --> 01:19:13,920
uh in fact crypto's thriving

2204
01:19:10,158 --> 01:19:16,879
what we don't know is how much damage

2205
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:19,760
ill-judged regulatory interventions are

2206
01:19:16,880 --> 01:19:22,079
going to do to this financial revolution

2207
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:24,880
left to its own devices i think

2208
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:26,800
decentralized finance provides

2209
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:28,239
the native

2210
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:29,679
monitoring financial system for the

2211
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:32,238
internet

2212
01:19:29,679 --> 01:19:34,480
and the more time we spend in

2213
01:19:32,238 --> 01:19:36,718
the metaverse the more use we will make

2214
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:38,479
of it the next things that will happen i

2215
01:19:36,719 --> 01:19:40,719
think will be that

2216
01:19:38,479 --> 01:19:42,959
uh tokens in game spaces like roblox

2217
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:45,119
will become fungible

2218
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:46,560
as my nine-year-old spends a lot more

2219
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:48,559
time playing on

2220
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:51,600
computer games than i ever did i can see

2221
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:53,840
the entertainment is becoming

2222
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,800
a game-driven phenomenon and in the game

2223
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:57,039
space

2224
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:59,679
you need skins for your avatar

2225
01:19:57,039 --> 01:20:02,479
the economics of the internet

2226
01:19:59,679 --> 01:20:04,719
it's evolving very fast and in parallel

2227
01:20:02,479 --> 01:20:06,638
you can see this payments revolution

2228
01:20:04,719 --> 01:20:09,679
happening i think that all

2229
01:20:06,639 --> 01:20:12,159
that all goes naturally very well and

2230
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:13,520
generates an enormous amount of wealth

2231
01:20:12,158 --> 01:20:16,238
in the process

2232
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:17,920
the the problem is

2233
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:21,279
there are people in washington with an

2234
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:25,679
overwhelming urge to intervene and and

2235
01:20:21,279 --> 01:20:27,279
disrupt this evolutionary uh process

2236
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:29,600
partly i think

2237
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:32,319
out of a muddled sense that there must

2238
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:34,719
be a lot of nefarious things going on if

2239
01:20:32,319 --> 01:20:36,479
we don't step in many more will go on

2240
01:20:34,719 --> 01:20:38,639
this i think greatly exaggerates how

2241
01:20:36,479 --> 01:20:40,000
much criminal activity is in fact going

2242
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,079
on in the space

2243
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,960
but there's also the vested interests at

2244
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:44,800
work

2245
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:46,960
it was odd to me

2246
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,079
maybe not odd perhaps it wasn't

2247
01:20:46,960 --> 01:20:49,760
surprising but the bank for

2248
01:20:48,079 --> 01:20:52,399
international settlements earlier this

2249
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:54,000
year published a report

2250
01:20:52,399 --> 01:20:56,000
uh one chapter of which said this must

2251
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:58,000
all go let's all stop

2252
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,600
it's all got to be shut down

2253
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,359
and it's got to be replaced by central

2254
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:02,880
bank digital currency

2255
01:21:01,359 --> 01:21:04,719
and martin wolf in the financial times

2256
01:21:02,880 --> 01:21:06,800
read this and said i agree with this

2257
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,639
and one suddenly realized that the the

2258
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,440
banks are clever they had they'd

2259
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:12,400
achieved the intellectual counter-attack

2260
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:14,638
uh

2261
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:16,079
with uh almost no fingerprints on the

2262
01:21:14,639 --> 01:21:17,840
weapon

2263
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:19,279
i think central bank digital currency is

2264
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,880
a terrible idea

2265
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:22,399
i can't imagine why we would want to

2266
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:24,880
copy a chinese

2267
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:26,559
model that essentially takes all

2268
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:27,760
transactions and puts them directly

2269
01:21:26,560 --> 01:21:30,080
under the surveillance of a central

2270
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:32,719
government institution but

2271
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:34,880
that suddenly is a

2272
01:21:32,719 --> 01:21:37,520
serious counterproposal

2273
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:39,760
so on the one side we have a relatively

2274
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:41,360
decentralized

2275
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,400
technologically

2276
01:21:41,359 --> 01:21:44,000
innovative

2277
01:21:42,399 --> 01:21:45,920
internet native

2278
01:21:44,000 --> 01:21:48,238
system of payments that has the

2279
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:49,600
possibility to evolve to produce a full

2280
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:51,599
set of

2281
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:54,000
of smart contracts

2282
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:55,760
reducing enormously the transaction

2283
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,439
costs that we currently encounter in the

2284
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,119
financial world because it gets rid of

2285
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:01,119
all those middlemen who take their cut

2286
01:21:59,119 --> 01:22:03,359
every time you take out a mortgage or

2287
01:22:01,119 --> 01:22:05,519
whatever it is that's one

2288
01:22:03,359 --> 01:22:07,198
alternative on the other side we have a

2289
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:09,199
highly centralized system in which

2290
01:22:07,198 --> 01:22:11,198
transactions will by default be under

2291
01:22:09,198 --> 01:22:13,439
the surveillance of the central bank

2292
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:16,479
seems like an easy choice to me but hey

2293
01:22:13,439 --> 01:22:18,638
i have this thing about personal liberty

2294
01:22:16,479 --> 01:22:22,559
so that's where we are i don't think

2295
01:22:18,639 --> 01:22:24,000
that the regulators can can kill uh

2296
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,760
web 3 i think we're supposed to call it

2297
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,158
web 3 because crypto is now an

2298
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:30,239
obsolescent term they can't kill it but

2299
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:31,039
they can definitely make it difficult

2300
01:22:30,238 --> 01:22:33,359
and

2301
01:22:31,039 --> 01:22:36,399
throw a lot of sand into the machine

2302
01:22:33,359 --> 01:22:38,719
and i think worst of all they can spoil

2303
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:40,238
the evolutionary story by

2304
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:42,399
by creating central bank digital

2305
01:22:40,238 --> 01:22:44,959
currency that i don't think we really

2306
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:46,238
need or

2307
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,319
we certainly don't need it in the

2308
01:22:46,238 --> 01:22:50,399
chinese form

2309
01:22:48,319 --> 01:22:52,719
but do you think bitcoin

2310
01:22:50,399 --> 01:22:55,439
has a strong chance to take over the

2311
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,439
world so

2312
01:22:55,679 --> 01:23:00,399
become the primary you mentioned the

2313
01:22:57,520 --> 01:23:02,960
three things that make money money

2314
01:23:00,399 --> 01:23:04,839
become the primary methodology by which

2315
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:07,039
we store wealth we

2316
01:23:04,840 --> 01:23:09,440
exchange no

2317
01:23:07,039 --> 01:23:11,760
no i think what bitcoin is

2318
01:23:09,439 --> 01:23:14,000
this was a phrase that i i got from my

2319
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,960
friend matt mclennan first eagle an

2320
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:18,399
option on digital gold so it's the gold

2321
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:20,560
of the system

2322
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:22,479
but currently it behaves like an option

2323
01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:24,719
that's why it's quite volatile because

2324
01:23:22,479 --> 01:23:26,718
we don't really know if this

2325
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:29,119
brave new world of

2326
01:23:26,719 --> 01:23:30,719
crypto is gonna work

2327
01:23:29,119 --> 01:23:33,439
but if it does work then bitcoin is the

2328
01:23:30,719 --> 01:23:34,719
gold because of the finite supply

2329
01:23:33,439 --> 01:23:37,119
what role

2330
01:23:34,719 --> 01:23:39,439
we need gold to play in the metaverse

2331
01:23:37,119 --> 01:23:41,439
isn't quite clear i love that you're

2332
01:23:39,439 --> 01:23:43,839
using the term metaverse this is great

2333
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:45,279
well i i just like the metaversity as a

2334
01:23:43,840 --> 01:23:46,800
kind of yeah

2335
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:49,679
as the antithesis of what we're trying

2336
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:51,360
to do in in austin but

2337
01:23:49,679 --> 01:23:53,039
i love it but can you imagine i'm using

2338
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:54,960
it sarcastically i come from glasgow

2339
01:23:53,039 --> 01:23:57,359
where all novel words have to be used

2340
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:59,520
sarcastically so the metaverse sarcastic

2341
01:23:57,359 --> 01:24:01,279
but see the beauty about humor and

2342
01:23:59,520 --> 01:24:03,920
sarcasm is that

2343
01:24:01,279 --> 01:24:06,238
the joke becomes reality i mean it's

2344
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:08,000
like using the word big bang to describe

2345
01:24:06,238 --> 01:24:09,279
the origins of the universe it becomes

2346
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:10,960
like that

2347
01:24:09,279 --> 01:24:12,719
it will after a while it's in the

2348
01:24:10,960 --> 01:24:16,239
textbooks yeah and nobody's laughing

2349
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:17,119
yeah well that's exactly right so sticky

2350
01:24:16,238 --> 01:24:19,359
yeah

2351
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:21,279
um i'm on the side of humor but it is a

2352
01:24:19,359 --> 01:24:23,679
it is a dangerous activity these days

2353
01:24:21,279 --> 01:24:25,279
anyway i think bitcoin is is the option

2354
01:24:23,679 --> 01:24:26,399
of digital gold

2355
01:24:25,279 --> 01:24:29,359
the

2356
01:24:26,399 --> 01:24:31,679
the role it plays is probably

2357
01:24:29,359 --> 01:24:33,759
not so much storage value right now it's

2358
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:36,319
just nicely not very correlated asset in

2359
01:24:33,760 --> 01:24:38,320
your portfolio when i updated the ascent

2360
01:24:36,319 --> 01:24:39,840
of money which was in 2018 10 years

2361
01:24:38,319 --> 01:24:43,359
after it came out

2362
01:24:39,840 --> 01:24:45,600
i wrote a new chapter in which i said

2363
01:24:43,359 --> 01:24:48,079
bitcoin which had just sold off after

2364
01:24:45,600 --> 01:24:51,120
its 2017 bubble

2365
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:52,800
will rise again through adoption

2366
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:54,000
because if every millionaire in the

2367
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,320
world

2368
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,719
has point two percent of his or her

2369
01:24:56,319 --> 01:25:00,319
wealth in bitcoin the price should be

2370
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:01,920
fifteen thousand dollars and if it's one

2371
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:03,198
percent it's seventy five thousand

2372
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,079
dollars

2373
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:05,919
and it

2374
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:07,439
might not even stay at one percent

2375
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:09,279
because i mean look at its recent

2376
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:12,238
performance if you

2377
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:13,759
if your exposure to stocks global stocks

2378
01:25:12,238 --> 01:25:16,638
had been hedged with a

2379
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:20,239
significant uh crypto holding you would

2380
01:25:16,639 --> 01:25:22,170
have aced the last few months

2381
01:25:20,238 --> 01:25:23,439
so i think the non-correlation

2382
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:25,359
[Music]

2383
01:25:23,439 --> 01:25:26,479
property is very very important in

2384
01:25:25,359 --> 01:25:28,719
driving

2385
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:30,238
adoption and the volatility also drives

2386
01:25:28,719 --> 01:25:32,960
adoption if you're a sophisticated

2387
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:36,559
investor uh so i think the adoption

2388
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:38,000
drives uh uh bitcoin up

2389
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:40,000
because it's the option of digital gold

2390
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,479
but it's also just this nicely not very

2391
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:45,600
correlated asset that you want to hold

2392
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:47,198
in in a world where the hell i mean the

2393
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,560
bank central bank is going to tighten

2394
01:25:47,198 --> 01:25:50,559
we've come through this massively

2395
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:55,520
disruptive episode of the pandemic

2396
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:57,440
public debt soared money printing sword

2397
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:59,920
you could hang around with your bonds

2398
01:25:57,439 --> 01:26:02,079
and wait for the euthanasia of the

2399
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:03,520
rontier you can hang on to your tech

2400
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:06,158
stocks and just hope there isn't a

2401
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:08,159
massive correction or dot dot dot well

2402
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:09,599
and it seems like a fairly obvious

2403
01:26:08,158 --> 01:26:11,439
strategy to make sure that you have at

2404
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:13,280
least some crypto

2405
01:26:11,439 --> 01:26:16,479
for the coming year

2406
01:26:13,279 --> 01:26:17,920
given what we likely have to face

2407
01:26:16,479 --> 01:26:20,559
i think what's really interesting is

2408
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:22,800
that on top of ethereum

2409
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:24,639
a more elaborate

2410
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:26,600
financial system is

2411
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:30,159
being built

2412
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:31,679
stable coins are the interesting

2413
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:32,799
puzzle

2414
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:35,840
for me

2415
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:38,320
because we need off-ramps

2416
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:40,159
you and i have to pay taxes in u.s

2417
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:41,359
dollars

2418
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:43,839
and

2419
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:46,079
there's no getting away from that

2420
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:49,600
the irs is going to let us hold crypto

2421
01:26:46,079 --> 01:26:51,600
as long as we pay our taxes and the only

2422
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,520
question in my mind is what's the

2423
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:55,920
optimal off-ramp

2424
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,520
to make those taxes make those tax

2425
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:59,760
payments

2426
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:02,560
probably it shouldn't be a currency

2427
01:26:59,760 --> 01:27:05,679
invented by facebook never struck me as

2428
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:09,679
the best solution to this problem

2429
01:27:05,679 --> 01:27:09,679
maybe it's some kind of fed coin

2430
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:13,760
or maybe one of the the existing

2431
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:16,639
algorithmic stable coins does the job

2432
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,079
but we clearly need some stable off-ramp

2433
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:20,159
so you don't think it's possible for the

2434
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:22,639
irs within the next decade to be

2435
01:27:20,158 --> 01:27:24,158
accepting bitcoin as tax payments

2436
01:27:22,639 --> 01:27:26,800
i doubt that

2437
01:27:24,158 --> 01:27:30,000
having dealt with the irs now since when

2438
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,600
did i first come here 2002

2439
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,198
it's hard to think of an institution

2440
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:35,039
less likely to

2441
01:27:33,198 --> 01:27:37,359
leap into the

2442
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:39,600
21st century when it comes to to

2443
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:40,559
payments no i think i think we'll we'll

2444
01:27:39,600 --> 01:27:43,120
be

2445
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,800
we'll be tolerated

2446
01:27:43,119 --> 01:27:46,719
crypto world will be tolerated as long

2447
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,000
as we pay our taxes that's the and it's

2448
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:49,119
important that we're already at that

2449
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,359
point

2450
01:27:49,119 --> 01:27:53,198
and then the next question becomes well

2451
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:55,198
does gary gensler define everything as a

2452
01:27:53,198 --> 01:27:56,158
security and do we then have to go

2453
01:27:55,198 --> 01:27:58,559
through

2454
01:27:56,158 --> 01:28:00,479
endless regulatory contortions to

2455
01:27:58,560 --> 01:28:02,239
satisfy the sec

2456
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,638
there's a whole bunch of of

2457
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:06,718
uncertainties that the administrative

2458
01:28:04,639 --> 01:28:08,239
state excels at creating because you

2459
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:09,840
know that's just how that's how the

2460
01:28:08,238 --> 01:28:12,079
administrative state works you'll do

2461
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,840
something new hmm

2462
01:28:12,079 --> 01:28:16,000
i'll decide whether that's a security

2463
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:17,920
but don't expect me to define it for you

2464
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,840
i'll decide in an arbitrary way and then

2465
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,079
you'll owe me money so all of this is

2466
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:24,239
going to be very annoying and you know

2467
01:28:22,079 --> 01:28:27,519
for people who are trying to run

2468
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:29,439
uh exchanges or uh innovate in the space

2469
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:30,960
these these regulations will be annoying

2470
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:33,759
but the problem with fintech is it's

2471
01:28:30,960 --> 01:28:36,239
it's different from tech broadly defined

2472
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:37,760
you know when tech got into e-commerce

2473
01:28:36,238 --> 01:28:40,238
with amazon when it got into social

2474
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:42,480
networking with facebook

2475
01:28:40,238 --> 01:28:44,799
there wasn't a huge regulatory jungle to

2476
01:28:42,479 --> 01:28:47,279
navigate but welcome to the world of

2477
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,199
finance which has always been

2478
01:28:47,279 --> 01:28:51,519
a jungle of regulation because the

2479
01:28:49,198 --> 01:28:53,519
regulation is is there to

2480
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:56,800
you know basically entrench the

2481
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:59,360
incumbents that's what it's for so

2482
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:01,920
it'll be a much tougher fight than the

2483
01:28:59,359 --> 01:29:04,238
fights we've we've seen over

2484
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:06,079
other aspects of the tech revolution

2485
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:08,238
because because the incumbents are are

2486
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:09,519
there and they see

2487
01:29:08,238 --> 01:29:11,039
the threat

2488
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:13,199
and in the end

2489
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:14,880
satoshi said it very explicitly it's

2490
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:16,559
peer-to-peer payment without third party

2491
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,000
verification and all the third parties

2492
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:20,480
are going wait what

2493
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:23,039
we're the third parties

2494
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:24,718
so there is a connection between power

2495
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:27,198
and money

2496
01:29:24,719 --> 01:29:30,079
you've mentioned world war one

2497
01:29:27,198 --> 01:29:32,879
from the perspective of money so

2498
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:35,600
power money war

2499
01:29:32,880 --> 01:29:37,440
authoritarian regimes

2500
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:40,560
from the perspective of money do you

2501
01:29:37,439 --> 01:29:42,079
have hope that cryptocurrency can help

2502
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:43,440
resist war

2503
01:29:42,079 --> 01:29:46,319
can help

2504
01:29:43,439 --> 01:29:48,799
resist the negative effects of

2505
01:29:46,319 --> 01:29:52,679
authoritarian regimes

2506
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:52,679
or is that a silly hope

2507
01:29:53,039 --> 01:29:56,079
wars

2508
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:58,800
happen

2509
01:29:56,079 --> 01:30:01,198
because the people

2510
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:03,760
who have the power to command armed

2511
01:30:01,198 --> 01:30:03,759
forces

2512
01:30:04,158 --> 01:30:09,039
miscalculate

2513
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:09,039
that's generally what happens

2514
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,800
and we will have a big war in the near

2515
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,639
future if

2516
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:16,960
both the chinese government and the us

2517
01:30:14,639 --> 01:30:19,520
government miscalculates

2518
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,920
and they unleash lethal lethal force on

2519
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:24,000
one another and there's nothing that any

2520
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:25,039
financial institution can do to stop

2521
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:26,719
that

2522
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:29,198
any more than the rothschilds could

2523
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:30,719
rothschilds could stop world war one

2524
01:30:29,198 --> 01:30:32,960
and they were then the biggest bank in

2525
01:30:30,719 --> 01:30:35,439
the world by far with massive

2526
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:37,840
international financial influence

2527
01:30:35,439 --> 01:30:40,960
so let's accept that war is

2528
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:40,960
is in a different domain

2529
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:44,319
war

2530
01:30:42,319 --> 01:30:46,158
would impact the financial world

2531
01:30:44,319 --> 01:30:48,799
massively if it were a war between the

2532
01:30:46,158 --> 01:30:50,719
united states and china because

2533
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:52,320
there's still a huge

2534
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:54,399
china trade on

2535
01:30:52,319 --> 01:30:56,799
wall street is long china

2536
01:30:54,399 --> 01:30:58,879
europe is long china

2537
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:00,480
so the conflict that i could foresee in

2538
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:02,719
the future is one that's highly

2539
01:31:00,479 --> 01:31:05,198
financially disruptive

2540
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:07,439
where does crypto fit in

2541
01:31:05,198 --> 01:31:09,759
crypto's obvious

2542
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:11,519
utility in the short run

2543
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:14,079
is as a store of

2544
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,280
wealth of transferable wealth for people

2545
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:16,960
who live

2546
01:31:15,279 --> 01:31:17,840
in dangerous places

2547
01:31:16,960 --> 01:31:19,760
with

2548
01:31:17,840 --> 01:31:21,279
failing not just failing money but

2549
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,039
failing rule of law

2550
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:24,880
that's why in latin america there's so

2551
01:31:23,039 --> 01:31:26,479
much interest in crypto because latin

2552
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:29,840
americans have a lot of monetary history

2553
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:32,559
to look back on and not much of it is

2554
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:34,960
so i think that the short run

2555
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:37,600
problem that crypto solves

2556
01:31:34,960 --> 01:31:39,039
is and this goes back to the the digital

2557
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:42,079
gold point

2558
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:43,600
if you are in a dangerous place with

2559
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:44,719
weak rule of law and weak property

2560
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,600
rights

2561
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:50,960
here's a new and better way

2562
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,960
to have portable wealth

2563
01:31:51,119 --> 01:31:56,000
i think the next

2564
01:31:53,520 --> 01:31:58,719
question to ask is

2565
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:02,000
would you want to be long crypto

2566
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:03,439
in the event of world war three

2567
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,880
what's interesting about that question

2568
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:08,238
is that world war three would likely

2569
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:10,000
have a significant cyber dimension to it

2570
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:11,599
and i don't want to be a hundred percent

2571
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,920
in crypto if

2572
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:16,159
they crash the internet

2573
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:18,239
which between them china and russia

2574
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:20,079
might be able to do

2575
01:32:18,238 --> 01:32:21,599
that's a fascinating question whether

2576
01:32:20,079 --> 01:32:24,238
you want to be holding

2577
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:26,800
physical gold or digital gold in the

2578
01:32:24,238 --> 01:32:28,718
event of world war iii the smart person

2579
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,320
who studied history definitely wants

2580
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:32,000
better both

2581
01:32:30,319 --> 01:32:34,319
and

2582
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:36,719
so let's imagine world war iii has a

2583
01:32:34,319 --> 01:32:39,198
very very severe cyber component to it

2584
01:32:36,719 --> 01:32:41,359
with high levels of disruption

2585
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:44,000
yeah you'd be glad of the old the old

2586
01:32:41,359 --> 01:32:45,599
shiny stuff at that point

2587
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,600
so

2588
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:51,280
diversification still seems like the

2589
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:54,159
most important truth of a financial

2590
01:32:51,279 --> 01:32:55,599
history yeah and and what is crypto it's

2591
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:58,158
just this wonderful new source of

2592
01:32:55,600 --> 01:33:01,199
diversification but you'd be nuts to be

2593
01:32:58,158 --> 01:33:03,599
a hundred percent in bitcoin i mean i i

2594
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:06,319
i have some friends who are probably

2595
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:06,960
quite close to that close to 100

2596
01:33:06,319 --> 01:33:11,759
i

2597
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:12,560
i'd marr the i'd mar the bowls of steel

2598
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:15,360
yeah

2599
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:17,679
uh in whatever way that balls of steel

2600
01:33:15,359 --> 01:33:20,079
takes uh to takes form

2601
01:33:17,679 --> 01:33:21,679
uh you mentioned smart contracts what

2602
01:33:20,079 --> 01:33:23,519
are your thoughts about

2603
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:25,520
in the context of the history of money

2604
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,520
about ethereum about smart contracts

2605
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:28,480
about kind of

2606
01:33:27,520 --> 01:33:31,520
uh

2607
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:34,799
more systematic at scale formalization

2608
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:37,679
of agreements between humans

2609
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:40,480
i think

2610
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:43,520
it must be the case

2611
01:33:40,479 --> 01:33:45,678
that a lot of the complexity in a

2612
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:46,719
mortgage

2613
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:49,039
is

2614
01:33:46,719 --> 01:33:51,279
redundant

2615
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:53,119
that when we are confronted with pages

2616
01:33:51,279 --> 01:33:54,559
and pages and pages and pages of small

2617
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:56,960
prints

2618
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:59,360
uh we're seeing some

2619
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:01,039
manifestation of of the late stage

2620
01:33:59,359 --> 01:34:04,559
regulatory state

2621
01:34:01,039 --> 01:34:06,639
the transaction itself is quite simple

2622
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:09,520
and most of the verbage is just ass

2623
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:12,239
covering by regulators

2624
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:13,360
so i think the smart contract

2625
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:15,359
although

2626
01:34:13,359 --> 01:34:17,599
i'm sure lawyers will

2627
01:34:15,359 --> 01:34:20,238
email me and tell me i'm wrong

2628
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:22,320
can deal with a lot of the plain vanilla

2629
01:34:20,238 --> 01:34:23,919
and maybe not so plain transactions that

2630
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:26,639
we want to do

2631
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:28,480
and eliminate yet more

2632
01:34:26,639 --> 01:34:30,159
intermediaries

2633
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:33,359
that's my

2634
01:34:30,158 --> 01:34:35,599
my kind of working assumption and

2635
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:37,839
given that a lot of

2636
01:34:35,600 --> 01:34:40,719
of financial transactions

2637
01:34:37,840 --> 01:34:43,440
have the potential at least to be

2638
01:34:40,719 --> 01:34:46,000
to be simplified automated

2639
01:34:43,439 --> 01:34:48,238
turned into smart contracts that that's

2640
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:51,439
probably where the future goes

2641
01:34:48,238 --> 01:34:53,599
i can't see an obvious reason why my

2642
01:34:51,439 --> 01:34:55,279
range of different financial

2643
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:56,400
needs let's think about insurance for

2644
01:34:55,279 --> 01:34:59,039
example

2645
01:34:56,399 --> 01:35:02,799
will continue to be met

2646
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:05,439
with instruments that in some ways are

2647
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:07,760
100 years old

2648
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:09,839
so i think we're still

2649
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:12,320
an early stage of a financial revolution

2650
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:15,279
that will greatly streamline

2651
01:35:12,319 --> 01:35:17,679
how we take care of all those financial

2652
01:35:15,279 --> 01:35:19,920
needs that we have uh mortgages and

2653
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,920
insurance leave leap to mind you know

2654
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:24,319
most households are

2655
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:27,118
are penalized for

2656
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:29,599
being financially poorly educated and

2657
01:35:27,118 --> 01:35:32,079
confronted with oligopolistic

2658
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,520
financial services providers so you kind

2659
01:35:32,079 --> 01:35:35,679
of leave

2660
01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:38,639
college already in debt

2661
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:41,359
so you start

2662
01:35:38,639 --> 01:35:44,079
in debt servitude and then

2663
01:35:41,359 --> 01:35:45,839
you gotta somehow leave her up to buy a

2664
01:35:44,079 --> 01:35:48,559
home if you can because everybody's kind

2665
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:51,440
of telling you you should do that so

2666
01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:54,239
so you and your spouse you are getting

2667
01:35:51,439 --> 01:35:56,719
even more leveraged and you're

2668
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:59,439
you're long one asset class called real

2669
01:35:56,719 --> 01:36:00,319
estate which is super illiquid

2670
01:35:59,439 --> 01:36:01,519
i mean

2671
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:02,319
already i'm

2672
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:04,880
i'm

2673
01:36:02,319 --> 01:36:06,960
crying inside at the thought of

2674
01:36:04,880 --> 01:36:08,400
describing so many households financial

2675
01:36:06,960 --> 01:36:10,480
predicament in that way and i'm not done

2676
01:36:08,399 --> 01:36:11,920
with them yet because oh by the way

2677
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:14,158
there's all this insurance you have to

2678
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:15,600
take out and here are the providers that

2679
01:36:14,158 --> 01:36:17,599
are willing to insure you and here are

2680
01:36:15,600 --> 01:36:19,119
the premiums you're going to be paying

2681
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:21,039
which are kind of presented to you

2682
01:36:19,118 --> 01:36:22,399
that's your that's your car insurance

2683
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:24,158
that's your home insurance and if you're

2684
01:36:22,399 --> 01:36:26,319
here it's the earthquake insurance and

2685
01:36:24,158 --> 01:36:29,039
pretty soon you're just bleeding money

2686
01:36:26,319 --> 01:36:30,079
in a bunch of monthly payments to the

2687
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:32,479
mortgage

2688
01:36:30,079 --> 01:36:34,319
lender to the insurer

2689
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:35,439
to all the other people that lent you

2690
01:36:34,319 --> 01:36:37,519
money

2691
01:36:35,439 --> 01:36:38,799
and let's look at your balance sheet it

2692
01:36:37,520 --> 01:36:40,480
sucks

2693
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:41,920
you know there's this great big chunk of

2694
01:36:40,479 --> 01:36:43,519
real estate and what else have you

2695
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:45,199
really got on there

2696
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:47,119
and the other side is a bunch of debt

2697
01:36:45,198 --> 01:36:48,238
which is probably paying too high

2698
01:36:47,118 --> 01:36:51,039
interest

2699
01:36:48,238 --> 01:36:55,039
the typical household in the median

2700
01:36:51,039 --> 01:36:56,800
kind of range is is at the mercy of

2701
01:36:55,039 --> 01:37:00,719
oligopolistic financial services

2702
01:36:56,800 --> 01:37:02,079
providers go down further in the social

2703
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:04,319
scale and people are outside the

2704
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:06,639
financial system altogether and those

2705
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:09,359
poor folks have to rely on

2706
01:37:06,639 --> 01:37:10,800
banknotes and informal lending with huge

2707
01:37:09,359 --> 01:37:12,399
punitive rates

2708
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,279
we have to do better than this this has

2709
01:37:12,399 --> 01:37:15,759
to be

2710
01:37:13,279 --> 01:37:17,599
this has to be improved upon and i think

2711
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,079
what's exciting about our time is that

2712
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:21,760
technology now exists that didn't exist

2713
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:23,118
when i wrote the ascent of money to

2714
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:26,320
solve these problems when i wrote this

2715
01:37:23,118 --> 01:37:28,000
under money which was in 2008

2716
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:30,479
you couldn't really solve

2717
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:31,600
the problem i've just described

2718
01:37:30,479 --> 01:37:33,759
certainly you couldn't solve it with

2719
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,119
something like microfinance that was

2720
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,719
obviously not

2721
01:37:35,118 --> 01:37:39,198
viable the

2722
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:41,118
interest rates were high the transaction

2723
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:42,719
costs were crazy but now we have

2724
01:37:41,118 --> 01:37:44,880
solutions and the solutions are

2725
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:47,118
extremely exciting so fintech is this

2726
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:48,719
great force for good that brings people

2727
01:37:47,118 --> 01:37:51,359
into the financial system

2728
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:53,039
and reduces transaction costs crypto is

2729
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:55,118
part of it but it's just part of it

2730
01:37:53,039 --> 01:37:56,719
there's a much broader story of fintech

2731
01:37:55,118 --> 01:37:58,639
going on here where

2732
01:37:56,719 --> 01:38:01,679
you get suddenly you get financial

2733
01:37:58,639 --> 01:38:03,760
services on your phone don't cost nearly

2734
01:38:01,679 --> 01:38:05,118
as much as they they did when there had

2735
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:08,079
to be a bricks and mortar building on

2736
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:10,479
main street that you kind of went humbly

2737
01:38:08,079 --> 01:38:12,158
and beseeched to lend you money i'm

2738
01:38:10,479 --> 01:38:14,479
excited about that because it seems to

2739
01:38:12,158 --> 01:38:15,839
me very socially transformative

2740
01:38:14,479 --> 01:38:17,519
i'll give you one other example of

2741
01:38:15,840 --> 01:38:20,639
what's great

2742
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:22,719
the people who really get sculpt in our

2743
01:38:20,639 --> 01:38:25,600
financial system are senders and

2744
01:38:22,719 --> 01:38:27,920
receivers of uh remittances

2745
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:30,560
which are often amongst the poorest

2746
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:32,319
families in the world the people who are

2747
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:34,320
like my wife's family in east africa

2748
01:38:32,319 --> 01:38:36,880
really kind of hand to mouth

2749
01:38:34,319 --> 01:38:39,198
and if you send money to east africa or

2750
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:42,560
the philippines or central america it's

2751
01:38:39,198 --> 01:38:43,439
it's the transaction costs are awful

2752
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,840
uh

2753
01:38:43,439 --> 01:38:47,839
i'm talking to you western union

2754
01:38:48,158 --> 01:38:51,599
we're gonna solve that problem

2755
01:38:50,079 --> 01:38:53,920
so ten years from now the transaction

2756
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:55,440
cost will just be negligible and the

2757
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:57,440
money will go to the people who need it

2758
01:38:55,439 --> 01:38:58,799
rather than to rent seeking financial

2759
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:01,118
institutions so i'm on the side of the

2760
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:02,639
revolution with this because i think the

2761
01:39:01,118 --> 01:39:05,759
incumbent financial institutions

2762
01:39:02,639 --> 01:39:07,279
globally are doing a pretty terrible job

2763
01:39:05,760 --> 01:39:09,280
and

2764
01:39:07,279 --> 01:39:11,039
middle class and lower class families

2765
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:13,039
lose out and

2766
01:39:11,039 --> 01:39:14,719
thankfully technology technology allows

2767
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:16,319
us to fix this yeah so fintech can

2768
01:39:14,719 --> 01:39:19,198
remove a lot of inefficiencies in the

2769
01:39:16,319 --> 01:39:21,198
system i'm super excited myself maybe as

2770
01:39:19,198 --> 01:39:22,719
a machine learning person in the data

2771
01:39:21,198 --> 01:39:24,960
oracles so

2772
01:39:22,719 --> 01:39:27,198
converting a lot of our physical world

2773
01:39:24,960 --> 01:39:29,118
into data so

2774
01:39:27,198 --> 01:39:29,839
and have smart contracts on top of that

2775
01:39:29,118 --> 01:39:32,559
so

2776
01:39:29,840 --> 01:39:35,520
that no longer is there's this fuzziness

2777
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:38,960
about what is the concrete nature of the

2778
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:42,000
agreements you can tie your agreement to

2779
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:43,760
weather you can tie your agreement to

2780
01:39:42,000 --> 01:39:46,158
the behavior of

2781
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:48,159
certain kinds of financial uh systems

2782
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:50,399
you can tie your behavior to

2783
01:39:48,158 --> 01:39:52,238
i don't know uh i mean all kinds of

2784
01:39:50,399 --> 01:39:55,839
things you can connect it to the body in

2785
01:39:52,238 --> 01:39:58,718
terms of human um sensory information

2786
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:59,920
like uh you can make an agreement that

2787
01:39:58,719 --> 01:40:03,118
if you

2788
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:04,399
don't lose five pounds in the next month

2789
01:40:03,118 --> 01:40:05,679
you're going to pay me a thousand

2790
01:40:04,399 --> 01:40:08,079
dollars or something like that i don't

2791
01:40:05,679 --> 01:40:10,158
know it's a stupid example but it's not

2792
01:40:08,079 --> 01:40:12,319
because like you can create all kinds of

2793
01:40:10,158 --> 01:40:14,399
services on top of that you can you can

2794
01:40:12,319 --> 01:40:15,599
just create all kinds of interesting

2795
01:40:14,399 --> 01:40:17,039
applications that completely

2796
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:19,600
revolutionize

2797
01:40:17,039 --> 01:40:21,519
how humans transact

2798
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:22,560
i think

2799
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:24,800
of course

2800
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:26,960
we don't want to

2801
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:29,520
create a world of

2802
01:40:26,960 --> 01:40:31,840
chinese style social credit

2803
01:40:29,520 --> 01:40:34,320
in which our behavior

2804
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:35,119
becomes so transparent

2805
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:36,799
to

2806
01:40:35,118 --> 01:40:39,039
providers of financial services

2807
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:40,239
particularly insurers that

2808
01:40:39,039 --> 01:40:42,880
uh

2809
01:40:40,238 --> 01:40:44,799
when i try to go into the pub i'm i'm

2810
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:46,159
stopped from doing so

2811
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:48,159
every time you take a drink your

2812
01:40:46,158 --> 01:40:51,519
insurance goes up

2813
01:40:48,158 --> 01:40:54,238
right or my credit card won't work uh in

2814
01:40:51,520 --> 01:40:56,080
certain restaurants because they serve

2815
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:58,000
you know ribeye steak

2816
01:40:56,079 --> 01:41:00,238
i fear that world because i see it being

2817
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:02,960
built in china and

2818
01:41:00,238 --> 01:41:04,959
we we must at all costs make sure that

2819
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:07,198
the western world has something

2820
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,279
distinctive to offer

2821
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:11,599
uh it can't just be oh it's the same as

2822
01:41:09,279 --> 01:41:16,000
in china only the data go to

2823
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:17,679
to five tech companies rather than to

2824
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:20,800
xi jinping so

2825
01:41:17,679 --> 01:41:22,960
i think the the way we need to steer

2826
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:24,560
this world is

2827
01:41:22,960 --> 01:41:25,359
in the way that

2828
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,719
our

2829
01:41:25,359 --> 01:41:27,599
data

2830
01:41:26,719 --> 01:41:30,960
are

2831
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:33,600
by default vaulted on our devices

2832
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:36,399
and we choose

2833
01:41:33,600 --> 01:41:38,079
when to release the data yes

2834
01:41:36,399 --> 01:41:40,000
rather than the default setting being

2835
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:41,519
that the data are available

2836
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,760
that's important i think because it was

2837
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:46,320
one of the biggest mistakes of

2838
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:48,400
the evolution of the internet that that

2839
01:41:46,319 --> 01:41:50,960
in a way the default was to let our our

2840
01:41:48,399 --> 01:41:53,759
data be plundered it's hard to undo that

2841
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:56,000
but i think we can we can at least uh

2842
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:59,600
create a new regime

2843
01:41:56,000 --> 01:42:00,800
that in future makes privacy default

2844
01:41:59,600 --> 01:42:03,840
rather than

2845
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,840
open access default

2846
01:42:04,079 --> 01:42:07,920
in the book doom the politics of

2847
01:42:06,479 --> 01:42:10,799
catastrophe

2848
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:13,199
your newest book you describe wars

2849
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,199
pandemics and the terrible disasters in

2850
01:42:13,198 --> 01:42:17,839
human history

2851
01:42:15,198 --> 01:42:19,599
which stands out to you as the worst in

2852
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:23,600
terms of how much

2853
01:42:19,600 --> 01:42:25,119
it shook the world and the human spirit

2854
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:27,199
i am glad

2855
01:42:25,118 --> 01:42:29,839
i was not around

2856
01:42:27,198 --> 01:42:30,799
in the mid 14th century when the bubonic

2857
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:33,760
plague

2858
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:35,679
swept across eurasia

2859
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:38,239
as far as we can see

2860
01:42:35,679 --> 01:42:40,399
that was history's worst pandemic

2861
01:42:38,238 --> 01:42:41,198
maybe there was a comparably bad one in

2862
01:42:40,399 --> 01:42:44,799
the

2863
01:42:41,198 --> 01:42:46,319
reign of the emperor uh justinian but

2864
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,679
there's some reason to think it wasn't

2865
01:42:46,319 --> 01:42:49,519
as bad

2866
01:42:47,679 --> 01:42:50,399
and the more we learn about

2867
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,760
uh

2868
01:42:50,399 --> 01:42:53,519
the 14th century with the more we

2869
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:57,840
realized that it really was across

2870
01:42:53,520 --> 01:42:59,840
eurasia and the the mortality was 30

2871
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:02,079
in some places 50

2872
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:04,480
in some places higher there were whole

2873
01:43:02,079 --> 01:43:07,359
towns that were just emptied

2874
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:09,519
and when one reads about the black death

2875
01:43:07,359 --> 01:43:10,799
it's an unimaginable

2876
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:12,320
nightmare

2877
01:43:10,800 --> 01:43:14,480
of of

2878
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:16,880
death and

2879
01:43:14,479 --> 01:43:20,399
madness in the death with flagellate

2880
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:22,639
orders wandering from town to town

2881
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:24,719
seeking to ward off divine retribution

2882
01:43:22,639 --> 01:43:26,319
by flogging themselves

2883
01:43:24,719 --> 01:43:27,920
people turning on the local jewish

2884
01:43:26,319 --> 01:43:28,799
communities as if it's somehow their

2885
01:43:27,920 --> 01:43:32,319
fault

2886
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:34,320
that must have been a nightmarish time

2887
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:36,799
if you ask me

2888
01:43:34,319 --> 01:43:37,759
for an an also ran a runner-up it would

2889
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,880
be

2890
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:42,000
it would be world war ii uh in eastern

2891
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:44,960
europe

2892
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:47,520
and in many ways

2893
01:43:44,960 --> 01:43:49,439
it might have been worse because

2894
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:51,600
for a medieval

2895
01:43:49,439 --> 01:43:54,000
peasant the sense of being on the wrong

2896
01:43:51,600 --> 01:43:56,639
side of divine retribution must have

2897
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:59,359
been overpowering

2898
01:43:56,639 --> 01:44:00,880
in the mid-20th century

2899
01:43:59,359 --> 01:44:03,118
you knew

2900
01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:06,800
that this was man-made

2901
01:44:03,118 --> 01:44:09,519
murder on a massive industrial scale

2902
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,400
if only if one reads grossman's life and

2903
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,719
fate

2904
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:14,158
just to take one example

2905
01:44:12,719 --> 01:44:16,079
one enters a

2906
01:44:14,158 --> 01:44:19,359
a hellscape

2907
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:20,399
that it's extremely hard

2908
01:44:19,359 --> 01:44:22,000
to imagine

2909
01:44:20,399 --> 01:44:23,920
oneself in

2910
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,399
so these are two of the great disasters

2911
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:28,399
of of human history and

2912
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:30,559
if we did have a time machine if one

2913
01:44:28,399 --> 01:44:31,759
really were able to transport people

2914
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:35,360
back and

2915
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:37,280
and give them a glimpse of these times

2916
01:44:35,359 --> 01:44:39,118
i think the post-traumatic stress would

2917
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:41,599
be enormous people would come back from

2918
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:43,439
those those trips even if it was a

2919
01:44:41,600 --> 01:44:48,000
one-day excursion with guaranteed

2920
01:44:43,439 --> 01:44:49,599
survival uh in a state of of utter shock

2921
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:52,000
you often explore counterfactual

2922
01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:54,320
hypothetical history this which is a

2923
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:57,039
fascinating thing to do uh sometimes to

2924
01:44:54,319 --> 01:44:58,799
a controversial degree

2925
01:44:57,039 --> 01:45:01,439
and again you walk through that fire

2926
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:04,159
gracefully

2927
01:45:01,439 --> 01:45:06,638
so let me ask maybe about uh

2928
01:45:04,158 --> 01:45:09,679
world war ii or

2929
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:12,400
in general or what key moments in

2930
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:14,800
history of the 20th century

2931
01:45:12,399 --> 01:45:16,559
do you think if something else happened

2932
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:18,639
at those moments we could have avoided

2933
01:45:16,560 --> 01:45:21,679
some of the big atrocities stalin's

2934
01:45:18,639 --> 01:45:24,560
holomore hitler's holocaust miles great

2935
01:45:21,679 --> 01:45:24,560
chinese famine

2936
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,840
the great turning point in in world

2937
01:45:27,760 --> 01:45:33,760
history

2938
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:37,440
is is august the 2nd 1914

2939
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:39,440
when the british cabinet decides

2940
01:45:37,439 --> 01:45:41,359
to intervene

2941
01:45:39,439 --> 01:45:43,519
and what would have been

2942
01:45:41,359 --> 01:45:45,920
a european war

2943
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,679
becomes a world war

2944
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,840
and with british intervention it becomes

2945
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:51,679
a massively larger and more protracted

2946
01:45:49,840 --> 01:45:53,840
conflict

2947
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:55,760
so very early in my career i became very

2948
01:45:53,840 --> 01:45:57,279
preoccupied with the deliberations on

2949
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:59,119
that day

2950
01:45:57,279 --> 01:46:01,198
uh and the

2951
01:45:59,118 --> 01:46:04,399
surprising decision that a liberal

2952
01:46:01,198 --> 01:46:06,000
cabinet took to to go to war

2953
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:07,839
which you might not have bet on that

2954
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:09,840
morning because

2955
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:12,079
there seemed to be a majority of cabinet

2956
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:14,079
members who would be disinclined and

2957
01:46:12,079 --> 01:46:16,000
only a minority including winston church

2958
01:46:14,079 --> 01:46:18,559
who wanted to go to war so that's one

2959
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:20,800
turning point i often wish i could

2960
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:22,480
get my time machine working and go back

2961
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,159
and say wait stop

2962
01:46:22,479 --> 01:46:26,879
just think about what you're going to do

2963
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:29,920
and by the way let me show you a video

2964
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:31,440
of europe in 1918 so that's one can we

2965
01:46:29,920 --> 01:46:33,840
linger on that one

2966
01:46:31,439 --> 01:46:36,399
that one

2967
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:37,760
uh a lot of people push back on you on

2968
01:46:36,399 --> 01:46:38,839
in the

2969
01:46:37,760 --> 01:46:40,400
because it's so

2970
01:46:38,840 --> 01:46:42,880
difficult

2971
01:46:40,399 --> 01:46:44,399
so the idea is if i could try to

2972
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:46,079
summarize and

2973
01:46:44,399 --> 01:46:49,279
you're the first person that made me

2974
01:46:46,079 --> 01:46:50,238
think about this very uncomfortable

2975
01:46:49,279 --> 01:46:52,079
thought

2976
01:46:50,238 --> 01:46:54,799
which is uh

2977
01:46:52,079 --> 01:46:56,800
the ideas in world war one it would be a

2978
01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:58,800
better world if britain stayed out of

2979
01:46:56,800 --> 01:47:02,639
the war

2980
01:46:58,800 --> 01:47:02,639
and germany won right

2981
01:47:03,198 --> 01:47:08,238
uh thinking now in retrospect that the

2982
01:47:06,238 --> 01:47:10,000
whole story of the 20th century thinking

2983
01:47:08,238 --> 01:47:12,559
about

2984
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:16,399
stalin's rule of 30 years thinking about

2985
01:47:12,560 --> 01:47:18,800
hitler's rise to power and

2986
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:21,198
the atrocities of the holocaust but also

2987
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:24,400
like you said on the eastern front

2988
01:47:21,198 --> 01:47:25,839
the death of tens of millions of people

2989
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:28,479
through the war

2990
01:47:25,840 --> 01:47:30,560
and also sort of the political prisoners

2991
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:32,399
and the suffering connected to communism

2992
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:33,920
connected to fascism all those kinds of

2993
01:47:32,399 --> 01:47:35,679
things

2994
01:47:33,920 --> 01:47:38,079
well that's one

2995
01:47:35,679 --> 01:47:40,399
that's one heck of an example of why

2996
01:47:38,079 --> 01:47:42,880
you're just like fearless in this

2997
01:47:40,399 --> 01:47:45,039
uh particular style of exploring

2998
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:46,800
counterfactual history so can you

2999
01:47:45,039 --> 01:47:48,960
elaborate on that

3000
01:47:46,800 --> 01:47:52,000
idea and maybe why this was such an

3001
01:47:48,960 --> 01:47:54,239
important day in human history

3002
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:56,880
this argument was central to my book the

3003
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:58,479
pity of war i i also did an essay in

3004
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,079
virtual history about this and it's

3005
01:47:58,479 --> 01:48:01,759
always amused me that

3006
01:48:00,079 --> 01:48:03,359
from around that time i began to be

3007
01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:05,360
called a conservative historian because

3008
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:07,439
it's actually a very left-wing argument

3009
01:48:05,359 --> 01:48:09,039
the people in 1914 who thought britain

3010
01:48:07,439 --> 01:48:11,519
should stay at the war were the left of

3011
01:48:09,039 --> 01:48:14,238
the labour party who split to become the

3012
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:15,119
independent labour party

3013
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:16,799
what

3014
01:48:15,118 --> 01:48:18,399
would have happened well first of all

3015
01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:20,400
britain was not ready for

3016
01:48:18,399 --> 01:48:22,960
war in 1914 there had not been

3017
01:48:20,399 --> 01:48:25,439
conscription the army was tiny

3018
01:48:22,960 --> 01:48:27,198
so britain had failed to deter germany

3019
01:48:25,439 --> 01:48:28,319
the germans took the decision that they

3020
01:48:27,198 --> 01:48:30,879
could risk

3021
01:48:28,319 --> 01:48:32,479
uh going through belgium

3022
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:34,400
using the schlieffen plan to fight their

3023
01:48:32,479 --> 01:48:36,479
two-front war

3024
01:48:34,399 --> 01:48:38,559
they they calculated that britain's

3025
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:40,959
intervention would either not happen or

3026
01:48:38,560 --> 01:48:42,560
not matter

3027
01:48:40,960 --> 01:48:44,840
if britain had

3028
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:48,000
been strategically

3029
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:49,199
committed to preventing germany winning

3030
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:51,279
a war in europe they should have

3031
01:48:49,198 --> 01:48:52,319
introduced conscription 10 years before

3032
01:48:51,279 --> 01:48:53,920
had a

3033
01:48:52,319 --> 01:48:55,599
meaningful land army and that would have

3034
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:57,359
deterred the germans

3035
01:48:55,600 --> 01:48:59,360
so the liberal government

3036
01:48:57,359 --> 01:49:01,759
provided the worst of both worlds a

3037
01:48:59,359 --> 01:49:03,198
commitment that was more or less secret

3038
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:05,360
to intervene

3039
01:49:03,198 --> 01:49:06,799
that the public didn't know about in

3040
01:49:05,359 --> 01:49:09,439
fact much of the liberal party didn't

3041
01:49:06,800 --> 01:49:11,360
know about but without really the means

3042
01:49:09,439 --> 01:49:14,158
to make that intervention effective a

3043
01:49:11,359 --> 01:49:16,079
tiny army with just a few divisions

3044
01:49:14,158 --> 01:49:18,638
so it's perfectly reasonable to argue as

3045
01:49:16,079 --> 01:49:20,719
a number of people did in uh on august

3046
01:49:18,639 --> 01:49:22,400
the 2nd 1914 that britain should not

3047
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:23,760
intervene after britain had not

3048
01:49:22,399 --> 01:49:26,000
immediately intervened against the

3049
01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:29,280
french revolutionary armies back in the

3050
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:30,639
1790s it had played an offshore role

3051
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:32,719
ultimately intervening but not

3052
01:49:30,639 --> 01:49:35,118
immediately intervening

3053
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:37,039
if britain had stayed out

3054
01:49:35,118 --> 01:49:40,158
i don't think that france would have

3055
01:49:37,039 --> 01:49:42,679
collapsed immediately as it had in 1870

3056
01:49:40,158 --> 01:49:44,960
the french held up remarkably well to

3057
01:49:42,679 --> 01:49:45,920
catastrophic casualties in the first six

3058
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:47,599
months of

3059
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:51,039
the first world war

3060
01:49:47,599 --> 01:49:52,639
but by 1916 i don't see how uh

3061
01:49:51,039 --> 01:49:54,639
france could have kept going if britain

3062
01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:56,159
had not joined the war

3063
01:49:54,639 --> 01:49:59,118
and i think the war would have been over

3064
01:49:56,158 --> 01:50:00,638
perhaps at some point in 1916.

3065
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:02,960
we know that germany's aims would have

3066
01:50:00,639 --> 01:50:04,480
been significantly limited because they

3067
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:06,000
would have needed to keep britain out if

3068
01:50:04,479 --> 01:50:07,598
they'd succeeded in keeping britain out

3069
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:08,719
they'd have had to keep britain out and

3070
01:50:07,599 --> 01:50:11,279
the way to keep britain out was

3071
01:50:08,719 --> 01:50:13,920
obviously not to make any annexation of

3072
01:50:11,279 --> 01:50:15,439
belgium to limit german war aims

3073
01:50:13,920 --> 01:50:17,440
particularly to limit them to eastern

3074
01:50:15,439 --> 01:50:19,039
europe and from britain's point of view

3075
01:50:17,439 --> 01:50:21,759
what was not to like

3076
01:50:19,039 --> 01:50:24,479
so the russian empire is defeated along

3077
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:26,079
with france

3078
01:50:24,479 --> 01:50:27,359
what does that really

3079
01:50:26,079 --> 01:50:29,679
change

3080
01:50:27,359 --> 01:50:30,399
if the germans are sensible

3081
01:50:29,679 --> 01:50:32,880
and

3082
01:50:30,399 --> 01:50:33,679
we can see what this might have looked

3083
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,760
like

3084
01:50:33,679 --> 01:50:38,319
they focus on eastern europe

3085
01:50:35,760 --> 01:50:39,520
they take chunks of the russian empire

3086
01:50:38,319 --> 01:50:41,679
perhaps they

3087
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:44,400
create as they did in the

3088
01:50:41,679 --> 01:50:46,960
uh in the piece of brest-litovsk an

3089
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:48,559
independent or quasi-independent poland

3090
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:51,679
in no way does that pose a threat to the

3091
01:50:48,560 --> 01:50:53,599
british empire in fact it's a good thing

3092
01:50:51,679 --> 01:50:54,800
uh britain never had had a particularly

3093
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:57,039
good relationship with the russian

3094
01:50:54,800 --> 01:50:59,279
empire after all

3095
01:50:57,039 --> 01:51:03,039
the key point here is that the germany

3096
01:50:59,279 --> 01:51:05,198
that emerges from victory in 1916

3097
01:51:03,039 --> 01:51:06,479
has a kind of european union it's the

3098
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:10,158
dominant part

3099
01:51:06,479 --> 01:51:12,718
of an enlarged germany with a

3100
01:51:10,158 --> 01:51:14,079
significant missile europa

3101
01:51:12,719 --> 01:51:16,079
whatever you want to call it customs

3102
01:51:14,079 --> 01:51:18,079
union type arrangement with

3103
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:21,840
neighboring countries

3104
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:21,840
including one suspects austria-hungary

3105
01:51:22,158 --> 01:51:27,519
that is a very different world

3106
01:51:25,198 --> 01:51:30,319
from the world of 1917-18 the

3107
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:31,840
protraction of the war for a further two

3108
01:51:30,319 --> 01:51:34,000
years

3109
01:51:31,840 --> 01:51:36,719
its globalization which britain's

3110
01:51:34,000 --> 01:51:39,039
intervention made inevitable

3111
01:51:36,719 --> 01:51:41,679
as philip zeliko showed in his recent

3112
01:51:39,039 --> 01:51:43,359
book on the failure to make peace in

3113
01:51:41,679 --> 01:51:45,199
1916

3114
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:47,679
woodrow wilson tried and failed to

3115
01:51:45,198 --> 01:51:50,638
intervene and broker a piece in 1916 so

3116
01:51:47,679 --> 01:51:52,719
i'm not the only counterfactualist here

3117
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:55,039
the extension of the war for a further

3118
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:57,679
two years with escalating slaughter the

3119
01:51:55,039 --> 01:52:00,399
death toll rose because the industrial

3120
01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:02,800
uh capacity of the armies grew greater

3121
01:52:00,399 --> 01:52:04,238
that's what condemns us to the bolshevik

3122
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:06,880
revolution

3123
01:52:04,238 --> 01:52:08,799
and it's what condemns us ultimately

3124
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:10,960
to nazism

3125
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:13,840
because it's out of

3126
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,760
the experience of defeat in 1918 as

3127
01:52:13,840 --> 01:52:17,679
hitler makes clear in mind camp that he

3128
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:20,960
becomes radicalized and enters the

3129
01:52:17,679 --> 01:52:20,960
political realm

3130
01:52:21,439 --> 01:52:26,238
take out those additional years of war

3131
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:28,800
and hitler's just a failed artist it's

3132
01:52:26,238 --> 01:52:29,678
the it's the end of the war

3133
01:52:28,800 --> 01:52:31,360
that

3134
01:52:29,679 --> 01:52:33,679
turns him into

3135
01:52:31,359 --> 01:52:34,960
the demagogue

3136
01:52:33,679 --> 01:52:38,719
you asked what are the things that

3137
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:40,319
evolve avoid the totalitarian states

3138
01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:41,840
as i've said british

3139
01:52:40,319 --> 01:52:44,559
intervention for me is the most

3140
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:46,639
plausible and it takes out all of that

3141
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:48,800
malignant history that follows from the

3142
01:52:46,639 --> 01:52:51,118
bolshevik revolution it's very hard for

3143
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:53,679
me to see how lenin gets anywhere if the

3144
01:52:51,118 --> 01:52:56,158
war is over

3145
01:52:53,679 --> 01:52:56,960
that looks like the opportunity for

3146
01:52:56,158 --> 01:52:58,638
the

3147
01:52:56,960 --> 01:53:01,039
the constitutional

3148
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:02,400
elements uh the liberal elements in in

3149
01:53:01,039 --> 01:53:04,560
russia

3150
01:53:02,399 --> 01:53:08,960
there are other moments at which you can

3151
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:08,960
imagine history taking a different path

3152
01:53:09,198 --> 01:53:10,960
if

3153
01:53:10,158 --> 01:53:12,559
uh

3154
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:15,198
the provisional government in russia had

3155
01:53:12,560 --> 01:53:16,719
been more ruthless

3156
01:53:15,198 --> 01:53:18,638
it was very lenient towards the

3157
01:53:16,719 --> 01:53:20,000
bolsheviks but if it had just rounded

3158
01:53:18,639 --> 01:53:22,319
them up and shot the bolshevik

3159
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:24,880
leadership that would have certainly

3160
01:53:22,319 --> 01:53:26,960
cut the bolshevik revolution off

3161
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:29,279
one looks back on the

3162
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:31,679
conduct of the the russian liberals with

3163
01:53:29,279 --> 01:53:33,920
the kind of despair at their their

3164
01:53:31,679 --> 01:53:35,679
failure to see the scale of the threat

3165
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:38,399
that they face and the ruthlessness that

3166
01:53:35,679 --> 01:53:40,079
the bolshevik leadership would evince

3167
01:53:38,399 --> 01:53:42,000
there's a counterfactual in germany

3168
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:44,238
which is interesting

3169
01:53:42,000 --> 01:53:47,840
i think the weimar republic destroyed

3170
01:53:44,238 --> 01:53:48,959
itself in two disastrous economic

3171
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:50,719
uh

3172
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:52,560
calamities the inflation and then the

3173
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:54,639
deflation

3174
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:56,880
it's difficult for me to imagine hitler

3175
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:59,118
getting to be

3176
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:02,239
reich chancellor without those huge

3177
01:53:59,118 --> 01:54:04,960
economic disasters so another part of my

3178
01:54:02,238 --> 01:54:07,759
early work explored alternative policy

3179
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:11,039
options that the german republic the

3180
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:13,280
weimar republic might have pursued

3181
01:54:11,039 --> 01:54:16,158
there are other contingencies that that

3182
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:18,880
spring to mind in 1936 or 38 i think

3183
01:54:16,158 --> 01:54:21,039
more plausibly 38

3184
01:54:18,880 --> 01:54:24,639
britain should have gone to war

3185
01:54:21,039 --> 01:54:26,719
the great mistake was munich

3186
01:54:24,639 --> 01:54:28,880
hitler was in an extremely vulnerable

3187
01:54:26,719 --> 01:54:30,800
position in 1938

3188
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:33,760
because remember he didn't have russia

3189
01:54:30,800 --> 01:54:36,239
squared away as he would in 1939.

3190
01:54:33,760 --> 01:54:38,079
chamberlain's mistake was to fold

3191
01:54:36,238 --> 01:54:40,000
instead of uh

3192
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:42,399
of going for going for war as church or

3193
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:44,479
rightly saw and and that there was a

3194
01:54:42,399 --> 01:54:46,158
magical opportunity there that would

3195
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:48,319
have played into the hands of the german

3196
01:54:46,158 --> 01:54:50,559
military opposition and conservatives to

3197
01:54:48,319 --> 01:54:52,799
to snuff hitler out

3198
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:54,800
over czechoslovakia

3199
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:59,119
i could go on the point is that the

3200
01:54:54,800 --> 01:55:01,679
history is not some inexorable narrative

3201
01:54:59,118 --> 01:55:03,598
which can only end one way it's a garden

3202
01:55:01,679 --> 01:55:05,359
of forking paths

3203
01:55:03,599 --> 01:55:06,800
and at

3204
01:55:05,359 --> 01:55:08,960
many many

3205
01:55:06,800 --> 01:55:10,639
junctions in the road

3206
01:55:08,960 --> 01:55:12,560
there were choices

3207
01:55:10,639 --> 01:55:14,400
that could have averted the

3208
01:55:12,560 --> 01:55:16,400
calamities of the mid-20th century i

3209
01:55:14,399 --> 01:55:18,319
have to ask you about this moment

3210
01:55:16,399 --> 01:55:21,039
before you said i could go on this

3211
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:22,559
moment of chamberlain and hitler snuff

3212
01:55:21,039 --> 01:55:25,198
hitler out

3213
01:55:22,560 --> 01:55:28,320
in terms of czechoslovakia

3214
01:55:25,198 --> 01:55:30,158
and uh we'll return to the book doom on

3215
01:55:28,319 --> 01:55:35,039
this point what does it take to be a

3216
01:55:30,158 --> 01:55:38,638
great leader in the room with hitler or

3217
01:55:35,039 --> 01:55:40,960
in the same time and space as hitler

3218
01:55:38,639 --> 01:55:42,560
to snuff him out to make the right

3219
01:55:40,960 --> 01:55:45,279
decisions

3220
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:48,080
what what is so it sounds like you put

3221
01:55:45,279 --> 01:55:51,118
quite a bit of the blame on the man

3222
01:55:48,079 --> 01:55:53,599
chamberlain and give credit

3223
01:55:51,118 --> 01:55:55,439
to somebody like a churchill so what is

3224
01:55:53,599 --> 01:55:56,560
the difference where's that line you've

3225
01:55:55,439 --> 01:55:58,719
also

3226
01:55:56,560 --> 01:56:00,719
uh written a book about henry kissinger

3227
01:55:58,719 --> 01:56:02,719
who's an interesting sort of

3228
01:56:00,719 --> 01:56:04,719
person that's been through

3229
01:56:02,719 --> 01:56:06,800
throughout many difficult decisions in

3230
01:56:04,719 --> 01:56:08,639
the games of power so what does it take

3231
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:10,560
to be a great leader in that moment that

3232
01:56:08,639 --> 01:56:12,800
particular moment sorry to keep talking

3233
01:56:10,560 --> 01:56:15,920
is fascinating to me because it feels

3234
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:18,880
like it's man on man conversations that

3235
01:56:15,920 --> 01:56:20,639
define history well hitler was bluffing

3236
01:56:18,880 --> 01:56:23,359
uh he really wasn't ready for war in

3237
01:56:20,639 --> 01:56:25,599
1938 the german economy was clearly not

3238
01:56:23,359 --> 01:56:26,559
ready for war in 1938

3239
01:56:25,599 --> 01:56:29,119
and

3240
01:56:26,560 --> 01:56:31,679
and chamberlain made a fundamental

3241
01:56:29,118 --> 01:56:33,039
uh miscalculation along with his

3242
01:56:31,679 --> 01:56:34,480
advisors because it wasn't all

3243
01:56:33,039 --> 01:56:35,840
chamberlain he was

3244
01:56:34,479 --> 01:56:37,279
in many ways

3245
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:40,000
articulating

3246
01:56:37,279 --> 01:56:41,279
the establishment view uh and i tried to

3247
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:42,719
show in a book called war of the world

3248
01:56:41,279 --> 01:56:45,198
how that establishment worked it

3249
01:56:42,719 --> 01:56:47,118
extended uh through the bbc into the

3250
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:48,719
aristocracy to oxford there was an

3251
01:56:47,118 --> 01:56:51,039
establishment view chamberlain

3252
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:52,399
personified it churchill was seen as a

3253
01:56:51,039 --> 01:56:54,479
warmonger

3254
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:57,118
uh he was at his lowest point of

3255
01:56:54,479 --> 01:56:59,118
popularity in 1938 but what is what is

3256
01:56:57,118 --> 01:57:00,719
it that chamberlain gets wrong because

3257
01:56:59,118 --> 01:57:02,319
it's conceptual

3258
01:57:00,719 --> 01:57:04,239
chamberlain is persuaded that britain

3259
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:06,719
has to play for time because britain is

3260
01:57:04,238 --> 01:57:09,039
not ready for war in 1938.

3261
01:57:06,719 --> 01:57:11,679
he fails to see that the time that he

3262
01:57:09,039 --> 01:57:13,359
gets that he buys at munich is also

3263
01:57:11,679 --> 01:57:15,599
available to hitler

3264
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:17,118
everybody gets the time and hitler's

3265
01:57:15,599 --> 01:57:18,880
able to do much more with it because

3266
01:57:17,118 --> 01:57:20,719
hitler strikes the pact with

3267
01:57:18,880 --> 01:57:22,319
with stalin

3268
01:57:20,719 --> 01:57:23,840
that guarantees

3269
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:25,759
that germany can fight a war on one

3270
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:27,279
front in 1939.

3271
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:28,639
what does chamberlain do builds some

3272
01:57:27,279 --> 01:57:30,719
more aircraft

3273
01:57:28,639 --> 01:57:32,880
so the great mistake of the strategy of

3274
01:57:30,719 --> 01:57:34,480
appeasement was to play for time i mean

3275
01:57:32,880 --> 01:57:36,960
they knew all was coming but they were

3276
01:57:34,479 --> 01:57:39,039
playing for time not realizing that

3277
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:41,920
hitler got the time too

3278
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:43,840
and after he partitioned czechoslovakia

3279
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:46,000
he was in a much stronger position not

3280
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:48,480
least because of all the resources that

3281
01:57:46,000 --> 01:57:50,719
they were able to plunder uh

3282
01:57:48,479 --> 01:57:52,718
uh from czechoslovakia

3283
01:57:50,719 --> 01:57:54,079
so that was the conceptual mistake

3284
01:57:52,719 --> 01:57:55,039
churchill

3285
01:57:54,079 --> 01:57:58,238
played

3286
01:57:55,039 --> 01:58:00,880
an heroic role in pointing out

3287
01:57:58,238 --> 01:58:03,919
this mistake and predicting accurately

3288
01:58:00,880 --> 01:58:05,520
that it would lead to war on worse terms

3289
01:58:03,920 --> 01:58:09,599
what does it take

3290
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:12,480
it takes a distinct courage

3291
01:58:09,599 --> 01:58:14,000
to be unpopular and churchill was deeply

3292
01:58:12,479 --> 01:58:16,638
unpopular at that point people would

3293
01:58:14,000 --> 01:58:20,560
listen to him in the house of commons in

3294
01:58:16,639 --> 01:58:22,880
silence on one occasion uh lady astor

3295
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:24,080
shouted rubbish

3296
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:26,400
so he went through a period of being

3297
01:58:24,079 --> 01:58:28,158
hated on

3298
01:58:26,399 --> 01:58:29,920
the other thing that made churchill a

3299
01:58:28,158 --> 01:58:32,638
formidable leader was that he always

3300
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:35,520
applied history to the problem

3301
01:58:32,639 --> 01:58:37,760
and that's why he gets it right he he

3302
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:41,119
sees the historical problem much more

3303
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:44,239
clearly than than chamberlain so i think

3304
01:58:41,118 --> 01:58:45,920
if you go back to 1938

3305
01:58:44,238 --> 01:58:47,919
there's no realistic counterfactual in

3306
01:58:45,920 --> 01:58:49,840
which churchill's in government in 1938

3307
01:58:47,920 --> 01:58:51,760
you have to france collapse for

3308
01:58:49,840 --> 01:58:54,239
churchill to come into government

3309
01:58:51,760 --> 01:58:55,199
but you can certainly imagine

3310
01:58:54,238 --> 01:58:57,198
a

3311
01:58:55,198 --> 01:58:59,519
tory elite

3312
01:58:57,198 --> 01:59:02,960
that's thinking more clearly

3313
01:58:59,520 --> 01:59:04,639
about the likely dynamics they haven't

3314
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:06,719
seen this

3315
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:08,800
i guess problem of conjecture to take a

3316
01:59:06,719 --> 01:59:11,439
phrase from kissinger

3317
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:13,039
which is that whatever they're doing

3318
01:59:11,439 --> 01:59:14,839
in postponing

3319
01:59:13,039 --> 01:59:17,599
the war has the

3320
01:59:14,840 --> 01:59:20,000
potential to create a worse starting

3321
01:59:17,599 --> 01:59:22,079
point for the war

3322
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,840
it would have been risky in 1938 but it

3323
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:27,118
was a way better situation than they

3324
01:59:23,840 --> 01:59:28,319
ended up with in 1939 a year later

3325
01:59:27,118 --> 01:59:31,679
you asked about kissinger and i've

3326
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:34,000
learnt a lot from reading kissinger and

3327
01:59:31,679 --> 01:59:36,399
talking to kissinger since i embarked on

3328
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,000
writing his biography a great many years

3329
01:59:36,399 --> 01:59:39,598
ago

3330
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:40,960
i think one of the most important things

3331
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:41,920
i've learned

3332
01:59:40,960 --> 01:59:43,359
uh

3333
01:59:41,920 --> 01:59:46,000
is that

3334
01:59:43,359 --> 01:59:48,559
you can apply history to contemporary

3335
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,319
problems it may be the most important

3336
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:52,639
tool that we have in

3337
01:59:50,319 --> 01:59:54,079
that kind of decision making

3338
01:59:52,639 --> 01:59:55,039
you have to do it

3339
01:59:54,079 --> 01:59:56,840
quite

3340
01:59:55,039 --> 01:59:58,560
ruthlessly and

3341
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:01,360
rigorously

3342
01:59:58,560 --> 02:00:03,360
and in the moment of crisis

3343
02:00:01,359 --> 02:00:05,359
you have to take risk

3344
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:08,238
so

3345
02:00:05,359 --> 02:00:10,158
kissinger often says in his early work

3346
02:00:08,238 --> 02:00:12,959
the temptation of the bureaucrat is to

3347
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:14,000
wait for more data but ultimately the

3348
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:16,000
decision

3349
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:18,319
making that we do under uncertainty

3350
02:00:16,000 --> 02:00:20,079
can't be based on data

3351
02:00:18,319 --> 02:00:22,238
the problem of conjecture is that you

3352
02:00:20,079 --> 02:00:24,639
could take an action now

3353
02:00:22,238 --> 02:00:27,198
and incur some cost

3354
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:28,719
an avert disaster

3355
02:00:27,198 --> 02:00:30,158
but you'll get no thanks for it because

3356
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:31,840
nobody is grateful for an averted

3357
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:33,759
disaster

3358
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:38,000
and nobody goes around saying wasn't it

3359
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:38,000
wonderful how we didn't have another 911

3360
02:00:38,079 --> 02:00:42,800
on the other hand you can do nothing

3361
02:00:40,639 --> 02:00:43,920
incur no upfront costs and hope for the

3362
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:45,360
best

3363
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,440
and you might get lucky the disaster

3364
02:00:45,359 --> 02:00:50,479
might not happen

3365
02:00:47,439 --> 02:00:51,839
that's in a democratic system the much

3366
02:00:50,479 --> 02:00:54,158
easier

3367
02:00:51,840 --> 02:00:55,679
path to take

3368
02:00:54,158 --> 02:00:58,000
and i think

3369
02:00:55,679 --> 02:00:59,440
the the essence of leadership is to be

3370
02:00:58,000 --> 02:01:01,359
ready

3371
02:00:59,439 --> 02:01:02,879
to take that upfront cost avert the

3372
02:01:01,359 --> 02:01:05,279
disaster and accept that you won't get

3373
02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:06,880
gratitude

3374
02:01:05,279 --> 02:01:10,319
if i may make a

3375
02:01:06,880 --> 02:01:14,319
comment an aside about henry kissinger

3376
02:01:10,319 --> 02:01:15,920
so he i think at 98 years old currently

3377
02:01:14,319 --> 02:01:17,599
has still got it

3378
02:01:15,920 --> 02:01:19,679
yeah he's brilliant

3379
02:01:17,599 --> 02:01:22,319
it's very very impressive i

3380
02:01:19,679 --> 02:01:24,639
can only hope that my brain has the same

3381
02:01:22,319 --> 02:01:26,319
durability that his his does because

3382
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:27,520
it's a formidable intellect and it's

3383
02:01:26,319 --> 02:01:30,238
still in

3384
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:33,040
in as sharp form as it it was 50 years

3385
02:01:30,238 --> 02:01:35,359
ago so you mentioned eric schmidt's in

3386
02:01:33,039 --> 02:01:37,920
his book they reached out to me didn't

3387
02:01:35,359 --> 02:01:40,319
want to do this podcast

3388
02:01:37,920 --> 02:01:42,319
and i'm i'm i know eric schmidt i've

3389
02:01:40,319 --> 02:01:44,000
spoken to him before i like him a lot

3390
02:01:42,319 --> 02:01:46,079
obviously um

3391
02:01:44,000 --> 02:01:48,079
so they said

3392
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:48,840
we could do a podcast for 40 minutes

3393
02:01:48,079 --> 02:01:51,519
with

3394
02:01:48,840 --> 02:01:52,560
eric 40 minutes with eric and henry

3395
02:01:51,520 --> 02:01:55,520
together

3396
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:57,920
and 40 minutes with henry so those are

3397
02:01:55,520 --> 02:02:00,080
three different conversations

3398
02:01:57,920 --> 02:02:02,319
and i had to like i had to do some soul

3399
02:02:00,079 --> 02:02:03,920
searching because i said fine 40 minutes

3400
02:02:02,319 --> 02:02:04,799
with eric we'll probably talk many times

3401
02:02:03,920 --> 02:02:07,039
again

3402
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:09,119
fine let's talk about this ai book

3403
02:02:07,039 --> 02:02:11,279
together for 40 minutes

3404
02:02:09,118 --> 02:02:13,920
but i said what i wrote to them said i

3405
02:02:11,279 --> 02:02:16,479
would hate myself if i only have 40

3406
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:18,399
minutes to talk to henry kissinger

3407
02:02:16,479 --> 02:02:20,238
as i had to hold my ground went back and

3408
02:02:18,399 --> 02:02:22,319
forth and in the end decided to part

3409
02:02:20,238 --> 02:02:24,479
ways over this and i sometimes think

3410
02:02:22,319 --> 02:02:27,198
about this kind of

3411
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:30,559
difficult decision

3412
02:02:27,198 --> 02:02:31,598
um in the podcasting space

3413
02:02:30,560 --> 02:02:34,800
of

3414
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:36,319
when do you walk away

3415
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:38,800
because um

3416
02:02:36,319 --> 02:02:40,639
there's a particular world leader

3417
02:02:38,800 --> 02:02:42,560
that i've mentioned in the past where

3418
02:02:40,639 --> 02:02:43,920
the conversation is very likely to

3419
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:45,440
happen

3420
02:02:43,920 --> 02:02:47,920
and

3421
02:02:45,439 --> 02:02:50,319
as as it happens

3422
02:02:47,920 --> 02:02:52,158
those conversations can often be

3423
02:02:50,319 --> 02:02:54,079
you know unfortunately this person only

3424
02:02:52,158 --> 02:02:56,158
has 30 minutes now i know we agreed for

3425
02:02:54,079 --> 02:02:58,719
three hours but unfortunately and you

3426
02:02:56,158 --> 02:02:59,598
have to decide do i stand my ground on

3427
02:02:58,719 --> 02:03:01,760
this

3428
02:02:59,599 --> 02:03:04,000
on this point i suppose that's the thing

3429
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:07,039
that journalists have to think about

3430
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:07,039
right like um

3431
02:03:08,238 --> 02:03:12,079
do i hold on to my integrity in whatever

3432
02:03:10,319 --> 02:03:13,519
form that takes and do i stay in my

3433
02:03:12,079 --> 02:03:16,319
ground even if i

3434
02:03:13,520 --> 02:03:17,840
lose a fascinating opportunity anyway

3435
02:03:16,319 --> 02:03:18,639
it's something i thought i thought about

3436
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,319
and

3437
02:03:18,639 --> 02:03:22,719
something i think about and with henry

3438
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:24,639
kissinger i mean

3439
02:03:22,719 --> 02:03:26,239
he's had a million amazing conversations

3440
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:27,840
in your biography so it's not like

3441
02:03:26,238 --> 02:03:29,598
something is lost but it was still

3442
02:03:27,840 --> 02:03:31,840
nevertheless to me some soul searching

3443
02:03:29,599 --> 02:03:34,000
they had to do as a as a kind of

3444
02:03:31,840 --> 02:03:35,360
practice for

3445
02:03:34,000 --> 02:03:36,719
what to me is a higher stakes

3446
02:03:35,359 --> 02:03:40,000
conversation

3447
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:41,679
i'll just mention is vladimir putin

3448
02:03:40,000 --> 02:03:44,319
i can have a conversation with him

3449
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:46,560
unlike any conversation he's ever had

3450
02:03:44,319 --> 02:03:47,679
partially because i'm a fluent russian

3451
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:49,199
speaker

3452
02:03:47,679 --> 02:03:50,800
partially because i'm messed up in the

3453
02:03:49,198 --> 02:03:53,039
head in certain kind of ways that make

3454
02:03:50,800 --> 02:03:57,039
for an interesting dynamic because we're

3455
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:57,039
both judo people we both are

3456
02:03:57,279 --> 02:04:00,319
certain kinds of human beings that can

3457
02:03:58,639 --> 02:04:01,920
have a much deeper apolitical

3458
02:04:00,319 --> 02:04:04,238
conversation

3459
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:05,840
i have to ask to stay on the topic of

3460
02:04:04,238 --> 02:04:08,238
leadership

3461
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:10,800
you've uh in your book doom

3462
02:04:08,238 --> 02:04:13,279
have talked about wars pandemics

3463
02:04:10,800 --> 02:04:14,719
throughout human history

3464
02:04:13,279 --> 02:04:17,679
and

3465
02:04:14,719 --> 02:04:20,158
in some sense saying that all of these

3466
02:04:17,679 --> 02:04:22,800
disasters are man-made

3467
02:04:20,158 --> 02:04:24,399
so humans have a role in terms of the

3468
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:27,520
magnitude of the effect that they have

3469
02:04:24,399 --> 02:04:27,519
on human civilization

3470
02:04:27,679 --> 02:04:33,199
without taking cheap political shots can

3471
02:04:30,238 --> 02:04:34,559
we talk about covid19

3472
02:04:33,198 --> 02:04:37,919
how will

3473
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:40,079
history remember the coven 19 pandemic

3474
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:41,520
what were the successes with what were

3475
02:04:40,078 --> 02:04:43,279
the failures

3476
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:46,880
of leadership

3477
02:04:43,279 --> 02:04:48,960
of of man of humans

3478
02:04:46,880 --> 02:04:50,319
doom was a book

3479
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:52,800
that i was

3480
02:04:50,319 --> 02:04:55,599
planning to write before yes the

3481
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:57,920
pandemic struck as a history of

3482
02:04:55,599 --> 02:04:59,520
of the future based in large measure on

3483
02:04:57,920 --> 02:05:02,239
science fiction

3484
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:03,920
it had occurred to me in 2019 that i had

3485
02:05:02,238 --> 02:05:07,198
spent too long not reading science

3486
02:05:03,920 --> 02:05:08,960
fiction and so i decided i would

3487
02:05:07,198 --> 02:05:10,879
liven up my

3488
02:05:08,960 --> 02:05:12,800
my intake

3489
02:05:10,880 --> 02:05:14,880
by getting off history for a bit and

3490
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:16,159
reading science fiction

3491
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,400
because history is great at telling you

3492
02:05:16,158 --> 02:05:20,719
about the perennial problems of power

3493
02:05:18,399 --> 02:05:22,479
putin is always interesting on history

3494
02:05:20,719 --> 02:05:25,599
he's become something of a historian

3495
02:05:22,479 --> 02:05:27,198
recently with uh his essays and lectures

3496
02:05:25,599 --> 02:05:28,960
but what history is bad at telling you

3497
02:05:27,198 --> 02:05:31,519
is well what will the effects of this

3498
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:32,880
discontinuity of technology be

3499
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:34,480
and so i thought i need some science

3500
02:05:32,880 --> 02:05:37,359
fiction to think more about this because

3501
02:05:34,479 --> 02:05:38,879
i'm i'm i'm tending to miss

3502
02:05:37,359 --> 02:05:41,279
the importance of technological

3503
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:43,279
discontinuity

3504
02:05:41,279 --> 02:05:46,319
if you read a lot of science fiction you

3505
02:05:43,279 --> 02:05:48,238
read a lot of plague books because

3506
02:05:46,319 --> 02:05:50,719
science fiction writers are really quite

3507
02:05:48,238 --> 02:05:52,479
fond of the plague scenario so the world

3508
02:05:50,719 --> 02:05:54,000
ends in many ways in science fiction but

3509
02:05:52,479 --> 02:05:55,759
one of the most popular is the lethal

3510
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:57,359
pandemic so when

3511
02:05:55,760 --> 02:05:59,039
when the first

3512
02:05:57,359 --> 02:06:00,719
email came to me i think it was on

3513
02:05:59,039 --> 02:06:03,679
january the third from my medical friend

3514
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:05,920
justin stebing funny pneumonia and wuhan

3515
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:08,800
my antennae began

3516
02:06:05,920 --> 02:06:10,239
to tingle because it was just like

3517
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:13,520
one of those science fiction books that

3518
02:06:10,238 --> 02:06:13,519
begins in just that way

3519
02:06:14,479 --> 02:06:19,678
in a pandemic

3520
02:06:17,679 --> 02:06:22,960
as larry brilliant the epidemiologist

3521
02:06:19,679 --> 02:06:25,279
said many years ago the key

3522
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:26,639
is early detection and early action

3523
02:06:25,279 --> 02:06:28,559
that's how you deal with a novel

3524
02:06:26,639 --> 02:06:31,760
pathogen

3525
02:06:28,560 --> 02:06:33,360
and almost no western country did that

3526
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:35,280
we know it was doable because the time

3527
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:37,519
and ease and the south koreans did it

3528
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:40,000
and they did it very well

3529
02:06:37,520 --> 02:06:41,440
but really no western country got this

3530
02:06:40,000 --> 02:06:43,439
right

3531
02:06:41,439 --> 02:06:45,678
some were unlucky because super spreader

3532
02:06:43,439 --> 02:06:47,519
events happened earlier than in other

3533
02:06:45,679 --> 02:06:49,599
countries italy was hit very hard very

3534
02:06:47,520 --> 02:06:51,840
early for other countries the real

3535
02:06:49,599 --> 02:06:54,480
disaster came quite late russia which

3536
02:06:51,840 --> 02:06:57,199
has only relatively recently had a

3537
02:06:54,479 --> 02:06:59,839
really bad experience

3538
02:06:57,198 --> 02:07:02,000
the lesson for me is quite different

3539
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,760
from the one that most journalists

3540
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,238
thought they were learning last year

3541
02:07:03,760 --> 02:07:08,480
most journalists last year thought

3542
02:07:06,238 --> 02:07:10,559
trump is a terrible president he's

3543
02:07:08,479 --> 02:07:12,479
saying a lot of crazy things

3544
02:07:10,560 --> 02:07:14,960
it's his fault that we have high excess

3545
02:07:12,479 --> 02:07:16,959
mortality in the united states

3546
02:07:14,960 --> 02:07:18,880
the same argument was being made by

3547
02:07:16,960 --> 02:07:22,158
journalists in britain boris johnson dot

3548
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:24,400
dot dot brazil bolsonaro dot dot dot

3549
02:07:22,158 --> 02:07:26,799
even india narendra modi

3550
02:07:24,399 --> 02:07:29,439
the same argument

3551
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:30,560
and i think this argument is wrong in a

3552
02:07:29,439 --> 02:07:33,198
few ways

3553
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:35,039
it's true that the populist leaders said

3554
02:07:33,198 --> 02:07:37,439
many crazy things

3555
02:07:35,039 --> 02:07:38,479
and broadly speaking gave poor guidance

3556
02:07:37,439 --> 02:07:40,559
to their

3557
02:07:38,479 --> 02:07:43,439
their populations

3558
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:44,719
but i don't think it's true to say

3559
02:07:43,439 --> 02:07:46,479
that with different leaders these

3560
02:07:44,719 --> 02:07:48,560
countries would have done significantly

3561
02:07:46,479 --> 02:07:49,598
better if joe biden had magically been

3562
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:51,280
president

3563
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:52,880
a year earlier i don't think the us

3564
02:07:51,279 --> 02:07:55,279
would have done much better because the

3565
02:07:52,880 --> 02:07:57,199
things that caused excess mortality last

3566
02:07:55,279 --> 02:07:58,078
year weren't presidential decisions they

3567
02:07:57,198 --> 02:08:00,799
were

3568
02:07:58,078 --> 02:08:02,880
utter failure of cdc to provide testing

3569
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:04,560
that definitely wasn't trump's fault

3570
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:06,880
scott gottlieb's book makes that very

3571
02:08:04,560 --> 02:08:09,039
clear it's just been published recently

3572
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:11,199
we utterly failed to use technology for

3573
02:08:09,039 --> 02:08:12,479
contact tracing which the koreans did

3574
02:08:11,198 --> 02:08:15,279
very well

3575
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:17,678
we didn't really quarantine anybody

3576
02:08:15,279 --> 02:08:18,960
seriously there was no enforcement of

3577
02:08:17,679 --> 02:08:21,039
quarantine

3578
02:08:18,960 --> 02:08:22,880
and we exposed the elderly to the virus

3579
02:08:21,039 --> 02:08:24,238
as quickly as possible in elderly care

3580
02:08:22,880 --> 02:08:25,760
homes and

3581
02:08:24,238 --> 02:08:28,000
these things have very little to do with

3582
02:08:25,760 --> 02:08:29,360
presidential incompetence

3583
02:08:28,000 --> 02:08:30,960
so i think

3584
02:08:29,359 --> 02:08:33,759
leadership

3585
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:35,279
is of somewhat marginal importance in a

3586
02:08:33,760 --> 02:08:37,119
crisis like this because what you really

3587
02:08:35,279 --> 02:08:39,279
need is your public health bureaucracy

3588
02:08:37,118 --> 02:08:42,158
to get it right and very few western

3589
02:08:39,279 --> 02:08:44,479
public health bureaucracies got it right

3590
02:08:42,158 --> 02:08:46,960
could the president have given

3591
02:08:44,479 --> 02:08:50,559
better leadership yes

3592
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:52,639
his correct strategy however was

3593
02:08:50,560 --> 02:08:55,039
to learn from barack obama's playbook

3594
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:57,359
with the opioid epidemic

3595
02:08:55,039 --> 02:09:00,238
the opioid epidemic killed as many

3596
02:08:57,359 --> 02:09:01,679
people on obama's watch as covert did on

3597
02:09:00,238 --> 02:09:03,439
trump's watch

3598
02:09:01,679 --> 02:09:05,920
and it was worse in the sense because it

3599
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:07,198
only happened in the u.s and each year

3600
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:09,118
it killed more people than the year

3601
02:09:07,198 --> 02:09:10,719
before over eight years

3602
02:09:09,118 --> 02:09:13,279
nobody to my knowledge has ever

3603
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:14,719
seriously blamed obama for the opioid

3604
02:09:13,279 --> 02:09:16,800
epidemic

3605
02:09:14,719 --> 02:09:18,960
trump's mistake was to put himself front

3606
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:21,360
and center of the response to claim that

3607
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:23,439
he had some unique insight into the

3608
02:09:21,359 --> 02:09:25,198
pandemic and to say

3609
02:09:23,439 --> 02:09:27,359
with every passing week more and more

3610
02:09:25,198 --> 02:09:29,198
foolish things until even

3611
02:09:27,359 --> 02:09:31,519
a significant portion of people who'd

3612
02:09:29,198 --> 02:09:32,879
voted for him in 2016 realized that he'd

3613
02:09:31,520 --> 02:09:34,000
blown it which is why he lost the

3614
02:09:32,880 --> 02:09:36,078
election

3615
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,760
the correct strategy was actually to

3616
02:09:36,078 --> 02:09:39,759
make mike pence

3617
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:40,800
the pandemic tsar and get the hell out

3618
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:42,400
the way

3619
02:09:40,800 --> 02:09:44,400
that's what my advice to trump would

3620
02:09:42,399 --> 02:09:45,519
have been in fact it was in february of

3621
02:09:44,399 --> 02:09:47,359
last year

3622
02:09:45,520 --> 02:09:49,760
so the mistake was

3623
02:09:47,359 --> 02:09:51,198
to to try to lead

3624
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:52,880
but actually

3625
02:09:51,198 --> 02:09:54,799
leadership in a pandemic's almost a

3626
02:09:52,880 --> 02:09:56,719
contradiction in terms what you really

3627
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:59,440
need is your public health bureaucracy

3628
02:09:56,719 --> 02:10:01,118
not to [ __ ] it up and they really really

3629
02:09:59,439 --> 02:10:03,359
[ __ ] it up and that was then all

3630
02:10:01,118 --> 02:10:05,279
blamed on trump yes you know jim fallows

3631
02:10:03,359 --> 02:10:06,880
writes a piece in the atlantic that says

3632
02:10:05,279 --> 02:10:09,439
well being the president's like flying a

3633
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:10,800
light aircraft it's pilot error and i i

3634
02:10:09,439 --> 02:10:12,559
read that piece and i thought does he

3635
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:14,239
really after all the years he's spent

3636
02:10:12,560 --> 02:10:16,960
writing think that being president is

3637
02:10:14,238 --> 02:10:18,638
like flying a light aircraft i mean

3638
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:20,480
it's really nothing like flying a light

3639
02:10:18,639 --> 02:10:22,800
aircraft being president is you sit on

3640
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:24,959
top of a vast bureaucracy with how many

3641
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:25,840
different agencies 60 70 we've all lost

3642
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:27,679
count

3643
02:10:25,840 --> 02:10:29,760
and you're surrounded by advisers at

3644
02:10:27,679 --> 02:10:31,199
least a quarter of whom are saying this

3645
02:10:29,760 --> 02:10:33,360
is a disaster we have to close the

3646
02:10:31,198 --> 02:10:34,719
borders and the others are saying no no

3647
02:10:33,359 --> 02:10:36,960
we have to keep the economy going that's

3648
02:10:34,719 --> 02:10:39,279
what you're running on in november

3649
02:10:36,960 --> 02:10:41,520
so being a president in a pandemic is a

3650
02:10:39,279 --> 02:10:44,000
very unenviable position

3651
02:10:41,520 --> 02:10:46,079
uh because you actually can't

3652
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:47,520
you can't really determine whether your

3653
02:10:46,078 --> 02:10:49,519
public health bureaucracy will get it

3654
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:51,679
right or not you don't think to push

3655
02:10:49,520 --> 02:10:54,159
back on that just like being churchill

3656
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:54,960
in a war is difficult

3657
02:10:54,158 --> 02:10:57,439
so

3658
02:10:54,960 --> 02:11:00,078
leaving trump abiding aside what i would

3659
02:10:57,439 --> 02:11:04,319
love to see from a president is somebody

3660
02:11:00,078 --> 02:11:06,399
who makes great speeches and arouses the

3661
02:11:04,319 --> 02:11:08,639
public to push the bureaucracy the

3662
02:11:06,399 --> 02:11:10,879
public health bureaucracy to get their

3663
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:12,960
[ __ ] together to fire certain kinds of

3664
02:11:10,880 --> 02:11:15,440
people to do i mean i'm sorry but i'm a

3665
02:11:12,960 --> 02:11:17,439
big fan of powerful speeches especially

3666
02:11:15,439 --> 02:11:20,559
in the modern age with the internet it

3667
02:11:17,439 --> 02:11:23,118
can really move people instead

3668
02:11:20,560 --> 02:11:26,560
the lack of speeches

3669
02:11:23,118 --> 02:11:27,439
resulted in certain kinds of forces

3670
02:11:26,560 --> 02:11:30,239
uh

3671
02:11:27,439 --> 02:11:32,479
amplifying division over whether wear

3672
02:11:30,238 --> 02:11:34,319
masks or not or all

3673
02:11:32,479 --> 02:11:36,319
it's like it's almost like the public

3674
02:11:34,319 --> 02:11:38,559
pick some random topic over which to

3675
02:11:36,319 --> 02:11:40,639
divide themselves and there was like a

3676
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:41,440
complete indecision which is really what

3677
02:11:40,639 --> 02:11:42,400
it was

3678
02:11:41,439 --> 02:11:44,719
fear

3679
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:46,638
of the of uncertainty materializing

3680
02:11:44,719 --> 02:11:49,039
itself in some kind of division and then

3681
02:11:46,639 --> 02:11:51,520
you almost like busy yourself with the

3682
02:11:49,039 --> 02:11:54,158
red versus blue politics as opposed to

3683
02:11:51,520 --> 02:11:56,159
some i don't know fdr type character

3684
02:11:54,158 --> 02:11:57,598
just stands and say

3685
02:11:56,158 --> 02:11:59,279
uh

3686
02:11:57,599 --> 02:12:01,440
[ __ ] all this [ __ ] that we're

3687
02:11:59,279 --> 02:12:03,679
hearing we're going to manufacture 5

3688
02:12:01,439 --> 02:12:05,678
billion tests this is what america is

3689
02:12:03,679 --> 02:12:07,840
great at we're going to build the

3690
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:08,639
greatest testing infrastructure ever

3691
02:12:07,840 --> 02:12:09,440
built

3692
02:12:08,639 --> 02:12:11,679
or

3693
02:12:09,439 --> 02:12:13,439
something or even with the vaccine

3694
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:16,078
development but that was what i was

3695
02:12:13,439 --> 02:12:18,399
about to interject yes in a pandemic the

3696
02:12:16,078 --> 02:12:20,000
most important thing is the vaccine if

3697
02:12:18,399 --> 02:12:21,839
you get that right then you should be

3698
02:12:20,000 --> 02:12:23,359
forgiven for much else and that was the

3699
02:12:21,840 --> 02:12:25,039
one thing the trump administration got

3700
02:12:23,359 --> 02:12:27,598
right because

3701
02:12:25,039 --> 02:12:30,158
uh they went around the bureaucracy with

3702
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:33,199
operation warp speed and achieved a

3703
02:12:30,158 --> 02:12:36,799
really major success

3704
02:12:33,198 --> 02:12:37,678
so i think the paradox of of

3705
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:39,520
the

3706
02:12:37,679 --> 02:12:41,679
the 2020

3707
02:12:39,520 --> 02:12:43,199
story in the united states is that the

3708
02:12:41,679 --> 02:12:45,520
one thing that mattered most the trump

3709
02:12:43,198 --> 02:12:47,839
administration got right

3710
02:12:45,520 --> 02:12:49,760
and it got so much else wrong that was

3711
02:12:47,840 --> 02:12:52,159
sort of marginal that we were left with

3712
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:53,760
the impression that trump had

3713
02:12:52,158 --> 02:12:56,319
been to blame for the whole disaster

3714
02:12:53,760 --> 02:12:57,760
which wasn't really quite right

3715
02:12:56,319 --> 02:13:00,000
sure it would have been great if we did

3716
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:01,440
operation warp speed for testing

3717
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:04,800
but ultimately vaccines are more

3718
02:13:01,439 --> 02:13:07,039
important than tests and

3719
02:13:04,800 --> 02:13:09,920
this brings me to the question that that

3720
02:13:07,039 --> 02:13:11,599
you raised there of polarization and why

3721
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:13,520
that happened

3722
02:13:11,599 --> 02:13:15,520
now in a book called the square in the

3723
02:13:13,520 --> 02:13:18,159
tower i argued that it would be very

3724
02:13:15,520 --> 02:13:20,079
costly for the united states to allow

3725
02:13:18,158 --> 02:13:21,839
the public sphere to continue to be

3726
02:13:20,078 --> 02:13:23,279
dominated by a handful of big tech

3727
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:24,000
companies that this ultimately would

3728
02:13:23,279 --> 02:13:26,078
have

3729
02:13:24,000 --> 02:13:28,960
more adverse effects than simply

3730
02:13:26,078 --> 02:13:31,920
contested elections and i think we saw

3731
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:34,560
over the past 18 months uh just how bad

3732
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:37,118
this could be because

3733
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:39,199
the odd thing about this

3734
02:13:37,118 --> 02:13:42,158
country is that we came up with vaccines

3735
02:13:39,198 --> 02:13:44,559
with 90 plus percent efficacy

3736
02:13:42,158 --> 02:13:47,198
and about 20 of people refuse to get

3737
02:13:44,560 --> 02:13:50,079
them and still do refuse

3738
02:13:47,198 --> 02:13:52,238
for reasons that seem

3739
02:13:50,078 --> 02:13:54,238
best explained

3740
02:13:52,238 --> 02:13:56,238
in terms of the anti-vaxx network which

3741
02:13:54,238 --> 02:13:58,479
has been embedded on the internet for a

3742
02:13:56,238 --> 02:14:00,799
long time predating the pandemic

3743
02:13:58,479 --> 02:14:02,319
reni diresta wrote about this

3744
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:04,239
pre-2020

3745
02:14:02,319 --> 02:14:06,319
and this this anti-vax network has

3746
02:14:04,238 --> 02:14:08,078
turned out to kill maybe 200 000

3747
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:10,238
americans who could have been vaccinated

3748
02:14:08,078 --> 02:14:12,960
but were persuaded through magical

3749
02:14:10,238 --> 02:14:15,118
thinking that the vaccine was riskier

3750
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:16,960
than the virus whereas

3751
02:14:15,118 --> 02:14:18,399
you don't need to be in epidemiology you

3752
02:14:16,960 --> 02:14:20,480
don't need to be a medical scientist to

3753
02:14:18,399 --> 02:14:23,839
know that the virus is about two orders

3754
02:14:20,479 --> 02:14:25,359
of magnitude riskier than the vaccine

3755
02:14:23,840 --> 02:14:27,119
so again

3756
02:14:25,359 --> 02:14:29,839
leadership

3757
02:14:27,118 --> 02:14:33,439
could definitely have been better

3758
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:36,239
but the politicization of everything

3759
02:14:33,439 --> 02:14:38,719
was not trump's doing alone it

3760
02:14:36,238 --> 02:14:41,678
happened because our public sphere has

3761
02:14:38,719 --> 02:14:43,840
been dominated by a handful of platforms

3762
02:14:41,679 --> 02:14:46,000
whose business model

3763
02:14:43,840 --> 02:14:48,239
inherently promotes polarization

3764
02:14:46,000 --> 02:14:49,679
inherently promotes fake news and

3765
02:14:48,238 --> 02:14:51,519
extreme views because those are the

3766
02:14:49,679 --> 02:14:53,440
things that get the eyeballs on the

3767
02:14:51,520 --> 02:14:54,960
screens and sell the ads i mean this is

3768
02:14:53,439 --> 02:14:57,359
now a common place

3769
02:14:54,960 --> 02:14:59,840
but when one thinks about the cost of

3770
02:14:57,359 --> 02:15:02,399
allowing this uh

3771
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:04,000
kind of thing to happen it's now a very

3772
02:15:02,399 --> 02:15:06,879
high human cost

3773
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:08,880
and we were foolish to leave uncorrected

3774
02:15:06,880 --> 02:15:10,960
these structural problems in the public

3775
02:15:08,880 --> 02:15:15,199
sphere that were already very clearly

3776
02:15:10,960 --> 02:15:16,560
visible in 2016. and he described that

3777
02:15:15,198 --> 02:15:18,638
like you mentioned that there's these

3778
02:15:16,560 --> 02:15:20,000
networks they're almost like laying

3779
02:15:18,639 --> 02:15:21,279
dormant

3780
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:23,439
waiting

3781
02:15:21,279 --> 02:15:25,759
for their time in the sun and they

3782
02:15:23,439 --> 02:15:28,960
stepped forward in this case and that

3783
02:15:25,760 --> 02:15:32,480
those network effects just

3784
02:15:28,960 --> 02:15:34,880
the service catalyst for whatever

3785
02:15:32,479 --> 02:15:36,399
the bad parts of human nature i do hope

3786
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:38,239
that there's kinds of networks that

3787
02:15:36,399 --> 02:15:40,960
emphasize the the better angels of our

3788
02:15:38,238 --> 02:15:41,839
nature to to to quote steven pinker it's

3789
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:44,239
just

3790
02:15:41,840 --> 02:15:45,599
clearly and we know this from all the

3791
02:15:44,238 --> 02:15:48,000
revelations of the facebook

3792
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:49,599
whistleblower there is clearly a very

3793
02:15:48,000 --> 02:15:52,158
clear tension

3794
02:15:49,599 --> 02:15:54,078
between the business model of a company

3795
02:15:52,158 --> 02:15:56,158
like facebook

3796
02:15:54,078 --> 02:15:57,519
and the public good

3797
02:15:56,158 --> 02:15:58,879
and they know that

3798
02:15:57,520 --> 02:16:00,320
i just talked to the founder of

3799
02:15:58,880 --> 02:16:01,840
instagram i i

3800
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:03,679
yes that's

3801
02:16:01,840 --> 02:16:05,920
the case but it's not

3802
02:16:03,679 --> 02:16:07,760
from a technology perspective

3803
02:16:05,920 --> 02:16:09,279
like absolutely true of any kind of

3804
02:16:07,760 --> 02:16:11,440
social network i think it's possible to

3805
02:16:09,279 --> 02:16:13,840
build actually i think it's not just

3806
02:16:11,439 --> 02:16:15,678
possible i think it's pretty easy if you

3807
02:16:13,840 --> 02:16:16,800
set that as the goal to build social

3808
02:16:15,679 --> 02:16:17,599
networks

3809
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:20,560
that

3810
02:16:17,599 --> 02:16:21,520
don't have these negative effects

3811
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:26,000
right

3812
02:16:21,520 --> 02:16:28,719
but if the business model is we sell ads

3813
02:16:26,000 --> 02:16:31,198
and the way you sell ads is to maximize

3814
02:16:28,719 --> 02:16:32,960
user engagement then the algorithm is

3815
02:16:31,198 --> 02:16:34,478
biased in favor of fake news and extreme

3816
02:16:32,959 --> 02:16:37,199
views but it's not it's so it's not the

3817
02:16:34,478 --> 02:16:38,638
ads a lot of people blame the ads

3818
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:40,240
uh the

3819
02:16:38,638 --> 02:16:41,839
the problem i think is the engagement

3820
02:16:40,239 --> 02:16:44,000
and the engagement is just the easiest

3821
02:16:41,840 --> 02:16:46,159
the dumbest way to solve the ads i think

3822
02:16:44,000 --> 02:16:48,638
there's much different metrics that

3823
02:16:46,159 --> 02:16:51,119
could be used to make a lot more money

3824
02:16:48,638 --> 02:16:52,638
than the engagement in the long term it

3825
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:54,559
has more to do with planning for the

3826
02:16:52,638 --> 02:16:57,438
long term so

3827
02:16:54,558 --> 02:17:01,039
optimizing the selling of ads

3828
02:16:57,439 --> 02:17:02,398
to make people happy with themselves in

3829
02:17:01,040 --> 02:17:05,679
the long term

3830
02:17:02,398 --> 02:17:08,638
as opposed to some kind of addicted like

3831
02:17:05,679 --> 02:17:10,079
dopamine feeling and so that's to me

3832
02:17:08,638 --> 02:17:12,079
that has to do with metrics and

3833
02:17:10,079 --> 02:17:14,079
measuring things correctly and sort of

3834
02:17:12,079 --> 02:17:16,558
also creating a culture with what's

3835
02:17:14,079 --> 02:17:18,398
valued to have difficult conversation

3836
02:17:16,558 --> 02:17:20,718
about what we're doing with society all

3837
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:22,159
those kinds of things and i i think once

3838
02:17:20,718 --> 02:17:23,839
you have those conversations this takes

3839
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:24,638
us back to the university of austin kind

3840
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:26,239
of

3841
02:17:24,638 --> 02:17:27,759
once you have those difficult human

3842
02:17:26,239 --> 02:17:30,000
conversations you can design the

3843
02:17:27,760 --> 02:17:31,120
technology that will actually make

3844
02:17:30,000 --> 02:17:33,519
for

3845
02:17:31,120 --> 02:17:35,200
help people grow become the best version

3846
02:17:33,519 --> 02:17:36,880
of themselves help them be happy in the

3847
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:37,920
long term

3848
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:39,920
what

3849
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:41,679
gives you hope

3850
02:17:39,920 --> 02:17:43,519
about the future

3851
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:45,840
as somebody who studied some of the

3852
02:17:43,519 --> 02:17:48,559
darker moments of human history what

3853
02:17:45,840 --> 02:17:48,558
gives you hope

3854
02:17:49,040 --> 02:17:51,840
a couple of things

3855
02:17:52,478 --> 02:17:56,478
first of all

3856
02:17:54,558 --> 02:17:59,840
the united states

3857
02:17:56,478 --> 02:18:01,679
has a very unique operating system

3858
02:17:59,840 --> 02:18:03,200
which was very well designed by the

3859
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:06,558
founders who thought a lot about history

3860
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:09,280
and and realized it would take quite a

3861
02:18:06,558 --> 02:18:10,879
a novel design to prevent the republic

3862
02:18:09,280 --> 02:18:12,800
going the way of all republics because

3863
02:18:10,879 --> 02:18:14,799
republics tend to end up as tyrannies

3864
02:18:12,799 --> 02:18:16,799
for reasons that were well established

3865
02:18:14,799 --> 02:18:18,638
by the time of the renaissance

3866
02:18:16,799 --> 02:18:20,558
and it gives me hope that this design

3867
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:22,799
has worked very well

3868
02:18:20,558 --> 02:18:24,718
and with student enormous stress test

3869
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:26,398
stress test in the last

3870
02:18:24,718 --> 02:18:28,799
in the last year i became an american in

3871
02:18:26,398 --> 02:18:30,398
2018

3872
02:18:28,799 --> 02:18:33,119
i think

3873
02:18:30,398 --> 02:18:35,119
one of the most important features of

3874
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:38,719
this operating system is

3875
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:40,559
that it is the magnet for talent

3876
02:18:38,718 --> 02:18:41,919
here we sit

3877
02:18:40,558 --> 02:18:45,599
uh

3878
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:48,638
part of the immigration story

3879
02:18:45,599 --> 02:18:52,079
in uh you know in a darkened room

3880
02:18:48,638 --> 02:18:54,799
with funny accents talking to russians

3881
02:18:52,079 --> 02:18:57,039
walk into a recording studio and talk

3882
02:18:54,799 --> 02:18:57,840
about america it's it's very much like a

3883
02:18:57,040 --> 02:18:59,760
joke

3884
02:18:57,840 --> 02:19:01,760
and elon's a south african and so on and

3885
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:04,000
thiel is a german and we're

3886
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:07,040
we're extraordinarily fortunate that the

3887
02:19:04,000 --> 02:19:09,599
natives let us come and play

3888
02:19:07,040 --> 02:19:11,840
and and play in a way that we could not

3889
02:19:09,599 --> 02:19:13,439
in our countries of birth

3890
02:19:11,840 --> 02:19:16,318
and as long as the united states

3891
02:19:13,439 --> 02:19:18,719
continues to exploit that superpower

3892
02:19:16,318 --> 02:19:20,718
that it is the talent magnet

3893
02:19:18,718 --> 02:19:22,879
then it should out innovate the

3894
02:19:20,718 --> 02:19:24,239
totalitarian competition

3895
02:19:22,879 --> 02:19:25,839
every time

3896
02:19:24,239 --> 02:19:27,679
so that's

3897
02:19:25,840 --> 02:19:30,318
that's one reason

3898
02:19:27,679 --> 02:19:32,000
for being an optimist

3899
02:19:30,318 --> 02:19:34,000
another reason and it's quite a

3900
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:35,519
historical reason as you would expect

3901
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,760
from me

3902
02:19:35,519 --> 02:19:40,478
another reason that i'm

3903
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:43,280
optimistic is

3904
02:19:40,478 --> 02:19:45,438
that my kids

3905
02:19:43,280 --> 02:19:48,640
give me a great deal of hope they range

3906
02:19:45,439 --> 02:19:50,318
in age from 27 down to four

3907
02:19:48,639 --> 02:19:52,799
but each of them

3908
02:19:50,318 --> 02:19:55,840
in their different way

3909
02:19:52,799 --> 02:19:57,039
seems to be finding a way

3910
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:00,880
through this

3911
02:19:57,040 --> 02:20:03,600
crazy time of ours without losing

3912
02:20:00,879 --> 02:20:06,559
contact with

3913
02:20:03,600 --> 02:20:08,880
that culture and civilization

3914
02:20:06,559 --> 02:20:11,840
that i hold dear i don't want to live in

3915
02:20:08,879 --> 02:20:13,759
the metaverse as mark zuckerberg

3916
02:20:11,840 --> 02:20:15,760
imagines it to me that's a kind of

3917
02:20:13,760 --> 02:20:16,719
ghastly hell

3918
02:20:15,760 --> 02:20:19,359
i

3919
02:20:16,719 --> 02:20:20,879
think western civilization is the best

3920
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:23,760
civilization

3921
02:20:20,879 --> 02:20:27,438
and i think that almost all the truths

3922
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:28,719
about the human condition can be found

3923
02:20:27,439 --> 02:20:30,639
in western

3924
02:20:28,719 --> 02:20:31,679
literature

3925
02:20:30,639 --> 02:20:34,239
art

3926
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:36,159
and music

3927
02:20:34,239 --> 02:20:37,520
and i think also that the the

3928
02:20:36,159 --> 02:20:40,159
civilization that produced the

3929
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:42,479
scientific revolution has produced the

3930
02:20:40,159 --> 02:20:44,559
great problem-solving

3931
02:20:42,478 --> 02:20:46,079
tool that eluded the other civilizations

3932
02:20:44,559 --> 02:20:48,879
that never really

3933
02:20:46,079 --> 02:20:51,439
cracked science

3934
02:20:48,879 --> 02:20:53,438
and what gives me hope is that despite

3935
02:20:51,439 --> 02:20:54,680
all the temptations and distractions

3936
02:20:53,439 --> 02:20:55,840
that their generation

3937
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:58,159
[Music]

3938
02:20:55,840 --> 02:21:00,159
had to contend with my children in their

3939
02:20:58,159 --> 02:21:01,680
different ways have found the

3940
02:21:00,159 --> 02:21:05,520
found their way

3941
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:06,479
uh to literature and to art and to music

3942
02:21:05,520 --> 02:21:09,120
and

3943
02:21:06,478 --> 02:21:10,799
and they are civilized

3944
02:21:09,120 --> 02:21:12,800
and i i don't

3945
02:21:10,799 --> 02:21:14,478
i don't claim

3946
02:21:12,799 --> 02:21:17,759
much of the credit for that i've done my

3947
02:21:14,478 --> 02:21:18,639
best but i think it's deeply encouraging

3948
02:21:17,760 --> 02:21:21,120
that

3949
02:21:18,639 --> 02:21:22,799
that that they found their way to the

3950
02:21:21,120 --> 02:21:25,200
things that i think

3951
02:21:22,799 --> 02:21:27,920
are indispensable for a happy life a

3952
02:21:25,200 --> 02:21:30,079
fulfilled life nobody i think can be

3953
02:21:27,920 --> 02:21:32,000
truly fulfilled

3954
02:21:30,079 --> 02:21:34,398
if they're cut off from the great body

3955
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,280
of western literature for example i've

3956
02:21:34,398 --> 02:21:36,959
thought

3957
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:39,200
a lot about

3958
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:41,519
elon's argument that we might be in a

3959
02:21:39,200 --> 02:21:43,680
simulation

3960
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:44,800
no no there is a simulation it's cold

3961
02:21:43,680 --> 02:21:46,960
literature

3962
02:21:44,799 --> 02:21:49,039
and we just have to decide whether or

3963
02:21:46,959 --> 02:21:49,919
not to enter it

3964
02:21:49,040 --> 02:21:52,160
i'm

3965
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:56,200
currently in the midst of

3966
02:21:52,159 --> 02:21:58,799
the later stages of of proust's great

3967
02:21:56,200 --> 02:22:00,319
allah and

3968
02:21:58,799 --> 02:22:02,079
observation of

3969
02:22:00,318 --> 02:22:05,519
human relationships is perhaps more

3970
02:22:02,079 --> 02:22:08,398
meticulous than that of any other writer

3971
02:22:05,520 --> 02:22:10,159
and it's impossible not to find yourself

3972
02:22:08,398 --> 02:22:12,159
identifying with

3973
02:22:10,159 --> 02:22:14,318
marcel and his

3974
02:22:12,159 --> 02:22:17,200
obsessive jealous relationships

3975
02:22:14,318 --> 02:22:19,840
particularly with alberti

3976
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:20,960
it's the simulation and you you decide i

3977
02:22:19,840 --> 02:22:25,040
think

3978
02:22:20,959 --> 02:22:26,879
as a sentient being how far to

3979
02:22:25,040 --> 02:22:29,520
in your own life

3980
02:22:26,879 --> 02:22:31,199
reenact these more profound

3981
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:33,439
experiences that others have written

3982
02:22:31,200 --> 02:22:36,399
down one of my earliest literary

3983
02:22:33,439 --> 02:22:38,720
simulations was to reenact jack kerouac

3984
02:22:36,398 --> 02:22:40,639
tripping on the road when i was 17

3985
02:22:38,719 --> 02:22:42,639
culminating and getting very wasted in

3986
02:22:40,639 --> 02:22:43,439
the hanging gardens of zochimilco not to

3987
02:22:42,639 --> 02:22:46,239
be

3988
02:22:43,439 --> 02:22:48,239
not to be missed and

3989
02:22:46,239 --> 02:22:50,478
it hit me just just as i was reading

3990
02:22:48,239 --> 02:22:52,799
proof that's really how to live a rich

3991
02:22:50,478 --> 02:22:53,679
life that one lives life but one lives

3992
02:22:52,799 --> 02:22:56,239
it

3993
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:58,479
juxtaposing one's own experience

3994
02:22:56,239 --> 02:23:00,719
against the more refined experiences of

3995
02:22:58,478 --> 02:23:04,318
the great the great writers so it gives

3996
02:23:00,719 --> 02:23:06,398
me hope that my children do that a bit

3997
02:23:04,318 --> 02:23:08,639
do you include the

3998
02:23:06,398 --> 02:23:10,239
the russian authors very much in the

3999
02:23:08,639 --> 02:23:12,799
canon

4000
02:23:10,239 --> 02:23:15,119
yes i don't read russian um

4001
02:23:12,799 --> 02:23:17,039
but i was entirely obsessed with russian

4002
02:23:15,120 --> 02:23:19,760
literature as a schoolboy

4003
02:23:17,040 --> 02:23:22,080
i read my way through dostoyevsky

4004
02:23:19,760 --> 02:23:24,719
tolstoy turganyev

4005
02:23:22,079 --> 02:23:27,439
i uh check off

4006
02:23:24,719 --> 02:23:29,840
i think um

4007
02:23:27,439 --> 02:23:31,840
of all of those writers

4008
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:33,760
tolstoy had the biggest impact because

4009
02:23:31,840 --> 02:23:35,920
at the end of war and peace there's this

4010
02:23:33,760 --> 02:23:37,520
great essay on historical determinism

4011
02:23:35,920 --> 02:23:39,840
which i think was the reason i became a

4012
02:23:37,520 --> 02:23:42,399
historian

4013
02:23:39,840 --> 02:23:44,639
but i'm i'm really

4014
02:23:42,398 --> 02:23:46,799
temperamentally a kind of togenyev

4015
02:23:44,639 --> 02:23:48,000
person

4016
02:23:46,799 --> 02:23:50,079
oddly enough

4017
02:23:48,000 --> 02:23:52,318
i i think if you if you haven't read

4018
02:23:50,079 --> 02:23:55,760
those novelists i mean you can't really

4019
02:23:52,318 --> 02:23:56,959
be a complete human being if you haven't

4020
02:23:55,760 --> 02:23:59,600
if you haven't read the brothers

4021
02:23:56,959 --> 02:24:01,919
karamazov you will not really

4022
02:23:59,600 --> 02:24:03,359
you're not grown up and so i think i

4023
02:24:01,920 --> 02:24:04,719
think in many ways those are the

4024
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:07,040
greatest

4025
02:24:04,719 --> 02:24:09,679
the greatest novels raskolnikov's

4026
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:12,080
remember raskolnikov's nightmare at the

4027
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:15,439
end of crime and punishment

4028
02:24:12,079 --> 02:24:19,200
in which he imagines in his dream a

4029
02:24:15,439 --> 02:24:20,479
world in which a terrible virus spreads

4030
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:22,399
do you remember this

4031
02:24:20,478 --> 02:24:24,559
and this virus has the effect of making

4032
02:24:22,398 --> 02:24:27,519
every individual think

4033
02:24:24,559 --> 02:24:28,559
that what he believes is right

4034
02:24:27,520 --> 02:24:30,560
and

4035
02:24:28,559 --> 02:24:32,478
in this

4036
02:24:30,559 --> 02:24:34,959
self-righteousness

4037
02:24:32,478 --> 02:24:36,719
uh people fall on one another and commit

4038
02:24:34,959 --> 02:24:38,559
appalling violence

4039
02:24:36,719 --> 02:24:41,679
that's raskolnikov's nightmare and it's

4040
02:24:38,559 --> 02:24:44,000
a prophecy it's a terrible prophecy of

4041
02:24:41,680 --> 02:24:45,760
of russia's future

4042
02:24:44,000 --> 02:24:47,840
yeah it's uh

4043
02:24:45,760 --> 02:24:50,000
and coupled with that is probably the i

4044
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:52,639
also like the french the existentialist

4045
02:24:50,000 --> 02:24:55,600
all that that the full spectrum and

4046
02:24:52,639 --> 02:24:57,599
germans hermann has said and just that

4047
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:59,439
range of human thought has expressed the

4048
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:01,040
literature it's fascinating i really

4049
02:24:59,439 --> 02:25:04,000
love your idea that

4050
02:25:01,040 --> 02:25:04,000
the simulation

4051
02:25:04,478 --> 02:25:10,000
like

4052
02:25:06,000 --> 02:25:12,478
one way to to live life is to kind of

4053
02:25:10,000 --> 02:25:14,159
explore these other worlds and borrow

4054
02:25:12,478 --> 02:25:16,959
from them yes

4055
02:25:14,159 --> 02:25:19,039
wisdom that you then just map onto your

4056
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:21,119
own lives you almost like stitched

4057
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:22,800
together your life with these kind of

4058
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:26,079
pieces from literature the highly

4059
02:25:22,799 --> 02:25:28,318
educated person is constantly struck

4060
02:25:26,079 --> 02:25:30,639
by illusion

4061
02:25:28,318 --> 02:25:32,239
everything is an allusion to something

4062
02:25:30,639 --> 02:25:33,680
that one has read

4063
02:25:32,239 --> 02:25:36,478
and that

4064
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:39,359
is the simulation that's what

4065
02:25:36,478 --> 02:25:41,920
the real metaverse is it's the imaginary

4066
02:25:39,359 --> 02:25:44,079
world that we enter when we read

4067
02:25:41,920 --> 02:25:45,760
empathize and then recognize in our

4068
02:25:44,079 --> 02:25:47,760
daily lives

4069
02:25:45,760 --> 02:25:49,359
some scrap of

4070
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:50,880
the shared experience that literature

4071
02:25:49,359 --> 02:25:53,680
gives us

4072
02:25:50,879 --> 02:25:55,920
yeah i think i've uh aspired to be the

4073
02:25:53,680 --> 02:25:58,239
idiot from prince mishkin from

4074
02:25:55,920 --> 02:26:01,760
dostoevsky and in

4075
02:25:58,239 --> 02:26:05,119
aspiring to be that i have become

4076
02:26:01,760 --> 02:26:06,639
the idiot i feel at least in part

4077
02:26:05,120 --> 02:26:09,439
um

4078
02:26:06,639 --> 02:26:12,318
what you mentioned the human condition

4079
02:26:09,439 --> 02:26:14,479
does love have to do

4080
02:26:12,318 --> 02:26:16,239
what role does it play in the human

4081
02:26:14,478 --> 02:26:19,239
condition friendship

4082
02:26:16,239 --> 02:26:19,239
love

4083
02:26:20,239 --> 02:26:23,199
love

4084
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:25,680
is

4085
02:26:23,200 --> 02:26:25,680
the drug

4086
02:26:26,799 --> 02:26:31,759
kind is uh this was a great roxy music

4087
02:26:30,318 --> 02:26:35,760
line

4088
02:26:31,760 --> 02:26:38,398
uh that brian ferry wrote and love is

4089
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:40,478
uh the most powerful and and dangerous

4090
02:26:38,398 --> 02:26:43,680
of all the drugs

4091
02:26:40,478 --> 02:26:43,679
uh the um

4092
02:26:44,079 --> 02:26:49,680
the

4093
02:26:45,200 --> 02:26:52,960
driving force that overrides our reason

4094
02:26:49,680 --> 02:26:56,479
and of course uh it is the

4095
02:26:52,959 --> 02:26:58,559
it is the primal it's the primal urge

4096
02:26:56,478 --> 02:27:01,519
so

4097
02:26:58,559 --> 02:27:05,519
what a civilized society has to do is to

4098
02:27:01,520 --> 02:27:07,840
prevent that drug that primal force from

4099
02:27:05,520 --> 02:27:08,880
creating mayhem so there have to be

4100
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:09,840
rules

4101
02:27:08,879 --> 02:27:11,358
uh

4102
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:12,559
like monogamy

4103
02:27:11,359 --> 02:27:15,280
and

4104
02:27:12,559 --> 02:27:17,760
rituals like like marriage that that

4105
02:27:15,280 --> 02:27:19,439
reign love in and make the

4106
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:21,680
the addicts

4107
02:27:19,439 --> 02:27:25,280
uh at least

4108
02:27:21,680 --> 02:27:26,559
more or less uh under control and i i

4109
02:27:25,280 --> 02:27:30,319
think that's

4110
02:27:26,559 --> 02:27:34,079
that's part of why i'm i'm a romantic

4111
02:27:30,318 --> 02:27:36,799
rather than a you know steve pinker

4112
02:27:34,079 --> 02:27:39,600
enlightenment rationalist because

4113
02:27:36,799 --> 02:27:41,199
the romantics realized that that love

4114
02:27:39,600 --> 02:27:42,960
was the drug

4115
02:27:41,200 --> 02:27:45,600
it's like

4116
02:27:42,959 --> 02:27:49,438
the difference in sensibility

4117
02:27:45,600 --> 02:27:52,079
between uh handel and wagner

4118
02:27:49,439 --> 02:27:53,920
and i i had a vagnerian phase when i was

4119
02:27:52,079 --> 02:27:55,280
an undergraduate i still remember

4120
02:27:53,920 --> 02:27:57,520
thinking

4121
02:27:55,280 --> 02:28:00,239
that in in

4122
02:27:57,520 --> 02:28:02,640
uh as old as libra's toad

4123
02:28:00,239 --> 02:28:05,039
that wagner had got the closest to sex

4124
02:28:02,639 --> 02:28:06,879
that anybody had ever got

4125
02:28:05,040 --> 02:28:09,200
in in music

4126
02:28:06,879 --> 02:28:10,478
or perhaps to love

4127
02:28:09,200 --> 02:28:14,240
i'm i'm

4128
02:28:10,478 --> 02:28:16,239
lucky that i love my wife and that uh

4129
02:28:14,239 --> 02:28:18,639
that we were

4130
02:28:16,239 --> 02:28:21,760
by the time we met

4131
02:28:18,639 --> 02:28:23,840
you know smart enough to understand

4132
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:25,840
that that love is a drug that you have

4133
02:28:23,840 --> 02:28:29,280
to kind of take

4134
02:28:25,840 --> 02:28:30,398
in in in certain careful ways

4135
02:28:29,280 --> 02:28:32,399
and that

4136
02:28:30,398 --> 02:28:34,398
it works best in

4137
02:28:32,398 --> 02:28:36,398
the context of a

4138
02:28:34,398 --> 02:28:38,559
of a stable family

4139
02:28:36,398 --> 02:28:39,599
that's that's the key thing that one has

4140
02:28:38,559 --> 02:28:42,719
to sort of

4141
02:28:39,600 --> 02:28:45,680
take the drug and then submit to the

4142
02:28:42,719 --> 02:28:47,199
the the conventions of of of marriage

4143
02:28:45,680 --> 02:28:49,439
and family life

4144
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:49,439
i

4145
02:28:49,840 --> 02:28:55,840
i think in that respect

4146
02:28:52,398 --> 02:28:57,358
i'm a kind of tamed romantic contain

4147
02:28:55,840 --> 02:28:58,639
romantic that's how i would like to

4148
02:28:57,359 --> 02:29:01,280
think about it and that's the degree to

4149
02:28:58,639 --> 02:29:03,199
which your romanticism is tamed can be

4150
02:29:01,280 --> 02:29:04,720
then channeled into productive work

4151
02:29:03,200 --> 02:29:06,720
that's why you're a historian and a

4152
02:29:04,719 --> 02:29:08,159
writer is the breast is that love is

4153
02:29:06,719 --> 02:29:09,599
channeled through the writing so if

4154
02:29:08,159 --> 02:29:12,159
you're going to be addicted to anything

4155
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:14,399
be addicted to work

4156
02:29:12,159 --> 02:29:16,159
i mean we're all addictive but yeah the

4157
02:29:14,398 --> 02:29:19,680
thing about workaholism is that it is

4158
02:29:16,159 --> 02:29:23,359
the most productive addiction and uh

4159
02:29:19,680 --> 02:29:24,559
and rather that than drugs or booze so i

4160
02:29:23,359 --> 02:29:26,159
i'm i'm

4161
02:29:24,559 --> 02:29:28,719
yes i'm always trying to channel my

4162
02:29:26,159 --> 02:29:31,200
anxieties in into work

4163
02:29:28,719 --> 02:29:33,519
i learnt that at a relatively early age

4164
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:36,479
it's a sort of massively productive way

4165
02:29:33,520 --> 02:29:39,200
of coping with the inner demons

4166
02:29:36,478 --> 02:29:40,799
and again we should teach kids that

4167
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:42,399
because

4168
02:29:40,799 --> 02:29:43,840
let's come back to our earlier

4169
02:29:42,398 --> 02:29:45,358
conversation about universities part of

4170
02:29:43,840 --> 02:29:48,239
what happens at university is that

4171
02:29:45,359 --> 02:29:50,800
adolescents have to overcome all the

4172
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:52,719
inner demons and these include

4173
02:29:50,799 --> 02:29:54,478
deep insecurity

4174
02:29:52,719 --> 02:29:56,478
about one's appearance about one's

4175
02:29:54,478 --> 02:29:59,039
intellect and then

4176
02:29:56,478 --> 02:30:01,199
madly raging hormones that cause you to

4177
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:02,560
behave like a complete fool with

4178
02:30:01,200 --> 02:30:04,319
the people to whom you're sexually

4179
02:30:02,559 --> 02:30:06,959
attracted all of this is going on in the

4180
02:30:04,318 --> 02:30:08,959
university how can it be a safe space

4181
02:30:06,959 --> 02:30:10,478
it's a completely dangerous space by

4182
02:30:08,959 --> 02:30:11,759
definition

4183
02:30:10,478 --> 02:30:13,760
yeah so

4184
02:30:11,760 --> 02:30:16,239
so yeah teaching young people how to

4185
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:18,478
manage these storms uh

4186
02:30:16,239 --> 02:30:20,000
you know that's part of the job and and

4187
02:30:18,478 --> 02:30:21,519
we've we're really not allowed to do

4188
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:23,200
that anymore because we can't talk about

4189
02:30:21,520 --> 02:30:24,720
these things for fear of the title nine

4190
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:27,280
officers kicking down the door and

4191
02:30:24,719 --> 02:30:30,239
dragging us off in chains and like you

4192
02:30:27,280 --> 02:30:31,600
said hard work and something you call

4193
02:30:30,239 --> 02:30:33,280
work ethic

4194
02:30:31,600 --> 02:30:36,800
in civilization

4195
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:38,239
is um is a pretty is a pretty effective

4196
02:30:36,799 --> 02:30:40,559
way to

4197
02:30:38,239 --> 02:30:42,719
achieve i think a kind of happiness in a

4198
02:30:40,559 --> 02:30:46,559
world that's full of anxiety or at least

4199
02:30:42,719 --> 02:30:48,079
exhaustion so sleep well

4200
02:30:46,559 --> 02:30:50,959
well there is there's a beauty to the

4201
02:30:48,079 --> 02:30:52,478
exhaustion too that's why running this

4202
02:30:50,959 --> 02:30:54,719
manual work

4203
02:30:52,478 --> 02:30:57,599
that some some part of us is built for

4204
02:30:54,719 --> 02:31:00,478
that right i mean we are

4205
02:30:57,600 --> 02:31:03,439
products of of evolution and

4206
02:31:00,478 --> 02:31:05,760
our adaptation to a technological world

4207
02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:08,479
is a very imperfect one so

4208
02:31:05,760 --> 02:31:09,680
hence the kind of masochistic urge to to

4209
02:31:08,478 --> 02:31:10,959
run

4210
02:31:09,680 --> 02:31:12,639
uh

4211
02:31:10,959 --> 02:31:15,199
i i'd like

4212
02:31:12,639 --> 02:31:16,159
outdoor exercise i don't really like

4213
02:31:15,200 --> 02:31:20,479
gyms

4214
02:31:16,159 --> 02:31:22,318
so i'll go for long punishing runs in

4215
02:31:20,478 --> 02:31:24,159
in woodland

4216
02:31:22,318 --> 02:31:27,760
hike up hills

4217
02:31:24,159 --> 02:31:29,680
i like swimming in lakes and in the sea

4218
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:31,280
because there just has to be that

4219
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:33,520
physical

4220
02:31:31,280 --> 02:31:36,319
uh activity in order to do the good

4221
02:31:33,520 --> 02:31:38,159
mental work and so

4222
02:31:36,318 --> 02:31:39,840
it's all about trying to do the best

4223
02:31:38,159 --> 02:31:43,680
work

4224
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:45,760
that's my sense that we we have

4225
02:31:43,680 --> 02:31:47,359
some random allocation of talent you

4226
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:50,159
kind of figure out what it is that

4227
02:31:47,359 --> 02:31:52,640
you're relatively good at and you try to

4228
02:31:50,159 --> 02:31:55,039
do that well i think my father

4229
02:31:52,639 --> 02:31:57,199
encouraged me to think that way

4230
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:59,359
and you don't mind about being average

4231
02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:00,800
at the other stuff the kind of sick

4232
02:31:59,359 --> 02:32:02,640
thing is to try to be brilliant to

4233
02:32:00,799 --> 02:32:04,959
everything i hate those people

4234
02:32:02,639 --> 02:32:06,079
you should really not worry too much if

4235
02:32:04,959 --> 02:32:08,318
you're just

4236
02:32:06,079 --> 02:32:10,318
an average double bass player which i am

4237
02:32:08,318 --> 02:32:12,159
or kind of average skier which i

4238
02:32:10,318 --> 02:32:14,559
definitely am

4239
02:32:12,159 --> 02:32:17,439
doing those things okay is is part of

4240
02:32:14,559 --> 02:32:19,920
leading a rich and fulfilling life

4241
02:32:17,439 --> 02:32:23,040
i was not a good actor but i got a lot

4242
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:25,200
out of acting as an undergraduate turned

4243
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:26,720
out after three years of experimentation

4244
02:32:25,200 --> 02:32:29,120
oxford that i was

4245
02:32:26,719 --> 02:32:31,199
broadly speaking better at writing

4246
02:32:29,120 --> 02:32:34,319
history essays than

4247
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:36,399
uh my peers and that was my edge that

4248
02:32:34,318 --> 02:32:38,639
was my comparative advantage and so i've

4249
02:32:36,398 --> 02:32:41,039
just tried to make a living from from

4250
02:32:38,639 --> 02:32:43,039
that slight edge yeah

4251
02:32:41,040 --> 02:32:44,560
that's a beautiful way to describe a

4252
02:32:43,040 --> 02:32:46,479
life

4253
02:32:44,559 --> 02:32:48,239
is there a meaning to this thing is

4254
02:32:46,478 --> 02:32:49,760
there a meaning to life what is the

4255
02:32:48,239 --> 02:32:52,559
meaning of life

4256
02:32:49,760 --> 02:32:54,239
i was brought up by a physicist and a

4257
02:32:52,559 --> 02:32:55,760
physician

4258
02:32:54,239 --> 02:32:57,520
they were more or less committed

4259
02:32:55,760 --> 02:32:59,280
atheists who had left the church of

4260
02:32:57,520 --> 02:33:01,359
scotland

4261
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:03,280
as a protest against sectarianism in

4262
02:33:01,359 --> 02:33:05,040
glasgow

4263
02:33:03,280 --> 02:33:08,880
and so my sister and i were told from an

4264
02:33:05,040 --> 02:33:09,840
early age life was a cosmic accident

4265
02:33:08,879 --> 02:33:11,679
and

4266
02:33:09,840 --> 02:33:15,200
that was it

4267
02:33:11,680 --> 02:33:15,200
there was no great meaning to it

4268
02:33:16,719 --> 02:33:21,279
and i i can't really get past that

4269
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:24,318
isn't there beauty

4270
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:27,120
to being an accident at a cosmic scale

4271
02:33:24,318 --> 02:33:29,119
yes i wasn't taught to to feel negative

4272
02:33:27,120 --> 02:33:31,040
about that and if anything

4273
02:33:29,120 --> 02:33:33,040
it was a frivolous

4274
02:33:31,040 --> 02:33:35,280
a frivolous insight the whole thing was

4275
02:33:33,040 --> 02:33:36,319
a kind of joke

4276
02:33:35,280 --> 02:33:38,800
um

4277
02:33:36,318 --> 02:33:40,478
and and i think that

4278
02:33:38,799 --> 02:33:42,879
atheism isn't really a basis for

4279
02:33:40,478 --> 02:33:43,679
ordering a society but

4280
02:33:42,879 --> 02:33:44,719
it's

4281
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:46,559
it's

4282
02:33:44,719 --> 02:33:49,679
been all right for me

4283
02:33:46,559 --> 02:33:51,359
i don't have a kind of sense of of a

4284
02:33:49,680 --> 02:33:53,439
missing religious

4285
02:33:51,359 --> 02:33:55,439
faith

4286
02:33:53,439 --> 02:33:59,600
for me

4287
02:33:55,439 --> 02:34:02,398
however there's clearly some embedded

4288
02:33:59,600 --> 02:34:05,680
christian ethics in the way

4289
02:34:02,398 --> 02:34:08,318
my parents lived and so we were kind of

4290
02:34:05,680 --> 02:34:10,960
atheist calvinists

4291
02:34:08,318 --> 02:34:12,398
who had kind of deposed god but carried

4292
02:34:10,959 --> 02:34:15,199
on behaving as if we were members of the

4293
02:34:12,398 --> 02:34:17,680
elect in in a moral universe so

4294
02:34:15,200 --> 02:34:19,600
that's kind of um

4295
02:34:17,680 --> 02:34:21,120
the state of mind that

4296
02:34:19,600 --> 02:34:22,318
i was left in

4297
02:34:21,120 --> 02:34:23,280
and

4298
02:34:22,318 --> 02:34:25,519
i

4299
02:34:23,280 --> 02:34:29,200
i think that

4300
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:31,280
we aren't really around long enough

4301
02:34:29,200 --> 02:34:32,880
to claim that our individual lives have

4302
02:34:31,280 --> 02:34:34,000
meaning

4303
02:34:32,879 --> 02:34:36,079
but what

4304
02:34:34,000 --> 02:34:37,760
edmund burke said is true the real

4305
02:34:36,079 --> 02:34:39,760
social contract is between the

4306
02:34:37,760 --> 02:34:42,559
generations between the dead the living

4307
02:34:39,760 --> 02:34:43,520
and the unborn and the meaning of life

4308
02:34:42,559 --> 02:34:45,119
is

4309
02:34:43,520 --> 02:34:48,159
for me at least

4310
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:50,079
uh to live in a way that honors the dead

4311
02:34:48,159 --> 02:34:51,760
seeks to learn from their accumulated

4312
02:34:50,079 --> 02:34:53,680
wisdom because they do still outnumber

4313
02:34:51,760 --> 02:34:55,920
us they outnumber the

4314
02:34:53,680 --> 02:34:58,960
the living by quite a significant margin

4315
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:59,760
and then to be mindful of the unborn and

4316
02:34:58,959 --> 02:35:00,519
our

4317
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:02,398
our

4318
02:35:00,520 --> 02:35:03,520
responsibility

4319
02:35:02,398 --> 02:35:05,920
to them

4320
02:35:03,520 --> 02:35:07,600
writing books is a way of communicating

4321
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:09,920
with the unborn

4322
02:35:07,600 --> 02:35:11,520
it may or may not succeed and probably

4323
02:35:09,920 --> 02:35:13,280
won't succeed if my books are never

4324
02:35:11,520 --> 02:35:14,399
assigned by work professors in the

4325
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:16,159
future

4326
02:35:14,398 --> 02:35:18,799
so what we have to do is more than just

4327
02:35:16,159 --> 02:35:22,159
write books and record podcasts there

4328
02:35:18,799 --> 02:35:24,719
have to be institutions i'm 57 now

4329
02:35:22,159 --> 02:35:27,760
i realized recently that succession

4330
02:35:24,719 --> 02:35:29,920
planning had to be the main focus of the

4331
02:35:27,760 --> 02:35:32,239
next 20 years because

4332
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:33,840
there are things that i really care

4333
02:35:32,239 --> 02:35:35,840
about

4334
02:35:33,840 --> 02:35:37,920
that i want future generations to have

4335
02:35:35,840 --> 02:35:38,799
access to

4336
02:35:37,920 --> 02:35:41,120
and

4337
02:35:38,799 --> 02:35:43,438
so the meaning of life i do regard as

4338
02:35:41,120 --> 02:35:45,920
being intergenerational transfer of

4339
02:35:43,439 --> 02:35:45,920
wisdom

4340
02:35:46,239 --> 02:35:50,318
ultimately the species will go extinct

4341
02:35:48,478 --> 02:35:53,039
at some point

4342
02:35:50,318 --> 02:35:55,359
even if we do colonize mars one senses

4343
02:35:53,040 --> 02:35:57,439
that physics will catch up with this

4344
02:35:55,359 --> 02:35:59,680
particular organism but it's in the

4345
02:35:57,439 --> 02:36:01,359
pretty far distant future

4346
02:35:59,680 --> 02:36:03,680
and so the meaning of life is to make

4347
02:36:01,359 --> 02:36:04,880
sure that for as long as there are human

4348
02:36:03,680 --> 02:36:06,880
beings

4349
02:36:04,879 --> 02:36:11,039
they are able to

4350
02:36:06,879 --> 02:36:13,119
live the kind of fulfilled lives

4351
02:36:11,040 --> 02:36:14,240
ethically fulfilled intellectually

4352
02:36:13,120 --> 02:36:16,399
fulfilled

4353
02:36:14,239 --> 02:36:19,039
emotionally fulfilled lives that

4354
02:36:16,398 --> 02:36:22,159
civilization has made possible

4355
02:36:19,040 --> 02:36:24,399
it would be easy for us to revert

4356
02:36:22,159 --> 02:36:27,840
to the uncivilized world

4357
02:36:24,398 --> 02:36:29,119
there's a fantastic book

4358
02:36:27,840 --> 02:36:31,680
that i'm going to

4359
02:36:29,120 --> 02:36:34,079
misremember milos is the captive soul

4360
02:36:31,680 --> 02:36:35,200
the captive mind rather

4361
02:36:34,079 --> 02:36:37,600
which

4362
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:38,640
has a fantastic passage

4363
02:36:37,600 --> 02:36:40,000
here

4364
02:36:38,639 --> 02:36:41,519
he was a

4365
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:43,840
polish

4366
02:36:41,520 --> 02:36:46,079
intellectual who says americans can

4367
02:36:43,840 --> 02:36:48,239
never imagine what it's like

4368
02:36:46,079 --> 02:36:50,799
for civilization to be completely

4369
02:36:48,239 --> 02:36:53,280
destroyed as it was in poland at the end

4370
02:36:50,799 --> 02:36:56,239
of by the end of world war ii to have no

4371
02:36:53,280 --> 02:36:58,319
rule of law to have no security of even

4372
02:36:56,239 --> 02:37:00,159
person never mind property rights they

4373
02:36:58,318 --> 02:37:02,879
can't imagine what that's like and what

4374
02:37:00,159 --> 02:37:05,439
it will lead you to do

4375
02:37:02,879 --> 02:37:07,119
so one reason for teaching history is to

4376
02:37:05,439 --> 02:37:08,000
remind the lucky

4377
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:10,079
uh

4378
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:13,760
generation z members

4379
02:37:10,079 --> 02:37:13,760
of california that

4380
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:18,478
that civilization is a thin film and it

4381
02:37:15,920 --> 02:37:20,559
can be destroyed remarkably easily

4382
02:37:18,478 --> 02:37:22,159
and to preserve civilization is a

4383
02:37:20,559 --> 02:37:24,159
tremendous

4384
02:37:22,159 --> 02:37:25,680
responsibility that we have it's a huge

4385
02:37:24,159 --> 02:37:27,359
responsibility

4386
02:37:25,680 --> 02:37:30,000
and we must we must not destroy

4387
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:32,399
ourselves whether it's in the name of of

4388
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:34,879
wokism or the pursuit of

4389
02:37:32,398 --> 02:37:36,559
the metaverse preserving civilization

4390
02:37:34,879 --> 02:37:39,039
and making it available not just to our

4391
02:37:36,559 --> 02:37:42,719
kids but to people we'll never know

4392
02:37:39,040 --> 02:37:44,000
generations ahead that's the meaning

4393
02:37:42,719 --> 02:37:46,959
and

4394
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:49,040
do so by studying the lessons of history

4395
02:37:46,959 --> 02:37:50,478
right not only studying them but then

4396
02:37:49,040 --> 02:37:52,720
acting on them

4397
02:37:50,478 --> 02:37:55,599
for me the biggest problem is how do we

4398
02:37:52,719 --> 02:37:57,519
apply history more effectively it seems

4399
02:37:55,600 --> 02:38:00,399
as if our institutions including

4400
02:37:57,520 --> 02:38:01,520
government are very very bad at applying

4401
02:38:00,398 --> 02:38:03,439
history

4402
02:38:01,520 --> 02:38:06,319
lessons of history are learnt poorly if

4403
02:38:03,439 --> 02:38:08,398
at all analogies are drawn crudely often

4404
02:38:06,318 --> 02:38:09,840
the wrong inferences are drawn

4405
02:38:08,398 --> 02:38:12,840
one of the big intellectual challenges

4406
02:38:09,840 --> 02:38:14,960
for me is how to make history more

4407
02:38:12,840 --> 02:38:15,680
useful and this was the kind of thing

4408
02:38:14,959 --> 02:38:17,519
that

4409
02:38:15,680 --> 02:38:19,600
professors used to hate but really

4410
02:38:17,520 --> 02:38:21,680
practically useful so that

4411
02:38:19,600 --> 02:38:23,520
policymakers and citizens

4412
02:38:21,680 --> 02:38:24,559
can think about the decisions that they

4413
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:27,200
face with

4414
02:38:24,559 --> 02:38:28,879
a more historically informed

4415
02:38:27,200 --> 02:38:30,880
body of knowledge

4416
02:38:28,879 --> 02:38:33,358
whether it's a pandemic the challenge of

4417
02:38:30,879 --> 02:38:36,478
climate change what to do about taiwan

4418
02:38:33,359 --> 02:38:38,640
i can't think of a better set of

4419
02:38:36,478 --> 02:38:40,559
uh of things to know

4420
02:38:38,639 --> 02:38:42,559
before you make decisions about those

4421
02:38:40,559 --> 02:38:44,318
things than the the things that history

4422
02:38:42,559 --> 02:38:46,159
has to offer well i love the discipline

4423
02:38:44,318 --> 02:38:47,680
of applied history basically going to

4424
02:38:46,159 --> 02:38:48,559
history and saying

4425
02:38:47,680 --> 02:38:49,920
what

4426
02:38:48,559 --> 02:38:52,799
are the

4427
02:38:49,920 --> 02:38:54,879
key principles here that are applicable

4428
02:38:52,799 --> 02:38:56,719
to the problems of today right and how

4429
02:38:54,879 --> 02:38:59,199
can we solve that great philosopher of

4430
02:38:56,719 --> 02:39:00,799
history r.g collingwood

4431
02:38:59,200 --> 02:39:02,800
said in his autobiography which was

4432
02:39:00,799 --> 02:39:04,959
published in 1939

4433
02:39:02,799 --> 02:39:08,478
that the purpose of history

4434
02:39:04,959 --> 02:39:10,959
was to reconstitute past thought

4435
02:39:08,478 --> 02:39:12,000
from whatever surviving remnants there

4436
02:39:10,959 --> 02:39:14,559
were

4437
02:39:12,000 --> 02:39:16,559
and then to juxtapose it

4438
02:39:14,559 --> 02:39:18,959
with our own predicament and that's that

4439
02:39:16,559 --> 02:39:21,279
juxtaposition of past experience with

4440
02:39:18,959 --> 02:39:23,119
present experience that is so important

4441
02:39:21,280 --> 02:39:25,760
we don't do that well

4442
02:39:23,120 --> 02:39:27,680
uh and indeed we've we've flipped it so

4443
02:39:25,760 --> 02:39:30,318
that academic historians now think their

4444
02:39:27,680 --> 02:39:33,280
mission is to travel back to the past

4445
02:39:30,318 --> 02:39:34,639
with the value system of 2021 and

4446
02:39:33,280 --> 02:39:37,200
castigate

4447
02:39:34,639 --> 02:39:40,318
uh the the dead for their racism and

4448
02:39:37,200 --> 02:39:42,000
sexism and transphobia and whatnot and

4449
02:39:40,318 --> 02:39:43,279
that's exactly wrong

4450
02:39:42,000 --> 02:39:45,040
our mission is to go back and try to

4451
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:46,479
understand what it was like to live in

4452
02:39:45,040 --> 02:39:49,200
the 18th century

4453
02:39:46,478 --> 02:39:51,119
not to go back and condescend to the

4454
02:39:49,200 --> 02:39:53,200
the people of the past and once we've

4455
02:39:51,120 --> 02:39:55,280
had a better understanding once we've

4456
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:56,960
seen into their lives read their words

4457
02:39:55,280 --> 02:39:58,239
tried to reconstitute their experience

4458
02:39:56,959 --> 02:40:00,239
to come back

4459
02:39:58,239 --> 02:40:01,760
and understand our own time better

4460
02:40:00,239 --> 02:40:03,359
that's what we should really be doing

4461
02:40:01,760 --> 02:40:05,200
but academic history has gone completely

4462
02:40:03,359 --> 02:40:07,520
haywire and it does almost the exact

4463
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:09,840
opposite of what i think it should do

4464
02:40:07,520 --> 02:40:12,239
and by studying history

4465
02:40:09,840 --> 02:40:14,960
walk beautifully gracefully through the

4466
02:40:12,239 --> 02:40:16,799
simulation as you described by mapping

4467
02:40:14,959 --> 02:40:19,679
the lessons of history into the world of
