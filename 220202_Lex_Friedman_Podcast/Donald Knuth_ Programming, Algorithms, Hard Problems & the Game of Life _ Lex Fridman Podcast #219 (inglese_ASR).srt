00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,480
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,599
donald knuth his second time on this

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,240
podcast

4
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:09,919
don is a legendary computer scientist

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,320
touring award winner

6
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,400
father of algorithm analysis

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,440
author of the art of computer

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,480
programming creator of tech that led to

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,800
late tech and one of the kindest and

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
most fascinating human beings i've ever

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,599
got a chance to talk to

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,560
i wrote him a letter a long time ago he

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,719
responded and the rest as they say is

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,879
history we've interacted many times

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,039
since then and every time it's been

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,040
joyful and inspiring

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,359

this is the lex friedman podcast and

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,159
here is my conversation with donald

21
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,039
knuth

22
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,679
your first large-scale program you wrote

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,719
it in ibm 650 assembler in the summer of

24
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,799
1957. i wrote it in decimal machine

25
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,320
language i didn't know about assembler

26
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:04,719
until a year later but the year 1957 the

27
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,159
year and the program

28
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:07,760
yeah i might have learned about it

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,560
assembler later that summary i probably

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,000
did in 1957 hardly anybody had heard of

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,200
assemblers you looked at the user

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,640
manuals

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,719
how did you write a program for this

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,359
machine it would be it would

35
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,200
it would say um

36
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,799
you know you would say 69 which meant

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,040
load the distributor and and then you

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,280
would give the address of the number you

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,720
wanted to load into the distributor

40
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,960
uh yesterday

41
00:01:28,719 --> 00:01:32,560
uh my friend that

42
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:34,559
doug spicer at the computer history

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
museum sent me a link to

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,320
something that just went on youtube it

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,200
was the ibm's

46
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:45,039
progress report from 1956 which is you

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:49,280
know very contemporary with 1957 yes

48
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:52,399
and in 1956 ibm had donated to stanford

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,519
university on ibm 650 one of the first

50
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,879
ones

51
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:57,438
when they showed a picture of the

52
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:59,280
assembly line for ibm 650s and they said

53
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,519
you know this is number 500 or something

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,799
coming off the assembly line and i had

55
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:05,840
never

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,479
seen so many ibm 650s i did in this

57
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,598
movie that was a it's on youtube now

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,800
um

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,959
and

60
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,319
and it showed the picture from

61
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,280
stanford

62
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:19,598
uh that that you know they they said

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,439
look you know we donated one of these to

64
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:22,878
stanford one to mit and they mentioned

65
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,400
one other

66
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:27,120
another college

67
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,760
and in in december of 56 they donated to

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,120
to my university case tech

69
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,359
but anyway

70
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,159
they showed a picture then

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,920
a class session

72
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,878
where a guy was teaching programming and

73
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:43,039
on the blackboard it said 69

74
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,639
8 000 i mean he

75
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:46,560
it was

76
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,359
he was teaching them how to write

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,159
uh

78
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,120
code for this ibm 650 which was in

79
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,878
decimal

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,959
numbers

81
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,919
so so the instructions were tended ten

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,120
decimal digits you had two digits that

83
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,318
said what

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,400
what to do for they just say uh

85
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:06,399
uh what to do it too

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
and four more digits to say where to get

87
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,840
your next instruction

88
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,919
and there's a manual that describes what

89
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,680
each of the numbers mean and the manual

90
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,518
was actually one

91
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,560
if the manual had been well written i

92
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,158
probably never would have gone into

93
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,080
computer science but it was so badly

94
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,399
written i figured

95
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,480
that i must have a talent for it because

96
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,239
i'm only a freshman and i and i could

97
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,959
write a better manual

98
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,719
uh

99
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,280
and that he did

100
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:34,000
and so i i started working at the

101
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,120
computer center um

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,318
and

103
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:39,200
and uh

104
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:41,039
wrote some manuals then but but yeah but

105
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:42,719
but this was uh

106
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:46,639
but this was the way we did it and and

107
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:48,318
my first program then was june of 1957

108
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,798
the tic-tac-toe

109
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:53,679
no that was the second program the first

110
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,719
the third program the first program was

111
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,360
factoring

112
00:03:54,719 --> 00:03:58,080
a number okay so you dial a number on

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
the

114
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,080
on the um

115
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,000
uh their switches that means you sat at

116
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,120
this big mainframe

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,239
and

118
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,719
and you turn the dials and set a number

119
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,519
and and then it would punch out uh the

120
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:16,079
factors of that number on on cars so

121
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,358
that's the input is the number the input

122
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,918
was

123
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:22,159
yeah the input what was the number yeah

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:25,359
attended a number and

125
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,120
and uh and the output was uh its factors

126
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,400
and and and i wrote that program

127
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,040
uh

128
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:35,679
i still have a copy of it somewhere

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,439
and um how many lines of code do you

130
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,800
remember well yeah it started out as

131
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,959
about

132
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,600
20 but then i kept having to debug it

133
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:45,439
and i i discovered debugging of course

134
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,919
when i wrote my first program and what

135
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,800
does uh debugging look like

136
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:53,279
on a program with just all numbers

137
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,639
well you sit there and you uh i don't

138
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,159
remember how i got it into the machine

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,240
but i but i think there was a way to

140
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,160
punch punch it on cards so each each

141
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,560
instruction would would be one

142
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,600
one card or maybe i could get seven

143
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,519
instructions on the card eight

144
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,439
instructions i don't know but anyway

145
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:08,639
so i'm sitting there at the console of

146
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:10,478
the machine i mean i'm doing this at

147
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:12,560
night when nobody else is around of

148
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,800
course um and

149
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,478
and so you have one set of switches

150
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,840
where you can dial the number i'm

151
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:19,680
inputting but there's another switch

152
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:21,519
that's it that you know that says okay

153
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,519
now execute one instruction and show me

154
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:25,758
what you thought what you did

155
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,918
or or you or you

156
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,000
there was another four switches and say

157
00:05:27,918 --> 00:05:31,519
stop if you get to those if if you get

158
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,360
to that instruction

159
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:35,279
so so i can say now go until you get

160
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
there again and watch okay so i could

161
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:38,879
watch

162
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:40,399
you know it he would take that number

163
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,360
and it would divide it by two and if

164
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,198
it's

165
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,439
you know there's no remainder then okay

166
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,160
two is a factor so

167
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,560
so then i work on the but if if not

168
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,280
divisible by two divide by three okay

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,680
keep trying and you know

170
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:58,239
until you know you're you're at the end

171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,639
and uh you would find a bug

172
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,720
if uh if you were just surprised that

173
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,240
something weird happened

174
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,039
well certainly i mean

175
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,879
first of all i might have it

176
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,879
you know try to divide by one instead of

177
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,560
two you off by one errors that people

178
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,879
make all the time you know but but maybe

179
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,800
i go to the wrong instruction maybe i

180
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:18,879
you might maybe i uh

181
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,360
i left left something in a register that

182
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,399
i shouldn't have done but the first bugs

183
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,479
were pretty you know i i i probably

184
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,079
on the first night i was able to i was

185
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,879
able to get the factors of 30 you know

186
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:34,079
as equal to two three and five okay

187
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,000
um so you're sorry to interrupt you were

188
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,680
so you're sitting there late at night

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,319
yeah so

190
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,280
it feels like you spent many years late

191
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,439
at night working on a computer oh yeah

192
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,439
so like what what's that like so most

193
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:49,279
the world is sleeping

194
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:50,639
and you have to be there at night

195
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,399
because that's when you get access to

196
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:54,240
the computer between my freshman

197
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:55,038
sophomore year i didn't need sleep you

198
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,879
know

199
00:06:55,038 --> 00:06:58,399
i used to do all-nighters when i was in

200
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,680
high school i used to

201
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:00,638
i used to

202
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,199
do the

203
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,879
uh the whole student newspaper every

204
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,879
monday night i would i would you know i

205
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,680
would just stay up all night and

206
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:11,120
and it would be done on tuesday morning

207
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,519
um

208
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,120
that was because i i didn't get ulcers

209
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:18,399
and stuff like that until later you know

210
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,478
but but but uh well the uh i don't know

211
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,120
if you know rodney brooks rod brooks of

212
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,478
course yeah he he he told he told me a

213
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,560
story that

214
00:07:24,478 --> 00:07:28,159
he really you're you know he really

215
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,000
looked up to you he was actually afraid

216
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,400
of you

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,720
vice versa i must say

218
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,239
but when he tells a story when you were

219
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,759
working on tech

220
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,800
that they screwed up something with a

221
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,479
machine

222
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
i think this might have been mit i don't

223
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,359
know

224
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,520
and you were waiting for them to fix the

225
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,759
machine so you can get back to work late

226
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:49,439
at night oh oh

227
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,280
that happened all the time

228
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:54,000
he was really intimidated he's like dr

229
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,638
newt is not happy with this

230
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,759
that's interesting but no no the the

231
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,918
machine at stanford ai lab was

232
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,038
uh uh i

233
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,758
was down

234
00:08:03,038 --> 00:08:07,759
an awful lot because we they had

235
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,598
they had many talented programmers

236
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,680
changing the operating system every day

237
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:13,360
and so operating system was getting

238
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,759
better every day but

239
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,560
it was also crashing so so so i i wrote

240
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,280
almost the entire manual for tech during

241
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,879
down time

242
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:24,399
[Music]

243
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,160
that much but that's another story okay

244
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:28,638
well he was saying they uh it's a

245
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,879
hardware problem they they uh they tried

246
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:33,519
to fix it and they reinserted something

247
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,278
and smoke was everywhere because he was

248
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,000
hurt well that didn't happen as often as

249
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,519
the operation coming from but yeah

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,038
and it was it's a funny story because

251
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,080
you're saying there's this

252
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,679
tall

253
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,920
uh don knuth that i look up to and

254
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,000
there was pressure to i think it's the

255
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:51,199
computer well

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,278
it's funny

257
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,360
okay the kind of things we remember that

258
00:08:53,278 --> 00:08:57,519
stick in our memory well okay yeah well

259
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,440
i i i could tell you a bunch of rod

260
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:02,159
brooks stories too but let's

261
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,640
let's let let's go back to the 650. so

262
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:04,639
so um

263
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
so i'm debugging this my first program

264
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:12,639
and and i i

265
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,480
i had more bugs in it than a number of

266
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:16,159
lines of code i i mean the number of

267
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,320
lines of code kept growing

268
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,319
and let me explain so so i had to punch

269
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,800
the answers on cards all right

270
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,080
so so suppose i suppose i'm factoring

271
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:28,639
the number 30 then i got then it i got a

272
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,000
i got to put two

273
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,439
somewhere on the card i got to put a

274
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,600
three somewhere on the card i got to put

275
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,680
a five somewhere on the card right and

276
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,320
and you know what my i was my first

277
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,599
program i i probably screwed up and you

278
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
know it

279
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,360
it fell off the edge of the card or

280
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,440
something like that but but i didn't

281
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,360
realize that there are some tentative

282
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,200
numbers that have

283
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:53,200
that have more than eight um factors

284
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,920
and the card has only 80 columns and so

285
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,839
i need 10 columns for every factor

286
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:59,360
so my first program didn't take account

287
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,040
for the fact that i would have to punch

288
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,720
more than one card

289
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,240
my first program you know just line the

290
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,639
stuff up in memory and then it punched

291
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,720
the card but but after you know so by

292
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:12,319
the time i finished i had to i had to

293
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,560
deal with lots of lots of things also i

294
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,480
uh uh

295
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:19,119
if you if you put a large prime number

296
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,360
in there my program might have sat there

297
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,039
for for 10 minutes the 650 was pretty

298
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,240
slow and so it would sit there spinning

299
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,480
its wheels and you wouldn't know if it

300
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,519
was in a loop or whatever you said ten

301
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,240
digit

302
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,320
ten digits yeah so i think the largest

303
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,159
is sort of nine nine nine nine nine nine

304
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,120
nine nine nine seven or something like

305
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,799
that and

306
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,839
that would you know that that would take

307
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:39,039
me a while

308
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,399
uh

309
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,240
for that first one anyway that was my

310
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,919
first program well what was your goal

311
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
with that program well there's something

312
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:45,838
you were

313
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,399
hoping to

314
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,560
find a large prime maybe or no

315
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,480
the opposite you know my goal was to see

316
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:55,039
the lights flashing and

317
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,039
understand how how this magical machine

318
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:59,439
would be able to do something that took

319
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:02,078
so long by hand so what was your second

320
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,839
program my second program was

321
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,759
uh was

322
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,720
a converted number

323
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:08,559
from

324
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,480
from binary to decimal or something like

325
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,078
that it was much much simpler it didn't

326
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,959
have that many bugs in it

327
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,879
my third program was tic-tac-toe yeah

328
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:19,119
and he had some machi so the the the

329
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,120
tic-tac-toe program

330
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,879
is interesting on many levels but one of

331
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,519
them is that it has some

332
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:26,799
you can call machine learning in it

333
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,879
that's

334
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:29,838
yeah that's right uh

335
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:31,120
uh

336
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,240
i don't know how long it's going to be

337
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,440
before

338
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,278
the name of

339
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,120
our field has changed from computer

340
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:38,639
science to machine learning

341
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,919
but

342
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:43,679
but anyway uh uh it it was my first

343
00:11:41,919 --> 00:11:45,838
experience with machine learning because

344
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,439
okay so here we had yeah how does the

345
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,240
program well first of all

346
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,079
what is the problem you were solving

347
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,120
what is tic tac toe what are we talking

348
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,638
about and then um right

349
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,320
how was it designed

350
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,879
right so so

351
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
you got a three by three grid and each

352
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,879
each each

353
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,278
each could be in three states it can be

354
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:11,278
empty or it can have an x or an o yeah

355
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:13,039
right so three to the ninth is a

356
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:15,439
uh well what is

357
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:18,240
how big is it i should know

358
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,639
um but it's 80

359
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:24,959
81 times 81 times three so

360
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,159
um

361
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:27,759
anyway

362
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,879
eight is like two to the third and so

363
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:31,838
that would be

364
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,958
uh that would be like two to the sixth

365
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:35,839
um

366
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:37,599
uh and then uh but that would be 64 then

367
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,480
you have to anyway i love how you're

368
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,480
doing the calculation

369
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,519
anyway the three comes from the fact

370
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,800
that it's either empty an x or an o

371
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,919
right

372
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,159
and

373
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:52,719
the 650 what was it was a machine that

374
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:55,439
had only uh

375
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,440
two thousand

376
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,799
ten digit words

377
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,120
you go from zero zero zero zero to one

378
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,439
nine nine nine and that's it

379
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,278
and and in each word you have a ten

380
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,160
digit number

381
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,320
so that's not many bits i mean i gotta

382
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,480
have three in order to have a memory of

383
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,560
every position i've seen

384
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,639
i need three to the ninth bits

385
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,039
okay but it was a decimal machine too it

386
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,720
didn't have bits but but but it did have

387
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:26,639
it it did have

388
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
strange instruction

389
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,839
where if if you had a tentative number

390
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,600
that but all the digits were either

391
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,639
eight or nine

392
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,879
uh

393
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,879
you you'd be eight nine nine eight or

394
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,958
something like that that would

395
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:40,639
uh you you could make a test whether it

396
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,679
was eight or nine that was one of the

397
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:47,120
strange things ibm engineers put into to

398
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:50,000
the machine i have no idea what well um

399
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,600
hardly ever used but anyway i i needed

400
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,600
one digit for every

401
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,240
every position i'd seen

402
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,240
uh zero meant it was a bad position i

403
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,959
meant it was good position

404
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,440
i i think i started out at five or six

405
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:05,198
you know but if you if you win a game

406
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,560
then you uh

407
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,719
then you increase the value of that

408
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:10,719
position for you but you decrease it

409
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,559
for your opponent uh uh so but but i i i

410
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:19,039
could

411
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:21,439
i had that much total memory for every

412
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,319
every possible position was one digit

413
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,320
and i had a total of 20 000 digits

414
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,360
which had which had to also include my

415
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,440
program

416
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,440
yes and all the logic and everything

417
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,639
including how to

418
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,720
how to ask

419
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,720
the user what the moves are and things

420
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,480
like this okay so so i think i had to

421
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,800
work it out because get every every

422
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,639
position in tic-tac-toe

423
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,879
it is equivalent to

424
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,879
roughly eight others because you you you

425
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:47,759
can rotate the board

426
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:49,519
um

427
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,439
which gives you factor four and you can

428
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,519
also flip it over

429
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,040
and that's another factor two so so i

430
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,959
might you know so i might have needed

431
00:14:55,039 --> 00:14:58,958
only three to the ninth over eight

432
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:00,319
positions about you know plus

433
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,958
plus a little bit

434
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,519
uh so i had but anyway that was

435
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,359
that was a a part of the program to to

436
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,600
squeeze it into this tiny

437
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,759
so you tried to find an efficient

438
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,519
representation that took account for

439
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:15,919
that kind of rotation i had to otherwise

440
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,360
i couldn't do the learning

441
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:21,759
uh wow so so but but i had three

442
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,399
parts to my tic-tac-toe program

443
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:28,000
uh and i called it brain one brain two

444
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,839
and brain three so brain one

445
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,320
just played

446
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,320
a um

447
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,560
let's see

448
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,440
at random

449
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,958
okay

450
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,040
it's your turn okay you gotta put an x

451
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:43,039
somewhere he has to go in an empty space

452
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,639
but that's that's it okay

453
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:48,000
choose

454
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,680
to choose one and and play it uh

455
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,679
brain two

456
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,679
uh

457
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,838
had a canned routine

458
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,679
and i think it was it also

459
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,959
maybe it had

460
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:01,198
maybe it assumed you were the first

461
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,879
player or maybe it allowed you to be

462
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,639
first i think you were odd to be either

463
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,958
first of a second but had a canned

464
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,029
built-in strategy known to be optimum

465
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:09,119
for tic-tac-toe

466
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:10,720
[Music]

467
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,959
before i forget by the way

468
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,480
i learned uh many years later that

469
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:17,198
charles babbage

470
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,480
had had planned to

471
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:20,559
had thought about programming

472
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,399
tic-tac-toe for his

473
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:24,638
for his dream machine that he that he

474
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,799
was never able to finish wow so that was

475
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,560
the program he thought about more than a

476
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,000
hundred years ago yeah yeah he had he

477
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,119
he did that okay

478
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,039
and i had but and and i had however been

479
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,440
influenced by a

480
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,039
demonstration at the at the museum of

481
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,920
science and industry in chicago it's

482
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:46,480
like it's like boston's science museum i

483
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,198
think bell labs had had prepared a

484
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,039
special exhibit about

485
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:53,439
telephones and relay technology and they

486
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:55,198
had a tic-tac-toe playing

487
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,199
uh

488
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,198
machine as part of that exhibit so that

489
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,519
had been one of my

490
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:03,039
uh you know something i'd seen

491
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,359
before i was a freshman in college and

492
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,639
and inspired me to see if i could write

493
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,759
a program for

494
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,720
okay so so anyway i had brain one

495
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,720
random

496
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,240
you know uh

497
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,199
knowing nothing brain two knowing

498
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,599
everything

499
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:19,120
then brain three was the learning one

500
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,279
and and i could

501
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,958
i i could play

502
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:27,119
brain one against brain one brain one

503
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:28,798
against brain two and so on and so uh

504
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,959
you could also play against the user

505
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,519
against the live members but

506
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,200
but uh so so i started going the the

507
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,119
learning thing and i said okay you know

508
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,880
take two random

509
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:44,239
random people uh just playing uh uh

510
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,679
tic-tac-toe uh uh knowing nothing

511
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
um and

512
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,038
after about i i forget the number now

513
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,919
but but it converged after about 600

514
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:54,558
games

515
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,600
uh uh to a safe draw

516
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,599
the way

517
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,839
my program learned was actually it

518
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,240
learned how not to make mistakes because

519
00:17:59,839 --> 00:18:04,240
you know how to

520
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,558
it didn't try to do anything

521
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,640
for winning it just tried to yeah drop

522
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:10,319
losing and not lose so that was probably

523
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,400
because of the way i did i designed the

524
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,558
learning thing i could have you know

525
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,160
had a different

526
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:16,960
uh reinforcement function that that

527
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,480
would

528
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,759
that would reward brilliant play but

529
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,038
anyway it didn't

530
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:24,960
and uh and and if if i took a novice

531
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,200
against the uh

532
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:30,880
you know the skilled player uh it it was

533
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:33,038
able to learn uh how to play a good game

534
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,240
so that was that and that was really

535
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:37,279
mike

536
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,679
but after i finished that i i felt i i

537
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:41,678
understood programming

538
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,679
was there um

539
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,720
did you

540
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,880
did a curiosity and interest in learning

541
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,319
systems persist for you

542
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,960
so

543
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:54,480
why why did you want brain three to

544
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,679
learn

545
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,319
yeah i i think naturally it's

546
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,640
we're talking about rod brooks like

547
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,480
he he was teaching all kinds of

548
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,320
very small devices

549
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:11,599
to to learn stuff

550
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:13,200
um if a leaf drops off of a tree uh uh

551
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:14,798
you know it

552
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,558
he was saying something well it learns

553
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:18,879
if there's wind or not

554
00:19:16,558 --> 00:19:20,240
but but i i mean he pushed that a little

555
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,760
bit too far but

556
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
he said he could probably train some

557
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:26,558
little mini bugs to to scour out dishes

558
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,880
if he had enough

559
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:32,558
financial support i don't know

560
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,559
can i can i ask you about that because

561
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:37,599
he he also mentioned that during

562
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,519
those years

563
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:43,759
there was discussion about

564
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:46,558
inspired by touring about computation

565
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:47,599
you know of what is computation

566
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:48,960
yeah

567
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,639
and

568
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,880
yeah i never thought about any stuff

569
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,038
like that that was

570
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,640
that that was way

571
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:58,720
too philosophical i mean

572
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,559
i i was a

573
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,000
i was a freshman

574
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:03,918
after all i mean

575
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,038
i i didn't

576
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,880
i was pretty much a machine

577
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,798
so it's almost like yeah i got you it's

578
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,919
a tinkering mindset

579
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,400
uh not a philosophical mindset

580
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,559
it was just exciting to me to

581
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,600
be able to control something but not

582
00:20:18,558 --> 00:20:22,240
but not

583
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:24,399
but not to say hmm am i solving a big

584
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,480
problem or something like that or is is

585
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,240
this a step for humankind right no no

586
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,240
way

587
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,599
when did you first start thinking about

588
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,279
computation in the big sense

589
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,119
you know like the universal turing

590
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:39,759
machine well

591
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,319
i mean i had to pass an ex i

592
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:43,759
had to take i had to take uh

593
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,240
classes on

594
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:47,839
computability when i was a senior

595
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,038
so you know we read this book by martin

596
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:51,759
davis and

597
00:20:49,038 --> 00:20:53,200
yeah this is cool stuff but you know i i

598
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,839
learned about it because i you know i

599
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,000
needed to pass the exams but i didn't

600
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,879
i didn't invent any of that before stuff

601
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,519
but but i i had great fun playing with

602
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:05,039
the machine you know i um i wrote

603
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,960
program because it was fun to write

604
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:08,798
programs and and

605
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,480
and get

606
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,440
this

607
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,360
i i mean it was like watching miracles

608
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,600
happen

609
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:21,599
you mentioned in in an interview that

610
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:23,918
when reading a program you can tell when

611
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,798
the author of the program changed

612
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:28,880
oh okay uh

613
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:31,679
how the heck can you do that like what

614
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,039
makes a distinct style for a programmer

615
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,600
do you think

616
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,759
you know there's different hemingway

617
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:40,639
has a style of writing

618
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:42,640
versus james joyce or something

619
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,480
well those are pretty yeah those are

620
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,919
pretty easy to imitate but

621
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,038
it's the same with music and whatever

622
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,240
you can

623
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:52,079
i i i i found uh

624
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,839
well during the pandemic i

625
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:57,038
spent a lot more time playing the piano

626
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:58,959
and i i found something that i'd had

627
00:21:57,038 --> 00:22:00,400
i i had it right when i was taking

628
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,279
lessons uh

629
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,600
you know

630
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:04,798
before i was a teenager and uh

631
00:22:03,599 --> 00:22:06,879
it was

632
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,440
yankee doodle

633
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,120
uh played in the style of

634
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,519
you know and

635
00:22:11,119 --> 00:22:16,719
i you had you had beethoven and you had

636
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,158
wc and chopin and you know and the last

637
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,038
one was gershwin

638
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:19,840
and

639
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:22,000
and

640
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,399
i played over and over again i thought

641
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,880
it was so brilliant because but

642
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,400
but it was so easy but also to

643
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,159
appreciate how

644
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,360
this uh this

645
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:36,640
author mario somebody or other had

646
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:39,199
had been able to uh reverse engineer

647
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,559
the styles of of those components so but

648
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,640
now specifically uh to your question i

649
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:47,119
mean there would be

650
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,280
there it was

651
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,399
it was pretty obvious in this program i

652
00:22:49,279 --> 00:22:55,200
was reading it was it was a compiler

653
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,519
uh and it had been written by a team

654
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:00,159
at at carnegie mellon

655
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:01,359
and uh i have no idea

656
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,760
which program

657
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,839
was responsible for but but it you would

658
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:08,798
get to a part where the guy would just

659
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,558
not know how he how to move things

660
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:11,359
between registers very efficiently and

661
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:12,798
so

662
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,798
and so everything that

663
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:16,480
that could be done in one instruction

664
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,558
would take three or something like that

665
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,038
that would be a pretty obvious uh

666
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,038
change in style but there were but then

667
00:23:21,038 --> 00:23:24,879
there were also you know flashes of

668
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,839
brilliance where you could do in one

669
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,280
instruction normally i used two because

670
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,119
because you knew enough about the way

671
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,599
the machine worked that you could

672
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,678
that that you could accomplish two goals

673
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,839
in one step

674
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,840
so it was mostly the the brilliance of

675
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,720
the concept more than the

676
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,480
uh semicolons and uh or the

677
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,000
the you know the use of short sentences

678
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:48,159
versus long sentences something like

679
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,640
that so you would see the idea in the

680
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,480
code and you can see the the different

681
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,919
style of thinking experience right it

682
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:57,839
was yeah so it was stylistic

683
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,440
i mean like i could identify authors by

684
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,759
their

685
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,840
by the amount of technical aptitude they

686
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:06,960
had but not by

687
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:06,959
styling the sense of

688
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:12,000
rhythm or something like that so if you

689
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:16,000
think about mozart beethoven bach if

690
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,759
somebody looked at don knuth code would

691
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,599
they be able to tell

692
00:24:17,759 --> 00:24:22,079
that this

693
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:25,359
is a distinct style of thinking going on

694
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,359
here what do you think

695
00:24:26,319 --> 00:24:31,439
and what what would be the defining uh

696
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,559
characteristic of the style

697
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,278
well

698
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,119
my code now is it

699
00:24:35,278 --> 00:24:40,319
is literate programming so i'm it's a

700
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,558
combination of english and c mostly but

701
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,639
but but if you just looked at the c part

702
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,558
of it you would also probably notice

703
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,759
that i don't

704
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,200
got it

705
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,440
you know that i use a lot of global

706
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,319
variables that other people don't and

707
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,240
and and i expand things inline more than

708
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:58,240
instead of calling

709
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,960
anyway i have different

710
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:03,120
subset of c that i use okay but this

711
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,960
that's a little bit stylistic yeah

712
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,199
but but with literate programming you

713
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,440
alternate between english and

714
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,159
and c or whatever

715
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,240
and

716
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,080
um and by the way people listening to

717
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:16,480
this should look up literate programming

718
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,079
it's very interesting uh concept that

719
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,000
you

720
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:21,038
uh you proposed and developed over the

721
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,480
years

722
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,599
yeah yeah

723
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,319
i'm

724
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,319
that's the most

725
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,119
significant thing

726
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:31,918
i think to come out of the tech project

727
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:34,558
is

728
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:37,038
it is that i uh

729
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:37,839
i i realized that

730
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:39,599
uh

731
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:42,319
my programs

732
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:44,000
were to be read by people and not not

733
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:45,918
just by computers and

734
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,720
and that typography could

735
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,480
massively enhance that and

736
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,000
and and so uh

737
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,519
i mean it

738
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,200
they're just wonderful if they're gonna

739
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:57,119
look it up that they should also look up

740
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,240
this book by

741
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:03,038
called physically based rendering

742
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,240
by matt farr and

743
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:05,919
anyway it

744
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,640
got an academy award

745
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:11,200
but it's but but but all the if

746
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,000
on the graphic effects you see in movies

747
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,278
uh

748
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,880
like

749
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,359
you know are accomplished by algorithms

750
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:19,679
and this book it is the whole book is a

751
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:22,319
literate program it tells you not only

752
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,320
how you do all the shading and

753
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,158
and uh

754
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:29,119
bringing images in that you need for

755
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,159
animation and textures and so on but it

756
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:32,959
also uh you can run the code

757
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,799
uh

758
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,159
so uh and

759
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:40,079
and so uh

760
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:43,120
i find it uh an extension of the way i

761
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,639
uh of of how to teach programming is it

762
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,239
is but by

763
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,440
by telling a story

764
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,359
as part of the program so it's uh it

765
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,000
works as a program but it's also

766
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:56,639
readable by humans

767
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,960
yes and especially by me

768
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,200
yeah a week later or a year later that's

769
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,880
a good test if you yourself understand

770
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,319
the code yeah

771
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,200
easily a week or more or a year later

772
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:09,678
yeah

773
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,120
so it it it's uh

774
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,798
what's this piece it's the greatest

775
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,000
thing since sliced bread

776
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:17,759
programming

777
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,798
or literate literate program okay

778
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,278
uh

779
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,599
you heard it here first okay you uh

780
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:24,720
dodged this question in an interview i

781
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,678
listened to

782
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,240
uh so let me ask you again here

783
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:32,480
uh what makes for a beautiful program

784
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,399
what makes for a beautiful program yeah

785
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,640
what are the characteristics you see

786
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,239
like you just said literate programming

787
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,120
what are the characteristics you see in

788
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,278
a program that make you sit back and say

789
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,199
that's pretty good

790
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:46,960
well the reason i didn't answer is

791
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,798
because there are there are dozens and

792
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,079
dozens of answers to that because

793
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,558
because

794
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:54,960
each you can define beauty

795
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:56,639
the same personal defined beauty a

796
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,159
different way from hour to hour i mean

797
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,919
it depends on what

798
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,080
and what you're looking for

799
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,159
at one level you it's it's beautiful

800
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,879
just if it works at all

801
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,159
another level it's beautiful if it's

802
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,360
if it uh

803
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,640
uh

804
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:12,959
uh

805
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,559
it can be understood easily

806
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,558
it's beautiful if it

807
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,360
if it's illiterate programming it's

808
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:23,599
beautiful it makes you laugh i mean

809
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:25,519
yeah i'm actually so i'm with you i

810
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:27,199
think beauty

811
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,519
if it's readable

812
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,640
readable yeah if you understand what's

813
00:28:29,519 --> 00:28:36,158
going on and also understand

814
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,038
the elegance of thought behind it

815
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,320
and then

816
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:42,319
also as you said wit and humor i was

817
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,918
always uh i remember having this

818
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:46,558
conversation i had this conversation on

819
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,000
stack overflow

820
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:52,240
whether humor is good in comments

821
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,240
and i think it is whether huma is good

822
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,399
in comments like uh when you add

823
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,640
comments in code yeah

824
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,000
i always thought a little bit of humor

825
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,240
is good

826
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,038
it shows personality

827
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,960
it shows character shows wit and fun and

828
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:08,798
all those kinds of things

829
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,840
of the personality of the programmers

830
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:14,798
yeah okay so

831
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:16,480
uh a couple days ago i received

832
00:29:14,798 --> 00:29:18,879
a wonderful present from my former

833
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,000
editor at aston wesley he

834
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,720
he's downsizing his house and he found

835
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,519
uh

836
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,640
that

837
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:28,960
somebody at the company had

838
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,320
had found all that all of their internal

839
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,720
files about the art of computer

840
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,079
programming from the 1960s and they gave

841
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,839
it to him

842
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,678
uh and then

843
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:38,720
you know before throwing string in the

844
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,038
garbage

845
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,798
and then so he said oh yeah he

846
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:45,519
he planned to keep it for posterity but

847
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,359
now he realized that posterity is a

848
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:49,359
bit too much for him to handle so he

849
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:50,479
sent it to me

850
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:52,959
and so

851
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,759
and so i just received uh

852
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,840
this big big stack of

853
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,519
of letters uh

854
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:02,000
some of which i had written to them but

855
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,319
but many of which they had written to

856
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:06,000
early guinea pigs who were

857
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:07,119
telling them whether they should publish

858
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,558
or not you know

859
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:09,759
and one of the things

860
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:10,720
was uh

861
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,679
uh

862
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,200
in in the uh in the comments to volume

863
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,559
one uh

864
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,120
uh

865
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:20,798
the the major the major reader was was

866
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:22,639
bob floyd

867
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:24,319
uh

868
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,919
who is my great

869
00:30:24,319 --> 00:30:30,798
uh co-worker in the 60s um died early

870
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,559
unfortunately but but uh

871
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,839
and and he

872
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:35,839
he commented about the humor

873
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:39,759
so we had you know he ran it by me you

874
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,360
know says

875
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:43,599
you know keep this joke in or not you

876
00:30:41,359 --> 00:30:46,479
know um

877
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:48,879
they also sent it out to focus groups

878
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,480
what do you think about humor in

879
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,799
a book about computer programming what's

880
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,880
the conclusion and i stated my

881
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:55,839
philosophy is it said you know the ideal

882
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,360
thing

883
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,319
is uh

884
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:02,479
that it's it's it's something where

885
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,319
the reader knows that there's probably a

886
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,480
joke here if you only understood it and

887
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:08,480
this is a motivation

888
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,038
to understand

889
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,000
to think about it a little bit um but

890
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:16,720
anyway it it it's a very delicate humor

891
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,480
i mean it's it's it's really uh

892
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,079
each each century invents a different

893
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,360
kind of humor too i mean

894
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,199
and

895
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:25,678
different cultures have different

896
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,440
different kinds of humor um yeah like uh

897
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,840
we met we talked about russia a little

898
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,120
bit offline uh you know there's dark

899
00:31:29,839 --> 00:31:32,398
humor

900
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:33,599
and

901
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:34,879
you know what

902
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,480
when a country goes to something

903
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:38,320
different right any of that life and

904
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,599
stuff like this

905
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,599
yo and jack benny i mean

906
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,000
steve allen wrote this book about

907
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:49,278
humor and it was the most boring book

908
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,398
but he was one of my idols but

909
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:51,359
but uh

910
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:52,959
yeah

911
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:55,278
it's called the funny men or something

912
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,360
like that but yeah okay so anyway i i

913
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,079
think it's important to know that

914
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,479
that this is part of life and and it

915
00:32:00,079 --> 00:32:04,158
should be fun and not yeah and and so

916
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,120
you know i wrote this

917
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,000
this organ composition which uh uh is

918
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:12,319
based on the bible but i didn't refrain

919
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,119
from putting little jokes in it

920
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:18,158
also in the music it's hidden in the

921
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:20,719
music it's it's it's there yeah

922
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:22,640
a little humor is okay yeah i mean

923
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,640
not egregious humor

924
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:26,320
so in in this correspondence you know

925
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,960
there were

926
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,558
there were things i said yeah i really

927
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,000
shouldn't have i i really shouldn't have

928
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:34,398
done that

929
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,558
but uh but other ones i could you know i

930
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:37,839
insisted on and i've got

931
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:39,200
jokes in there

932
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:41,599
that no that

933
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,200
nobody has figured out you in fact

934
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,639
in volume 2

935
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,319
i've got a

936
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,600
cryptogram a message

937
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,839
in cypher

938
00:32:47,599 --> 00:32:51,519
and in order to decipher it you're going

939
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:54,398
to have to

940
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,200
have to break an rsa key which is

941
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:58,398
larger than people know how to break

942
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,840
uh and so

943
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,239
you know if computers keep getting

944
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:04,000
faster and faster then you know might be

945
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,159
100 years but somebody will figure out

946
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,519
what this message is and they will laugh

947
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,919
i mean i've got a joke in there

948
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:14,000
so that one you really have to work for

949
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,840
uh i i don't know if you've heard about

950
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,079
this

951
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:19,278
let me explain it maybe you'll find it

952
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:22,398
interesting

953
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:25,038
so open ai is a company that

954
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:27,359
does uh ai work and they have this

955
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,200
language model it's a neural network

956
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,599
that can generate

957
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,200
language pretty well

958
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:35,278
but they also

959
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,319
of on top of that develop something

960
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:38,640
called

961
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,558
openai codex

962
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:43,679
and together with github they developed

963
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:46,480
a system called openai copilot

964
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,559
let me explain what it does

965
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,599
there's echoes of literate programming

966
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:53,038
in it

967
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:55,599
so what you do is you start writing code

968
00:33:53,038 --> 00:33:58,079
and it completes the code for you

969
00:33:55,599 --> 00:34:00,398
so for example you start let's go to

970
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:03,038
your factoring program you start you

971
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:04,479
write in javascript and python in any

972
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,839
language

973
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,760
that it trained on uh you start

974
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,398
you write the first line and some

975
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,720
comments like what this code does and it

976
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:17,759
generates the function for you

977
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,319
and it does an incredibly good job like

978
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,480
it's not provably right but it often

979
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,480
does a really good job of completing the

980
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,079
code for you i see whether

981
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,440
but how do you know whether it did a

982
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:29,119
good job or not

983
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,039
you could see a lot of examples where he

984
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,000
did a good job

985
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:36,480
and so you it it's not a thing that

986
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,719
generates the code for you it starts

987
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,199
it gives you uh

988
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,719
so it puts the human in the seat of

989
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,678
fixing

990
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,439
issues versus writing from scratch do

991
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,559
you find that kind of idea at all

992
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,159
interesting

993
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,440
every year we're going to be losing more

994
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,480
and more

995
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,878
control over what machines are doing and

996
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,920
people are saying well it seemed to like

997
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:03,440
when i was a professor at caltech

998
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,599
uh in this in the 60s we had this

999
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:08,400
this guy who

1000
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,000
who talked a good game

1001
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,720
he could give inspiring lectures and

1002
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,719
you'd think well

1003
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:17,519
certainly things he was talking about an

1004
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,559
hour later you said well what did he say

1005
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,838
um

1006
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:21,759
but what but

1007
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:23,279
but he really felt that it didn't matter

1008
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,560
whether computers got the right answer

1009
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,160
or not it just mattered whether it made

1010
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:27,599
you happy or not in other words if you

1011
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:30,559
you know if

1012
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,400
if if your boss paid for it uh he

1013
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:34,159
you know then you had a job you could

1014
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,358
you know you could

1015
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:38,000
you could take care of your wife

1016
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:39,838
happiness is more important than truth

1017
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,838
exactly he didn't believe in truth but

1018
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:42,838
he was a philosopher

1019
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:47,119
i like

1020
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:49,440
it and somehow you you see uh

1021
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,599
we're going that way i mean

1022
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,440
so many more things are are taken over

1023
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,440
by saying well this seems to work

1024
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,280
and so and when there's

1025
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,880
when there is uh competing interests

1026
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:04,240
involved neither side understands

1027
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,240
why the decision is being made

1028
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:10,000
you know we realize now that it's that

1029
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:13,358
is bad but but consider what happens

1030
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,280
five private ten year year down the line

1031
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,279
when things get even more

1032
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,920
further detached and each thing is based

1033
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,800
on

1034
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,200
something

1035
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,920
from the previous year yeah so you start

1036
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:26,480
to lose the more you automate the more

1037
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,159
you start to lose track of uh some deep

1038
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,039
experimentally

1039
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:34,719
exponentially but so that's the dark

1040
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:37,039
side the positive side is

1041
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:39,679
the more you automate the more you let

1042
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:40,400
humans do what humans do best

1043
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,239
so

1044
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,240
maybe programming

1045
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:46,159
this you know maybe

1046
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,639
humans should focus on a small part of

1047
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:51,199
programming that requires that genius

1048
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,118
the magic of the human mind

1049
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:56,159
and the mess you let the machine

1050
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:57,440
generate yeah i mean they're that's the

1051
00:36:56,159 --> 00:36:59,920
that's the positive but of course it

1052
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,358
does come with the darkness like

1053
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,280
automation

1054
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:06,078
what what's better correct i'm never

1055
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:08,079
going to try to write a book about that

1056
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,440
uh i'm never going to recommend to any

1057
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,440
of my students to work for them

1058
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,759
so you you're on the side of i'm on the

1059
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,240
side i'm on the side of honor happiness

1060
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,320
understanding i understand

1061
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,639
and i i think these things are really

1062
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:24,880
marvelous if they if

1063
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,319
if what they do is you know

1064
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,280
all of a sudden we have a better medical

1065
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,119
diagnosis or or or you know it will help

1066
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,280
guide some scientific experiment or

1067
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,280
something like this uh

1068
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,839
you know you know curing diseases or

1069
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,200
what whatever but

1070
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,719
but when it

1071
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:43,519
when it affects people's lives in a

1072
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:44,879
serious way uh uh

1073
00:37:43,519 --> 00:37:47,358
so if you're writing if you're writing

1074
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,800
code for geeky oh yeah here this is

1075
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:52,078
great

1076
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,560
this will make a slaughter bot okay

1077
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:57,119
so i see so

1078
00:37:54,559 --> 00:37:58,880
you have to be very careful

1079
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:00,960
like right now it seems like fun and

1080
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,440
games it's useful to write a little

1081
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,800
javascript program that helps you with

1082
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,440
the website

1083
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,000
but like you said one year passes two

1084
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:12,320
years passes five years and you forget

1085
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,679
you start building on top of it and then

1086
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,440
all of a sudden you have autonomous

1087
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,639
weapon systems

1088
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,119
based

1089
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:21,358
well we're all dead it doesn't matter in

1090
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,440
that sense

1091
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:26,880
well in the end

1092
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,960
the this whole thing ends anyway so

1093
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,400
um but it it

1094
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,800
there is a heat death of the universe

1095
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,838
predicted but i i'm trying to postpone

1096
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,160
that for

1097
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,719
for a little bit

1098
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,399
well it'd be nice that at the end

1099
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:43,919
as we approach the heat death of the

1100
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,160
universe there's

1101
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,880
still some kind of consciousness there

1102
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:49,679
to

1103
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,000
to to to appreciate it

1104
00:38:49,679 --> 00:38:53,759
hopefully human consciousness i'll

1105
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,400
settle for 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the

1106
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,599
10th year some finite number but

1107
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,280
but

1108
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,119
things like this might be the reason we

1109
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,200
don't pick up any

1110
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,800
signals from

1111
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:06,799
extraterrestrial

1112
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,119
they don't want anything to do with us

1113
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:13,160
oh because they because they

1114
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:13,160
they invented it too and

1115
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,559
so you you do have a little bit of worry

1116
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,960
on the

1117
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:23,119
existential threats of

1118
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,519
ai and automation

1119
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,960
so like like removing the human from the

1120
00:39:25,519 --> 00:39:30,480
picture et cetera yeah people have more

1121
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,079
more potential to

1122
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,159
to do harm now than

1123
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:39,440
by far than they did a 100 years ago

1124
00:39:36,159 --> 00:39:41,759
but are you optimistic about so the

1125
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,519
humans are good at creating destructive

1126
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,200
things but also humans are good at

1127
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,119
solving problems yeah i mean there's

1128
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,559
half empty and have full you know that

1129
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:51,358
so

1130
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,838
how yeah we have full or what i can go

1131
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:55,199
yeah so so let me let me put it this way

1132
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:56,719
because

1133
00:39:55,199 --> 00:39:58,559
because it's the only way i can be

1134
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:00,078
optimistic but but

1135
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:02,719
but

1136
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,960
think of um

1137
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,959
of

1138
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:09,199
things that have changed because of

1139
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,838
civilization

1140
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,199
you know they don't occur just in nature

1141
00:40:11,838 --> 00:40:15,519
so just

1142
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,118
uh just imagine that the room we're in

1143
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:18,318
for example

1144
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,519
okay some

1145
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:21,519
you know we've got

1146
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:23,519
pencils we've got books we've got tables

1147
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,440
we've got microphones

1148
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:27,838
clothing food

1149
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:31,679
all these things were added

1150
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:33,519
somebody invented them one by one and

1151
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:36,239
millions of things

1152
00:40:33,519 --> 00:40:37,599
uh that we inherit okay

1153
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,078
and

1154
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:41,838
it's inconceivable that that so many

1155
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,039
millions of billions of things uh

1156
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:45,039
wouldn't have problems and

1157
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,760
we we get it all right

1158
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,839
um and and each one

1159
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,720
would have no

1160
00:40:50,838 --> 00:40:56,000
negative

1161
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:59,279
effects and so on so it it's very

1162
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,480
amazing that it much works as does work

1163
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,960
it's

1164
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,880
it's incredibly amazing

1165
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,880
and actually that's the source of my

1166
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,519
optimism as well

1167
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,880
including for artificial intelligence

1168
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:13,358
so

1169
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,160
we we drive over bridges

1170
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,239
we we use all kinds of technology we

1171
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:20,078
don't know how it works and there's

1172
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:22,399
millions of brilliant people involved in

1173
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,160
building a small part of that and it

1174
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,280
doesn't go wrong and it works and i mean

1175
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:27,039
that

1176
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,680
it it works

1177
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:32,838
and it doesn't go go wrong

1178
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:35,358
often enough to suffer and we can

1179
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:37,119
identify things that aren't working and

1180
00:41:35,358 --> 00:41:38,480
and try to

1181
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,358
improve on them

1182
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,358
in a sub often suboptimal way oh

1183
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:45,279
absolutely but it's

1184
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:47,039
but but the

1185
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,560
the kind of things that

1186
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,679
i know how to

1187
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:51,679
improve

1188
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,919
require human beings to be rational and

1189
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:56,000
i i'm losing my confidence that human

1190
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,960
beings are rational

1191
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,639
yeah

1192
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,559
yeah now here you go again with the

1193
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:06,639
worst case uh worst case analysis

1194
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:08,078
they may not be rational but they're um

1195
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:10,318
they're they're

1196
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,000
clever and uh

1197
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,838
beautiful in their own kind of way yeah

1198
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,159
i tend to think that most people

1199
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:19,838
um have the desire and the capacity to

1200
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:22,879
be good to each other

1201
00:42:19,838 --> 00:42:24,799
and love will ultimately win out like if

1202
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:26,800
they're given the opportunity that's

1203
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,640
where they lean

1204
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,720
in the art of computer programming you

1205
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:33,279
wrote the real problem is that

1206
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,279
programmers have spent far too much time

1207
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,760
worrying about efficiency in the wrong

1208
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,880
places and at the wrong times

1209
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:42,400
premature optimization is the root of

1210
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,039
all evil

1211
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,480
in parentheses or at least most of it in

1212
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:49,599
programming

1213
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,159
can you uh explain this idea

1214
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,680
uh what's the wrong time what is the

1215
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:58,719
wrong place for our optimization so

1216
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:02,639
first of all the word optimization i i

1217
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:05,118
started out writing software uh and

1218
00:43:02,639 --> 00:43:09,039
optimization was i was a compiler writer

1219
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,240
so optimization meant uh making the

1220
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:12,559
uh

1221
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,959
making a better translation it it so

1222
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:17,039
that it would run faster on it on a

1223
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,960
machine instead of an optimized program

1224
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:21,358
it's just like you know you you you run

1225
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,679
a program and you set the optimization

1226
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,440
level uh for

1227
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:27,199
the compiler so that's one

1228
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,679
word for optimization

1229
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,118
um and at that time i

1230
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:33,598
i happened to be looking in an

1231
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:35,838
unabridged dictionary

1232
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,599
uh for some reason or other and i came

1233
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:39,759
to work optimizing

1234
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:44,079
what's the meaning of the word optimized

1235
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:44,079
and it says to view with optimism

1236
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:50,318
and you look in webster's dictionary of

1237
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:54,480
english language in 1960 early 1960s

1238
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:54,480
that's what optimized me meant okay

1239
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,800
so people

1240
00:43:56,639 --> 00:44:00,960
started doing cost optimization other

1241
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,359
kinds of things uh

1242
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,039
you know whole subfields of

1243
00:44:03,358 --> 00:44:07,679
of

1244
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,039
algorithms and economics and whatever

1245
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,118
are are based on what they call

1246
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,159
optimization now but

1247
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:14,720
but

1248
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:15,598
to me optimization when i was saying

1249
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,799
that

1250
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:20,160
was saying uh uh changing a program to

1251
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,680
make it more

1252
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,199
tuned to the machine

1253
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:28,480
and i found out that uh

1254
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:29,759
when a person writes a program

1255
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,559
uh

1256
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,680
he

1257
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:33,119
he or she

1258
00:44:31,679 --> 00:44:35,039
tends to think that

1259
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,720
the parts that were hardest to write are

1260
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:38,960
going to be hardest for the computer to

1261
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,639
execute

1262
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,720
so

1263
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:46,000
maybe i have 10 pages of code but

1264
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:48,719
i i had to work a week writing this page

1265
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,239
i i mentally think that when the

1266
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:51,519
computer gets to that page it's going to

1267
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,519
slow down

1268
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:55,358
right uh it's chris oh i don't

1269
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:58,559
understand what i'm doing i better

1270
00:44:55,358 --> 00:45:00,719
be more anyway this is of course

1271
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:01,679
silly but it's it's something that we

1272
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:03,759
that we

1273
00:45:01,679 --> 00:45:05,519
that we don't know when we write a piece

1274
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,920
of code we don't know what

1275
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:09,440
what whether the computer is actually

1276
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,559
going to be executing that code very

1277
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,119
much

1278
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:15,358
so so people had had a very

1279
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,240
poor understanding of

1280
00:45:15,358 --> 00:45:18,719
of

1281
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:21,039
what the computer was actually doing

1282
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:24,399
i i made one test where

1283
00:45:21,039 --> 00:45:26,559
where we studied a fortran compiler

1284
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,090
and it was spending more than 80 of its

1285
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:30,480
time reading the comments card

1286
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:32,240
[Music]

1287
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:34,400
but as a programmer we were really

1288
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,399
concerned about how fast it could take a

1289
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,720
complicated expression that had lots of

1290
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,280
levels of parenthesis and

1291
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:43,598
and and and convert that in

1292
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,800
into something but that was just you

1293
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:49,039
know less than one percent of the uh

1294
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:50,480
so if we optimized that

1295
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,838
uh

1296
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,358
we didn't know what we were doing but

1297
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:54,639
but but if if we knew that it was

1298
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:55,759
spending eighty percent of his time on

1299
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:57,759
the comments

1300
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,760
card you know in ten minutes we could we

1301
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,839
could make the the compiler run more

1302
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:03,920
than twice as fast and you can only do

1303
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:05,920
that once you've completed the program

1304
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,400
and then you empirically study where i

1305
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:11,119
had some kind of profiling that i knew

1306
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,960
what was important yeah so

1307
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,480
you don't think the supplies generally i

1308
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,318
mean there's something that rings true

1309
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,159
to this across the board i'm glad that

1310
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,159
it applied generally but but it was it

1311
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:22,879
was only my good luck

1312
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:25,279
i said it but you know but but i did but

1313
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:27,119
i said it in limited context and not and

1314
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,200
and i'm glad if it

1315
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,240
makes people think about stuff because i

1316
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,199
i

1317
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:32,799
but

1318
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:36,078
it applies

1319
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,200
in another sense too that is

1320
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,200
sometimes i will

1321
00:46:39,358 --> 00:46:43,440
do optimization in a way that does help

1322
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:45,519
the

1323
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:48,480
the actual running time

1324
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:50,800
but makes the program impossible to

1325
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:52,480
change next week

1326
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,760
because i've changed my data structure

1327
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,639
of something that

1328
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:58,560
that made it less adaptable so one of

1329
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:01,199
the great uh

1330
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,078
principles of computer science is

1331
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:04,000
is

1332
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,800
it is laziness or whatever you call it

1333
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,760
the

1334
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,720
late binding uh you know don't

1335
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,599
hold off decisions when you can

1336
00:47:10,719 --> 00:47:12,559
um

1337
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,640
and

1338
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:19,519
and and you know and we understand now

1339
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:21,598
quantitatively how valuable that is

1340
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,679
what do you mean we understand so you

1341
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:25,440
mean people

1342
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:28,159
people have written thesis about how you

1343
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:30,639
can how late binding will

1344
00:47:28,159 --> 00:47:33,440
it will improve the i mean you know just

1345
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:36,078
in time manufacturing or whatever

1346
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,838
you can make you can defer a decision

1347
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,760
instead of doing your advanced planning

1348
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,838
and say i'm gonna allocate thirty

1349
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,440
percent to this and fifty percent so in

1350
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,000
all kinds of domains there's an

1351
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:48,240
optimality to laziness in many cases

1352
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:50,639
decision is not made in advance so

1353
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:53,279
instead you you design

1354
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:55,440
in order to be flexible uh uh to to

1355
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:57,040
change with the uh uh

1356
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:00,159
with the way the wind is blowing yeah

1357
00:47:57,039 --> 00:48:01,838
but so the reason that line resonated

1358
00:48:00,159 --> 00:48:03,519
with a lot of people

1359
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,639
is because

1360
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:06,559
uh there's something about the

1361
00:48:04,639 --> 00:48:09,759
programmer's mind

1362
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,760
that wants that enjoys optimization so

1363
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:12,880
it's a constant struggle

1364
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,920
to

1365
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,200
balance

1366
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,599
laziness

1367
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:20,558
and lay binding with

1368
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:24,079
the desire to optimize

1369
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,440
the elegance of a well-optimized code is

1370
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,480
something that's compelling to

1371
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,440
programming

1372
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,800
yeah

1373
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,519
it's a

1374
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,599
another concept of beauty

1375
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:36,960
let me ask you a weird question

1376
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:40,880
so roger penrose

1377
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,639
has talked about computation computers

1378
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,039
and

1379
00:48:42,639 --> 00:48:46,879
he proposed that

1380
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,358
the way the human mind discovers

1381
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,800
mathematical ideas is something more

1382
00:48:49,358 --> 00:48:53,279
than a computer

1383
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,599
that that a universal turing machine

1384
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:58,160
cannot

1385
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,079
do everything that a human mind can do

1386
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,039
now this includes

1387
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,318
discovering mathematical ideas and it

1388
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:05,599
also includes

1389
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:06,880
he's written a book about it

1390
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,039
consciousness

1391
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,240
so i don't know if you know roger but

1392
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,558
yeah

1393
00:49:10,239 --> 00:49:14,399
my uh my daughter's kids played with his

1394
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,359
kids in oxford

1395
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,480
nice

1396
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:21,199
so do you think there is such a limit to

1397
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:23,280
the computer do you think consciousness

1398
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:26,558
is more than a computation do you think

1399
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,880
the human mind the way it thinks is more

1400
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:31,519
than a computation

1401
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:35,280
i i mean like i i can say yes or no but

1402
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,079
but but i don't i have no reason

1403
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,920
i mean

1404
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:40,318
so you don't find it useful to have an

1405
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,240
intuition in one way or the other like

1406
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:45,279
when you think about algorithms do you

1407
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:47,919
isn't it

1408
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,519
unanswerable question in my opinion is

1409
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:51,519
is no better than anybody else you think

1410
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:52,800
it's unanswerable so you don't think

1411
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:54,559
eventually science

1412
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,920
angels can dance on the head i mean i

1413
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,400
don't know

1414
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,318
but angels

1415
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,720
anyway there are lots of things that are

1416
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:03,599
beyond that that we can speculate about

1417
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:05,039
but

1418
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,680
i don't want somebody to say oh yeah

1419
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:10,558
canoe said this and and so he's he's

1420
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:13,919
he's smart and so he so that must be

1421
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:16,079
i mean i say it's something that uh

1422
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:17,119
we'll never know

1423
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,318
interesting

1424
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,000
okay that's a strong statement i i don't

1425
00:50:20,318 --> 00:50:24,079
i personally think it's something we

1426
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:27,119
will know eventually like there's no

1427
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,800
reason to me why the the workings of the

1428
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:31,599
human mind

1429
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,200
are not within the reach of science

1430
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:34,800
that's absolutely possible and i'm not

1431
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:36,558
denying it yeah

1432
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:38,640
uh but right now you don't have a good

1433
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,960
intuition i mean that's also possible

1434
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:43,440
you know that and ai

1435
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,880
you know created the universe you know

1436
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,440
intelligent design

1437
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,920
has all been done by an ai yes

1438
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,639
this is i mean all these things are but

1439
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,880
but but but you're asking me to

1440
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:58,078
to pronounce on it and and i don't have

1441
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,480
any expertise i i i i'm a teacher that

1442
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:02,240
passes on knowledge but i don't

1443
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,519
but i don't know

1444
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:06,479
the fact that i

1445
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:09,280
that i vote yes or no on

1446
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,760
well you do have expertise as a human

1447
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,480
not as a not as a teacher

1448
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,800
or a scholar of computer science

1449
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:18,639
i mean that's ultimately the realm of

1450
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,480
where the discussion of human thought

1451
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:22,480
yeah well i know we're in consciousness

1452
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,119
he might even thought he proved it but

1453
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:33,039
no he doesn't he doesn't prove it he is

1454
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:35,680
following intuition but

1455
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:38,000
but i mean you have to ask john mccarthy

1456
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:39,118
john mccarthy

1457
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,440
i think

1458
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,680
uh we're totally unimpressed by these

1459
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,599
statements

1460
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:48,000
so you don't think so even like the

1461
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,079
touring paper on

1462
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,119
uh on the touring test

1463
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:53,280
that

1464
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:56,079
you know starts by asking can machines

1465
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,519
think oh um you don't think these kind

1466
00:51:56,079 --> 00:52:00,720
of um

1467
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:02,800
touring doesn't like that question yeah

1468
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:04,558
i don't consider it important let's put

1469
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,720
it that way

1470
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,160
because it it's in the category of

1471
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,318
things that

1472
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:12,000
it it it would be nice you know but i

1473
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:13,519
think it's beyond knowledge and so i

1474
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:16,800
don't

1475
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:17,679
i'm not i'm more interested in knowing

1476
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,318
about

1477
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:22,159
the riemann hypothesis or something

1478
00:52:20,318 --> 00:52:24,318
so when you say it's an interesting

1479
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:26,558
statement beyond knowledge

1480
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:29,279
yeah i think what you mean

1481
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,200
is it's not sufficiently well

1482
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,440
it's not even known well enough to be

1483
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:36,399
able to formalize it

1484
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,838
in order to ask a clear question yeah

1485
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,000
and so that's why it's beyond knowledge

1486
00:52:37,838 --> 00:52:42,159
but that doesn't mean it's not

1487
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:43,920
eventually going to be formalized yeah

1488
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,558
yeah maybe consciousness will be

1489
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,159
understood some some day but uh the last

1490
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,280
time i checked

1491
00:52:48,159 --> 00:52:52,879
uh

1492
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:54,559
it it was still 200 years away

1493
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,720
i haven't been specializing in this by

1494
00:52:54,559 --> 00:52:59,119
any means but but but i went to lectures

1495
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:01,519
about it 20 years ago when i was

1496
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:04,318
uh there was there was a symposium at

1497
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:07,519
the american academy in in cambridge and

1498
00:53:04,318 --> 00:53:08,800
it started out by saying essentially

1499
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:10,400
everything that's been written about

1500
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,960
consciousness is

1501
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:15,838
is hogwash

1502
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,838
i tend to

1503
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:20,000
i tend to disagree with that a little

1504
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:22,160
bit so well it's

1505
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,199
so consciousness for the longest time

1506
00:53:22,159 --> 00:53:24,960
still

1507
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:27,199
is in the realm of philosophy so it's

1508
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,960
just conversations without any basis and

1509
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,078
yeah understanding

1510
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:31,280
still

1511
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:33,359
i think

1512
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,599
once you start creating artificial

1513
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:38,078
intelligence systems that interact with

1514
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,079
humans

1515
00:53:38,318 --> 00:53:43,759
and they have personality

1516
00:53:40,639 --> 00:53:46,000
they have identity you start flirting

1517
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,240
with the question of consciousness not

1518
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:50,318
from a philosophical perspective but

1519
00:53:48,239 --> 00:53:52,719
from an engineering perspective

1520
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:54,960
and then starts becoming much more

1521
00:53:52,719 --> 00:53:56,480
like i feel like yeah yeah don't

1522
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,880
misunderstand me i

1523
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:00,880
i i i i certainly don't disagree with

1524
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,599
that at all um

1525
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,680
and

1526
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,599
even at these lectures that we had

1527
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:06,960
you know 20 years ago there were

1528
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,559
neurologists

1529
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:11,679
pointing out that

1530
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:13,280
that human beings had actually decided

1531
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:16,159
to do something before they were

1532
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:17,359
conscious of making that decision yeah

1533
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,920
uh

1534
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:21,519
i mean they could tell that

1535
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:24,079
you know that signals were being sent to

1536
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:25,519
their arms before they before their they

1537
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:27,039
knew that they were

1538
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:29,039
anything like this

1539
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:31,920
are true and and uh

1540
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,000
my uh you know less valiant has

1541
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,519
an architecture for the brain and more

1542
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,239
recently uh

1543
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:39,199
uh

1544
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:41,118
christus papadomitrio uh

1545
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:43,759
in the academy

1546
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:45,280
science proceedings a year ago uh with

1547
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,040
with two other people but i know chris

1548
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,000
does very well

1549
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:52,480
uh and and he's got this uh

1550
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,920
uh this model of uh

1551
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,798
this architecture

1552
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:58,720
by which you could uh create a

1553
00:54:56,798 --> 00:55:00,880
uh things that

1554
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:02,078
that correlate well with the uh with

1555
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:04,318
experiments that are done on

1556
00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:07,039
consciousness uh

1557
00:55:04,318 --> 00:55:09,039
and and and and he

1558
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:12,719
he actually you know has a

1559
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,920
a machine language that in which you can

1560
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:15,759
you can write

1561
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,760
code and

1562
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:19,119
and test hypotheses

1563
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:21,680
uh

1564
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:23,599
and so it it might you know we might

1565
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:25,118
have a big breakthrough my personal

1566
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:26,240
feeling is that

1567
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,079
consciousness

1568
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,598
the the best model

1569
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,480
i

1570
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:35,440
i've heard of uh to explain the the

1571
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,280
miracle of consciousness uh is

1572
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,798
that that

1573
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,640
that somehow

1574
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:42,159
inside of our

1575
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:43,759
brains

1576
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:45,199
we're having a

1577
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,000
a

1578
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:49,358
continual survival for the fittest

1579
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:51,039
competition

1580
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:53,358
as i'm speaking to you

1581
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:54,880
uh all the possible things i might be

1582
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:56,159
wanting to say

1583
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,000
are all in there

1584
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,440
and there's like a voting going on yeah

1585
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,440
right and

1586
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:04,880
one of them is is winning

1587
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:07,358
and and that's affecting the you know

1588
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:08,480
the next sentence and so on yeah uh and

1589
00:56:07,358 --> 00:56:10,480
uh

1590
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,880
there was this book

1591
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,838
machine intelligence or unintelligent on

1592
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:17,760
intelligence yeah bill

1593
00:56:14,838 --> 00:56:19,920
atkinson uh was what was it what was a

1594
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,960
total

1595
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:25,200
devotee of that book well i like

1596
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,519
whether it's consciousness or something

1597
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:31,838
else i like the storytelling part that

1598
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:34,639
we it feels like uh for us

1599
00:56:31,838 --> 00:56:36,558
humans it feels like there's a concrete

1600
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:38,078
it's almost like literary programming i

1601
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:39,519
don't know what the programming going on

1602
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:40,960
on the inside but i'm getting a nice

1603
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:43,519
story here about

1604
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,199
what happened and it feels like i'm in

1605
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,759
control and i'm getting a nice clear

1606
00:56:45,199 --> 00:56:49,598
story so but it's also possible there's

1607
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:51,200
a computation going on

1608
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,119
that's really messy there's a bunch of

1609
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:55,118
different competing ideas

1610
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:57,519
and in the end it just kind of generates

1611
00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:00,079
a story for you to uh

1612
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:04,000
a consistent story for you to believe

1613
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:05,440
and that makes it all nice yeah and so

1614
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,480
i prefer to talk about things that i

1615
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:10,838
have some expertise and then things for

1616
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,639
which i which i'm only a

1617
00:57:10,838 --> 00:57:14,558
uh you know

1618
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:16,719
on the sideline

1619
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:18,798
so there's a tricky thing i don't know

1620
00:57:16,719 --> 00:57:20,078
if you have any expertise in this you

1621
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:21,838
might be a little bit on the sideline

1622
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:23,440
it'd be interesting to ask though

1623
00:57:21,838 --> 00:57:25,679
what are your thoughts on cellular

1624
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:27,280
automata and the game of life

1625
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:30,078
have you ever played with those kind of

1626
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:32,400
little uh games i think uh the game of

1627
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:35,039
life uh it is

1628
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:36,960
it is wonderful and uh

1629
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:37,599
uh

1630
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,358
and

1631
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:42,480
and shows all kind of stuff about how

1632
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,719
things

1633
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,240
can evolve without the creator

1634
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:47,598
understanding

1635
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,118
anything more than

1636
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:51,599
the power of

1637
00:57:49,119 --> 00:57:53,119
learning things in a way but to me the

1638
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,960
most

1639
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:58,079
important thing about the game of life

1640
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:00,400
is that is is how it

1641
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:02,559
focused for me

1642
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,798
what what it meant to have free will or

1643
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,798
not

1644
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:11,519
because the game of life is obviously

1645
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:13,039
totally deterministic yes and i i i find

1646
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:14,559
it hard to believe that anybody who's

1647
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:16,719
ever had children

1648
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,280
cannot believe in free will

1649
00:58:16,719 --> 00:58:22,480
right on the other hand

1650
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:25,440
this makes it crystal clear

1651
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:25,440
john conway said

1652
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,838
he wondered whether it was

1653
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:33,759
immoral to shut the computer off after

1654
00:58:31,838 --> 00:58:37,838
he got into a particularly interesting

1655
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:39,520
play of the game of life um wow yeah so

1656
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:41,759
there is

1657
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:43,759
to me the reason i love the game of life

1658
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,160
is exactly as you said a clear

1659
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:48,160
illustration that from

1660
00:58:46,159 --> 00:58:50,399
simple initial conditions with simple

1661
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:52,000
rules you know exactly

1662
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,358
how the system is operating is

1663
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,559
deterministic

1664
00:58:53,358 --> 00:58:58,639
and yet if you let yourself

1665
00:58:56,559 --> 00:59:01,760
if if you allow yourself to

1666
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:05,199
lose that knowledge a little bit

1667
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:07,119
enough to see the bigger organisms

1668
00:59:05,199 --> 00:59:09,439
that emerge and then all of a sudden

1669
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:11,760
they seem conscious they seem

1670
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,159
not conscious but living if if the

1671
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,240
universe is finite

1672
00:59:14,159 --> 00:59:18,239
we're all living in the game of life to

1673
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:21,118
slow down i mean

1674
00:59:18,239 --> 00:59:23,679
it's sped up a lot

1675
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,160
but do you think technically

1676
00:59:23,679 --> 00:59:28,719
some of the ideas that you used for

1677
00:59:26,159 --> 00:59:30,639
analysis of algorithms can be used to

1678
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:32,558
analyze the game of life

1679
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:34,798
can we make sense of it or is it too

1680
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,880
weird yeah i mean i i

1681
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:38,400
i've got i've got a dozen exercises in

1682
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,519
volume

1683
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,838
for

1684
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:42,798
fascicle six uh

1685
00:59:41,838 --> 00:59:44,239
that

1686
00:59:42,798 --> 00:59:46,159
actually worked rather well for that

1687
00:59:44,239 --> 00:59:46,879
purpose

1688
00:59:46,159 --> 00:59:48,719
but

1689
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,318
bill gospers

1690
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:53,039
came up with the

1691
00:59:50,318 --> 00:59:55,039
with the algorithm that that allows

1692
00:59:53,039 --> 00:59:56,239
that allowed golly to

1693
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:57,920
uh to

1694
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:00,558
you know to run thousands and thousands

1695
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,200
of times faster to

1696
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:05,760
you know the website called golly

1697
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:08,318
g-o-l-l-y it simulates the cellular

1698
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:10,480
automata like game of life yeah you got

1699
01:00:08,318 --> 01:00:12,639
you got to check it out yeah

1700
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:16,639
can i ask about john conway

1701
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:18,558
yes in fact i i i'm just reading now the

1702
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:21,279
the issue of mathematical intelligence

1703
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:23,839
or that came in last last week it's a

1704
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,720
whole issue devoted to to

1705
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:26,000
uh

1706
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:30,480
you know

1707
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,280
remembrance of of him did you know him

1708
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:33,599
i

1709
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:35,680
i slept overnight in his house several

1710
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,798
times i

1711
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:43,279
yeah he recently passed away

1712
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:44,400
yeah he got he died a year ago

1713
01:00:43,280 --> 01:00:48,160
may

1714
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,160
i think it was i've covered

1715
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:54,078
what are you what are some memories of

1716
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:54,838
him of his work that stand out for you

1717
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:56,480
is

1718
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:59,199
did uh

1719
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:02,079
on a technical level did any of his work

1720
01:00:59,199 --> 01:01:06,239
inspire you on a personal level that

1721
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:07,839
did he himself inspire you in some way

1722
01:01:06,239 --> 01:01:08,879
you know absolutely to all of those

1723
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:10,639
things but

1724
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:13,160
let's see when did i first meet him i

1725
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:15,679
guess i first met him at oxford in like

1726
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:18,318
1967 when i was wow

1727
01:01:15,679 --> 01:01:19,679
okay that's a long time ago yeah yeah

1728
01:01:18,318 --> 01:01:21,279
you were minus

1729
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:22,719
20 years old or something i don't know

1730
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:24,640
1967.

1731
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:27,279
but but uh

1732
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:28,480
there was a conference where

1733
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,400
uh

1734
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:32,559
and i think i spoke

1735
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,760
i was speaking about

1736
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:35,680
something that

1737
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,799
known as the canoes bendix algorithm now

1738
01:01:35,679 --> 01:01:40,318
but but he

1739
01:01:36,798 --> 01:01:43,119
he gave it famous talk about knots

1740
01:01:40,318 --> 01:01:44,798
and and at the end i didn't know at the

1741
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,760
time but but

1742
01:01:44,798 --> 01:01:49,199
anyway that talk had now

1743
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,319
the source of thousands and thousands of

1744
01:01:49,199 --> 01:01:51,439
papers

1745
01:01:50,318 --> 01:01:52,639
since then

1746
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,639
uh and

1747
01:01:52,639 --> 01:01:55,679
it was he was reported on something that

1748
01:01:54,639 --> 01:01:58,798
he had done

1749
01:01:55,679 --> 01:02:00,889
in high school uh

1750
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:02,159
you know almost ten years earlier

1751
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:03,679
[Music]

1752
01:02:02,159 --> 01:02:06,239
before this conference but he never

1753
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:08,399
published it and and he climaxed his

1754
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:10,959
stock by

1755
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:12,880
building some nozzle

1756
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,240
you have these lit these little plastic

1757
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,200
things that you that you could stick

1758
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:17,519
together

1759
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:21,038
uh it's it's it's

1760
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:23,358
it's something like lego but easier

1761
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:24,880
and so he made a whole bunch of knots in

1762
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:26,639
front of the audience and so on and then

1763
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,079
disassembled it

1764
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:30,798
so it was

1765
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,400
a dramatic lecture

1766
01:02:30,798 --> 01:02:34,480
before he had learned how to give even

1767
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:35,358
more dramatic lectures later

1768
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,559
so

1769
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:38,639
all right and

1770
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:40,798
were you at that lecture and i was there

1771
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:42,078
yeah because i had to i was at the same

1772
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,280
conference

1773
01:02:42,079 --> 01:02:45,599
um

1774
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:47,519
for some reason i was i i happened to be

1775
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,559
in in calgary

1776
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:50,239
uh

1777
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,720
at the same day that he was visiting

1778
01:02:50,239 --> 01:02:52,719
calgary

1779
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:57,280
and it was a spring of of 72

1780
01:02:55,838 --> 01:02:58,239
i'm pretty sure

1781
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:00,640
and

1782
01:02:58,239 --> 01:03:01,358
and we had lunch together

1783
01:03:00,639 --> 01:03:03,358
and

1784
01:03:01,358 --> 01:03:04,880
he wrote down during the lunch on a

1785
01:03:03,358 --> 01:03:06,558
napkin

1786
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,240
uh all of the

1787
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:10,480
facts about

1788
01:03:08,239 --> 01:03:12,159
what he called numbers

1789
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:13,519
um and i

1790
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:15,920
and

1791
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:17,038
and he covered the napkin with with the

1792
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,680
theorems

1793
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:19,680
about his

1794
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,640
his idea of numbers

1795
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,920
and i thought which was incredibly

1796
01:03:24,639 --> 01:03:26,719
beautiful

1797
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,920
um

1798
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:30,318
and

1799
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:32,159
and later in 1972

1800
01:03:30,318 --> 01:03:33,440
my sabbatical year began and i went to

1801
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:34,239
norway

1802
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,240
and

1803
01:03:34,239 --> 01:03:39,118
and in december of that year

1804
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:40,719
uh in the middle of the night

1805
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:43,440
the thought came to me

1806
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:45,439
you know conway's theory about numbers

1807
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:48,240
would be a great

1808
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:50,000
thing to teach students how to invent

1809
01:03:48,239 --> 01:03:51,598
research and what the joys are of

1810
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,719
research

1811
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:55,280
and

1812
01:03:52,719 --> 01:03:56,879
and i and so i said

1813
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:59,200
and i had also

1814
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:01,920
read a book in dialogue

1815
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:02,798
by by alfred rennie

1816
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,720
uh

1817
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:06,880
where he was kind of a socratic thing

1818
01:04:04,719 --> 01:04:09,838
where the two characters were talking to

1819
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,440
each other about mathematics and so i

1820
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:12,480
and so

1821
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,480
at the end

1822
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,798
in the morning i i

1823
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:17,599
woke up my wife and said

1824
01:04:16,798 --> 01:04:19,679
jill

1825
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:21,838
i think i want to write a book about

1826
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:22,960
conway's theory

1827
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,199
and

1828
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,559
um

1829
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,000
you know

1830
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:29,599
you know i'm supposed to be writing the

1831
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:31,199
art of computer programming doing all

1832
01:04:29,599 --> 01:04:31,920
this other stuff but i got

1833
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:34,159
but

1834
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,039
i really want to write this other book

1835
01:04:34,159 --> 01:04:37,519
and

1836
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:39,039
so we made this plan

1837
01:04:37,519 --> 01:04:40,400
but i said i thought i could write it in

1838
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,760
a week

1839
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,880
and

1840
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:47,039
we made the plan then so in january

1841
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,760
i i rented a room in a hotel in downtown

1842
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:50,720
austin we were in sabbatical in norway

1843
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:52,880
uh

1844
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:55,358
and i ran at the hotel in in downtown

1845
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,960
oslo and um

1846
01:04:55,358 --> 01:04:58,078
did nothing else

1847
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,880
except write

1848
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:03,200
up conway's theory and and i i changed

1849
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:06,160
the name to surreal numbers that so this

1850
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:09,279
book is now published as surreal number

1851
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:10,879
and um and

1852
01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:12,559
you know we figured out we'd always

1853
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:14,880
wonder what what what would he like to

1854
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:16,240
have an affair in a hotel room so so we

1855
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,880
figured out that she would visit me

1856
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:20,639
twice during the week

1857
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,599
things like this you know we would

1858
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,480
you know

1859
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:26,400
try to sneak in this was hotel was was

1860
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,480
run by a mission organization these

1861
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:31,358
ladies were

1862
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:34,880
probably very strict but anyway so yeah

1863
01:05:31,358 --> 01:05:36,719
so uh and the wild week

1864
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,039
in every way but the thing is i had lost

1865
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:41,919
that i had lost that napkin in which you

1866
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:43,520
wrote the theory but but i i

1867
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,280
i looked for it but i couldn't find it

1868
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:47,599
so i

1869
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:50,960
tried to recreate from memory what he

1870
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:54,318
told me at that luncheon uh in calgary

1871
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,240
and and as i as i wrote the book i i was

1872
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:57,759
going through exactly what i what the

1873
01:05:56,239 --> 01:06:00,318
characters in the book were supposed to

1874
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,000
be doing so i start with the

1875
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:04,239
with the two axioms that start out the

1876
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,000
whole thing and everything is defined it

1877
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:06,959
flows from that but you have to discover

1878
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,599
why

1879
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,920
and and as a every mistake that i make

1880
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:14,880
as i'm trying to discover it i uh my

1881
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:17,358
characters make two right you know and

1882
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:19,200
and and so it was it's a long long story

1883
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:20,480
and i but but i worked through this week

1884
01:06:19,199 --> 01:06:22,798
uh

1885
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:25,280
uh and and it and it was

1886
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:28,000
it it was one of the most exciting

1887
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:30,000
intense weeks of my life and and

1888
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:32,798
and i

1889
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:34,318
i described it in other places but but

1890
01:06:32,798 --> 01:06:36,400
but anyway uh

1891
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,960
after six days i i finished it and on

1892
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:42,079
the seventh day i rested and

1893
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,519
and i sent the right to my secretary to

1894
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:46,160
type it

1895
01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:49,519
it was flowing as i was writing it uh

1896
01:06:46,159 --> 01:06:52,798
faster than i could think almost

1897
01:06:49,519 --> 01:06:54,239
but but but after i finished it uh

1898
01:06:52,798 --> 01:06:55,358
and tried to write a letter to my

1899
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:56,639
secretary

1900
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:58,558
telling her how to type it i couldn't

1901
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:00,480
write it anymore

1902
01:06:58,559 --> 01:07:02,000
he gave it the muse had left me

1903
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,000
completely

1904
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:05,838
can you explain how that week could have

1905
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:08,318
happened like why is that seems like

1906
01:07:05,838 --> 01:07:09,838
such a magical week i have no idea but

1907
01:07:08,318 --> 01:07:13,038
anyway there was some

1908
01:07:09,838 --> 01:07:14,400
it it was almost as if i was channeling

1909
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,520
so so

1910
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:17,599
the book

1911
01:07:15,519 --> 01:07:19,838
was typed they sent it to conway

1912
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:23,519
and and he said well don you got the

1913
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:23,519
axiom the one axiom wrong

1914
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:27,519
there is a difference between

1915
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:29,920
um

1916
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:31,440
less than or equal and not greater than

1917
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:34,400
i don't know

1918
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:36,960
the opposite of being greater than yeah

1919
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:38,480
and less than or equal but anyway

1920
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,400
technically it can make a difference

1921
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:43,119
when you're developing a

1922
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:44,400
logical theory and the way i had chosen

1923
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:46,720
was harder

1924
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,920
to do than john's original

1925
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:51,118
so um and we visited him at his house in

1926
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,880
cambridge

1927
01:07:51,119 --> 01:07:53,838
in april we took a boat actually from

1928
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:56,640
norway

1929
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:59,038
over to across the channel and and so on

1930
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:01,440
and stayed with him for some days and

1931
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:03,839
and uh oh he told he talked

1932
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,798
we talked about all kinds of

1933
01:08:03,838 --> 01:08:08,480
uh of of things he has

1934
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:10,480
he had

1935
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,159
puzzles that i'd never heard of before

1936
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:14,719
he had a great way to

1937
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:15,838
to solve the game of solitaire

1938
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:17,519
many of the

1939
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:19,519
common interests that we you know he'd

1940
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,880
never written up and

1941
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:23,759
but but anyway

1942
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:26,079
uh then in the summer time i took

1943
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:28,479
another week off and went to a

1944
01:08:26,079 --> 01:08:30,559
a place in in in

1945
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,599
the mountains of norway and and rewrote

1946
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:33,839
the book

1947
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,679
using the correct axiom

1948
01:08:33,838 --> 01:08:37,198
and so so that was the most intensive

1949
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:40,560
connection with

1950
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:42,559
with conway uh after that uh it started

1951
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:43,839
with a napkin it started with an app

1952
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,000
connect

1953
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:47,439
but but but we would

1954
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,439
run into each other

1955
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:51,678
all that well yeah

1956
01:08:49,439 --> 01:08:54,719
the next really impo

1957
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:56,079
i was giving lectures in montreal

1958
01:08:54,719 --> 01:09:00,399
uh

1959
01:08:56,079 --> 01:09:02,318
i i was giving a series of um

1960
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:04,158
of of seven lectures about the topic

1961
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:05,440
called stable marriages

1962
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:08,798
and

1963
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:09,919
and and he arrived in montreal uh

1964
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:12,399
uh

1965
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:14,480
between my sixth and seventh lecture

1966
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,798
and and we met at a party

1967
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:18,879
and uh i i

1968
01:09:16,798 --> 01:09:21,759
started telling him about the topic i

1969
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:23,759
was doing and uh he sat and thought

1970
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,719
about it he came up with a beautiful

1971
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:27,198
theory

1972
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:29,279
to show that the uh i mean in technical

1973
01:09:27,198 --> 01:09:31,678
terms it's it's that the

1974
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:33,679
that the set of all stable marriages it

1975
01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:35,600
forms a lattice

1976
01:09:33,679 --> 01:09:37,199
and and there was a simple way to find

1977
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,039
the greatest lower bound

1978
01:09:37,198 --> 01:09:40,238
of of two stable

1979
01:09:39,039 --> 01:09:41,759
pairings and

1980
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:43,519
and least upper bound of two stable

1981
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:45,920
married and so i could use it in my

1982
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:49,120
lecture the next day and he came up with

1983
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,480
this theorem you know during the party

1984
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:51,759
uh and it it

1985
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:54,079
it's a brilliant yeah it's a

1986
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:55,920
distributive lesson i mean it

1987
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:59,039
it's uh you know

1988
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:01,520
uh it it added greatly to the theory of

1989
01:09:59,039 --> 01:10:03,840
of stable matching

1990
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:06,159
so you mentioned your wife jill

1991
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,679
you mentioned stable marriage

1992
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:08,799
can you tell the story of how you two

1993
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:11,119
met

1994
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,920
so we celebrated 60 years of wedded

1995
01:10:11,119 --> 01:10:14,079
bliss

1996
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:17,119
uh last month

1997
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:19,279
and and we met because uh uh i was

1998
01:10:17,119 --> 01:10:21,679
dating her roommate

1999
01:10:19,279 --> 01:10:23,759
this this was my sophomore year her

2000
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,359
freshman year i i was dating her

2001
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,480
roommate and

2002
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:28,238
i wanted

2003
01:10:26,479 --> 01:10:30,319
her advice on

2004
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:31,599
strategy or something like this and

2005
01:10:30,319 --> 01:10:34,880
anyway i

2006
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:36,960
found i enjoyed her advice better than

2007
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:39,679
i enjoyed a roommate

2008
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,760
you guys were majoring the same thing no

2009
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,800
no no because because i read something

2010
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:46,239
about

2011
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:47,440
working on a computer in grad school

2012
01:10:46,238 --> 01:10:50,000
on a difficult

2013
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:53,198
computer science topic

2014
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,560
so so she's an artist and i'm okay

2015
01:10:53,198 --> 01:10:56,238
and i'm a

2016
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:58,800
you know geek and what was she doing

2017
01:10:56,238 --> 01:11:01,119
with a computer science book all right i

2018
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,119
read the was it the manual that she was

2019
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:05,760
reading what was she reading i wrote the

2020
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:08,238
manual that she had had she had to take

2021
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:11,119
a class in computer science okay

2022
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:14,079
and and uh you're the tutor no no yeah

2023
01:11:11,119 --> 01:11:17,840
no we yeah we

2024
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:18,640
there were tearful times uh

2025
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:21,199
you know

2026
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:23,679
trying to learn certain concepts but i

2027
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:26,158
learned art from her

2028
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:28,079
and so we we worked together

2029
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,359
you know occasionally in design

2030
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:32,238
projects but

2031
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:35,439
but every year we write a christmas card

2032
01:11:32,238 --> 01:11:37,119
and and we each have to

2033
01:11:35,439 --> 01:11:38,399
compromise our

2034
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:40,399
our own

2035
01:11:38,399 --> 01:11:42,399
notions of beauty yes

2036
01:11:40,399 --> 01:11:44,960
uh when did you

2037
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,719
fall in love with her

2038
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:49,920
that day that i

2039
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:51,359
asked her about her her roommate

2040
01:11:49,920 --> 01:11:52,800
okay i mean

2041
01:11:51,359 --> 01:11:54,880
no i i

2042
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:57,279
okay so

2043
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:59,119
i i don't mind telling these things

2044
01:11:57,279 --> 01:11:59,359
depending on how you for how far you go

2045
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:02,158
but

2046
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:05,279
[Laughter]

2047
01:12:02,158 --> 01:12:07,039
but let me promise

2048
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:09,279
let me tell you this that i

2049
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:11,359
i never really enjoyed kissing

2050
01:12:09,279 --> 01:12:12,559
uh

2051
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:15,599
until i

2052
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:15,600
found how she did it

2053
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:22,718
and 60 years yeah

2054
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:25,279
is there a secret you can uh you can say

2055
01:12:22,719 --> 01:12:27,359
in terms of stable marriages of how you

2056
01:12:25,279 --> 01:12:29,359
stayed together so long

2057
01:12:27,359 --> 01:12:30,319
the topic stable marriage by the way is

2058
01:12:29,359 --> 01:12:31,679
not

2059
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:34,559
it is

2060
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,960
is the technical term uh yes

2061
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,960
it's

2062
01:12:38,979 --> 01:12:42,718
[Music]

2063
01:12:40,079 --> 01:12:44,640
different people will have to

2064
01:12:42,719 --> 01:12:45,840
learn how to compromise and

2065
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:48,000
and and

2066
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,360
work together and and

2067
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,039
and you're going to have ups and downs

2068
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:53,519
and and

2069
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:55,840
and crises and so on um

2070
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:58,080
and so as long as you don't

2071
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:02,000
set your expectation on

2072
01:12:58,079 --> 01:13:02,000
having 24 hours of bliss

2073
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:05,920
then there's a lot of hope for stability

2074
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:07,679
but if you if

2075
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:09,279
if you decide that it's

2076
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:10,779
that that there's going to be no

2077
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:13,279
frustration

2078
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:15,198
[Music]

2079
01:13:13,279 --> 01:13:17,039
so you're going to have to compromise on

2080
01:13:15,198 --> 01:13:19,678
your notions of beauty when you write

2081
01:13:17,039 --> 01:13:21,039
christmas cards that's it

2082
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,039
uh

2083
01:13:21,039 --> 01:13:25,600
you uh you mentioned that richard

2084
01:13:23,039 --> 01:13:28,319
feynman was someone you looked up to

2085
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:29,840
yep um probably you've met him in

2086
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:32,559
caltech

2087
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:35,360
well we knew each other

2088
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,039
yeah at cal tech for sure yeah

2089
01:13:35,359 --> 01:13:39,198
uh you are

2090
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:42,079
one of the seminal personalities

2091
01:13:39,198 --> 01:13:43,359
of computer science he's one for physics

2092
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:45,600
have you ever

2093
01:13:43,359 --> 01:13:46,880
is there specific things you picked up

2094
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,520
from him

2095
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:51,199
by way of inspiration or uh

2096
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:53,120
so we used to go to each other's

2097
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:54,639
lectures and

2098
01:13:53,119 --> 01:13:56,719
and uh

2099
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:58,400
but but if i saw him sitting in the

2100
01:13:56,719 --> 01:14:00,800
front row

2101
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:04,639
i would throw me for a loop actually and

2102
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:06,239
i i i would i would miss a few

2103
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:08,320
a few sentences

2104
01:14:06,238 --> 01:14:10,000
what unique story do i have about i mean

2105
01:14:08,319 --> 01:14:13,599
i

2106
01:14:10,000 --> 01:14:16,399
i i i often refer to his

2107
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:18,480
his time in brazil

2108
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:19,920
where he uh

2109
01:14:18,479 --> 01:14:21,359
essentially

2110
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,279
said they were teaching all the physics

2111
01:14:21,359 --> 01:14:24,479
students the wrong way they were just

2112
01:14:23,279 --> 01:14:26,800
they were just learning how to pass

2113
01:14:24,479 --> 01:14:28,639
exams and not learning any physics

2114
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:31,119
and he said

2115
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:32,159
you know if you want me to prove it

2116
01:14:31,119 --> 01:14:33,519
you know

2117
01:14:32,158 --> 01:14:35,519
here i'll turn to any page of this

2118
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:36,719
textbook and

2119
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:38,880
i'll tell you what's wrong with this

2120
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:40,480
page and and he did so and

2121
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:44,400
and the textbook had been written by his

2122
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:46,399
host and and it was a big embarrassing

2123
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:48,158
incident but he had previously asked his

2124
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:49,439
host if if he was supposed to tell the

2125
01:14:48,158 --> 01:14:50,399
truth

2126
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:52,079
um

2127
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:54,639
but but anyway it

2128
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:57,840
epitomizes the way

2129
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,800
education goes wrong uh in all kinds of

2130
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:01,279
fields

2131
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,320
uh and has to periodically

2132
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:04,000
be brought

2133
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:06,000
back

2134
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:08,319
from from

2135
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:10,719
from a process of giving credentials to

2136
01:15:08,319 --> 01:15:12,319
a process of giving knowledge

2137
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:15,520
that's probably a story that continues

2138
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:18,559
to this day in a bunch of places where

2139
01:15:15,520 --> 01:15:18,560
it's too easy for

2140
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:25,360
educational institutions to fall into

2141
01:15:22,319 --> 01:15:27,840
credentialism versus uh

2142
01:15:25,359 --> 01:15:29,759
inspirationalism

2143
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:32,800
i don't know if those are words but

2144
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:35,600
sort of uh yeah understanding versus

2145
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,199
just giving a little um

2146
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,239
it would be plaque

2147
01:15:37,198 --> 01:15:41,678
and you know it's it's very much like

2148
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:43,919
what we were talking about if you want

2149
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,359
the computer to

2150
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,399
if you want to be able to believe the

2151
01:15:45,359 --> 01:15:49,599
answer computer is sure it's doing that

2152
01:15:48,399 --> 01:15:51,759
one of the things

2153
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,199
bob floyd showed me in the 60s there was

2154
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:56,079
a

2155
01:15:53,198 --> 01:15:57,198
uh he loved this cartoon there was a

2156
01:15:56,079 --> 01:15:59,039
there were two

2157
01:15:57,198 --> 01:16:00,479
guys standing in front of

2158
01:15:59,039 --> 01:16:01,519
in those days the computer was a big

2159
01:16:00,479 --> 01:16:03,039
thing you know

2160
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,159
and and the first guy says to the other

2161
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:05,600
guy he said

2162
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:08,960
this machine

2163
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:11,120
can do in one second what it would take

2164
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,079
uh a million people to do in a hundred

2165
01:16:11,119 --> 01:16:14,000
years

2166
01:16:12,079 --> 01:16:15,319
and the other guy says oh so how do you

2167
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:17,840
know it's right

2168
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:21,599
[Laughter]

2169
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:23,440
that's a good line uh

2170
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:26,159
is there some interesting distinction

2171
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:28,319
between physics and math to you

2172
01:16:26,158 --> 01:16:30,319
have you looked at physics much to like

2173
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:31,599
speak university feynman

2174
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:32,960
so

2175
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:34,800
the difference between the physics

2176
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:36,960
community the physics way of thinking

2177
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,719
the physics intuition versus

2178
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:40,158
the computer science the theoretical

2179
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,439
computer science the mathematical

2180
01:16:40,158 --> 01:16:43,039
sciences

2181
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:45,599
do you see that as a gap are they

2182
01:16:43,039 --> 01:16:46,960
strongly overlapping

2183
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,440
it's quite different

2184
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:52,800
in my opinion i um i started as a

2185
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:54,960
physics major and i switched into math

2186
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:56,480
and

2187
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:58,560
probably the reason was that i could i

2188
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:01,839
could get a plus on the physics exam but

2189
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:03,360
i like i never had any idea why i would

2190
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,880
have been able to

2191
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:06,719
come up with the problems that were on

2192
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,239
those exams

2193
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:11,279
but but in math

2194
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:13,198
i i i knew

2195
01:17:11,279 --> 01:17:14,960
you know why the teacher set those

2196
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:16,799
problems and i thought of other problems

2197
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:18,719
that i could set too

2198
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:21,440
and i believe it's quite a different

2199
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,439
mentality

2200
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:27,520
is it it has to do with your philosophy

2201
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:27,519
of geek geekdom

2202
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,640
i mean

2203
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:32,320
some of my computer scientist friends

2204
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:35,280
are really good at physics and others

2205
01:17:32,319 --> 01:17:37,519
are not and and i i'm

2206
01:17:35,279 --> 01:17:39,840
uh you know i'm really good at algebra

2207
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:40,880
but not at geometry you

2208
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:43,199
talk about different parts of

2209
01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:44,880
mathematics you know i just it's

2210
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:46,719
so they're different kind of physical

2211
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:47,920
but physicists think of things in terms

2212
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:48,800
of waves

2213
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,719
and

2214
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:52,320
i can think of

2215
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,239
things in terms of waves but it's like a

2216
01:17:52,319 --> 01:17:56,880
dog walking on hind legs if i'm thinking

2217
01:17:54,238 --> 01:17:59,599
about it so you basically you like to

2218
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:02,000
see the world in in uh

2219
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,880
in discrete ways and then this is more

2220
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:08,960
continuous yeah i i i'm not sure

2221
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:10,719
if turing would been a great physicist i

2222
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,319
think it was a pretty good

2223
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:14,800
chemist

2224
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:15,920
i don't know but but uh but anyway i see

2225
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:19,679
things

2226
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:21,600
i i i believe that computer science is

2227
01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:25,920
largely

2228
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:27,440
driven by uh a people who have

2229
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:28,960
brains who work

2230
01:18:27,439 --> 01:18:30,479
who are good at

2231
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:32,319
resonating with

2232
01:18:30,479 --> 01:18:34,479
certain kind of

2233
01:18:32,319 --> 01:18:36,559
of of concepts

2234
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:37,839
and like quantum computers it takes a

2235
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,360
different kind of brain yeah that's

2236
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:40,960
interesting yeah

2237
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:43,039
it's it's well quantum computers is

2238
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:44,640
almost like at the intersection in terms

2239
01:18:43,039 --> 01:18:48,000
of brain

2240
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:49,840
uh between computer science and physics

2241
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:53,119
because they it involves both at least

2242
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:55,279
at this at this time

2243
01:18:53,119 --> 01:18:56,158
but there is like the physicists i've

2244
01:18:55,279 --> 01:18:59,198
known

2245
01:18:56,158 --> 01:19:01,359
they have incredibly powerful intuition

2246
01:18:59,198 --> 01:19:04,319
and and there's a lot i mean statistical

2247
01:19:01,359 --> 01:19:06,719
mechanics so i i study

2248
01:19:04,319 --> 01:19:08,479
uh statistical mechanics and

2249
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,279
you know

2250
01:19:08,479 --> 01:19:13,359
i mean random processes uh uh are

2251
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:15,359
related to algorithms in a lot of a lot

2252
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:17,039
of ways and so but there's lots of

2253
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:18,479
different flavors of flavors of physics

2254
01:19:17,039 --> 01:19:20,399
as there are different flavors of

2255
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:23,599
mathematics as well

2256
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:25,119
um but but the thing is that i i don't

2257
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,640
see

2258
01:19:25,119 --> 01:19:29,279
well

2259
01:19:26,640 --> 01:19:30,880
actually when they talk to physicists

2260
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,039
use a completely different language than

2261
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,119
when they're talking to

2262
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:37,119
when they're writing expository papers

2263
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:38,800
so i didn't understand quantum mechanics

2264
01:19:37,119 --> 01:19:40,399
at all from reading about it in

2265
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:42,159
scientific american

2266
01:19:40,399 --> 01:19:43,599
but but when i read

2267
01:19:42,158 --> 01:19:45,519
you know how they described it to each

2268
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:47,120
other talking about eigen eigenvalues

2269
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,040
and

2270
01:19:47,119 --> 01:19:50,559
various mathematical

2271
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:52,399
terms that

2272
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,480
that made sense

2273
01:19:52,399 --> 01:19:57,439
then it made sense to me

2274
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:59,198
but but hawking said that

2275
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:00,719
every formula you put in a book you lose

2276
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:02,238
half of your readers and so he didn't

2277
01:20:00,719 --> 01:20:05,198
put any formulas into the book so i

2278
01:20:02,238 --> 01:20:07,279
couldn't understand his book at all

2279
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:08,879
you could say you understood it but

2280
01:20:07,279 --> 01:20:10,238
i really

2281
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:12,400
i really didn't

2282
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:15,919
um well feynman

2283
01:20:12,399 --> 01:20:17,439
also spoke in this way so feynman

2284
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,119
i think prided himself on a really

2285
01:20:17,439 --> 01:20:22,158
strong intuition but at the same time he

2286
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:24,800
was hiding all the the really good the

2287
01:20:22,158 --> 01:20:27,198
the deep computation he was doing so so

2288
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:30,320
there was one thing that that uh

2289
01:20:27,198 --> 01:20:32,238
that i i was never able to uh yeah i

2290
01:20:30,319 --> 01:20:33,039
wish i had more time to to work out with

2291
01:20:32,238 --> 01:20:34,479
him but

2292
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:36,238
i guess i could describe it for you

2293
01:20:34,479 --> 01:20:38,158
there's

2294
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:39,519
there's something that got my name

2295
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,238
attached to it

2296
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:44,639
called knuth arrow notation but

2297
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:48,718
it's a notation for very large numbers

2298
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:52,560
and so uh it i find out that that

2299
01:20:48,719 --> 01:20:54,960
somebody invented it in in 1830s

2300
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:57,840
it's fairly easy to

2301
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,639
to understand anyway so you start with

2302
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:01,279
x

2303
01:20:58,639 --> 01:21:02,639
plus x plus x plus x

2304
01:21:01,279 --> 01:21:06,800
n times

2305
01:21:02,639 --> 01:21:09,199
and and you can call that x n

2306
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:10,480
so x n is multiplication then you take x

2307
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:12,839
times x

2308
01:21:10,479 --> 01:21:17,599
times x times x and n time that gives

2309
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:20,239
you exponentiation x to the nth power

2310
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,800
so that's one arrow x

2311
01:21:20,238 --> 01:21:23,519
so x n with no arrows is multiplication

2312
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:26,639
x

2313
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:28,960
arrow n is x to the nth power yes just

2314
01:21:26,639 --> 01:21:30,000
to clarify for the

2315
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:33,119
uh

2316
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,359
so x times x times x n times is

2317
01:21:33,119 --> 01:21:36,399
obviously x n

2318
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:39,279
and x

2319
01:21:36,399 --> 01:21:42,238
x plus x plus x n times

2320
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:45,759
oh yeah okay and then uh xn

2321
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:47,839
multiplication is x to the n uh and then

2322
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:49,440
and then here the arrow is when you're

2323
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:52,000
doing the same kind of repetitive

2324
01:21:49,439 --> 01:21:54,158
operation for the exponential so i so i

2325
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,719
put in one arrow and i get x to the nth

2326
01:21:54,158 --> 01:21:59,039
power now i put in two arrows and that

2327
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:00,079
makes takes x to the x to the x to the x

2328
01:21:59,039 --> 01:22:01,760
to the x

2329
01:22:00,079 --> 01:22:03,920
n times pi

2330
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:05,600
so in other words if

2331
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:06,319
if if it's two

2332
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:07,760
uh

2333
01:22:06,319 --> 01:22:10,719
double arrow

2334
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:13,280
uh three that would be

2335
01:22:10,719 --> 01:22:14,719
that would be 2 to the 2 to the 2

2336
01:22:13,279 --> 01:22:18,319
so that would be 2 to the fourth power

2337
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:19,600
that'd be 16 okay okay so so so that's

2338
01:22:18,319 --> 01:22:21,198
the double arrow

2339
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:22,079
and now you can

2340
01:22:21,198 --> 01:22:23,599
do a

2341
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:26,479
triple arrow

2342
01:22:23,600 --> 01:22:28,079
uh of course uh and

2343
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:28,799
and so on

2344
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:32,158
and

2345
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:32,960
and i i had this this paper called

2346
01:22:32,158 --> 01:22:34,079
uh

2347
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,000
well

2348
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,960
essentially big numbers

2349
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:38,560
uh

2350
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:40,158
you know you yeah you try to impress

2351
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:42,560
your friend but by saying a number

2352
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:43,519
they've never thought of before yeah and

2353
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:45,840
and

2354
01:22:43,520 --> 01:22:46,719
and i i gave a special name

2355
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,520
for it

2356
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:49,920
we

2357
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:53,040
designed a font for it that has script k

2358
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,880
and so on but it but it really is 10

2359
01:22:53,039 --> 01:22:57,760
i think like 10

2360
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,920
quadruple aero 3 or something like that

2361
01:22:57,760 --> 01:23:01,600
and i claim that that number if it

2362
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,920
is so mind-boggling that you can't

2363
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:05,600
comprehend how large it is

2364
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,520
but anyway fine

2365
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,360
i talked to feynman about this and he

2366
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,000
said oh

2367
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:14,238
let's just let's just use double arrow

2368
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,439
but instead of taking integers let's

2369
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:17,678
consider

2370
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:20,479
complex numbers right so

2371
01:23:17,679 --> 01:23:20,480
you know you have

2372
01:23:22,319 --> 01:23:27,359
that means x to the x

2373
01:23:25,119 --> 01:23:29,639
x but what about x

2374
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:32,960
x double arrow two

2375
01:23:29,639 --> 01:23:35,119
2.5 well that's not too hard to figure

2376
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:36,719
out that's interpolate between those but

2377
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:39,039
what what what

2378
01:23:36,719 --> 01:23:42,158
x double arrow

2379
01:23:39,039 --> 01:23:42,960
i or one plus i or some complex number

2380
01:23:42,158 --> 01:23:44,079
uh

2381
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,279
and

2382
01:23:44,079 --> 01:23:50,158
and uh so he claimed that

2383
01:23:47,279 --> 01:23:51,519
that that there was no analytic

2384
01:23:50,158 --> 01:23:54,638
function that would

2385
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:57,920
that would do that would do the job uh

2386
01:23:54,639 --> 01:24:02,239
but i i i i didn't know how he could

2387
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:04,319
claim that that was that wasn't true

2388
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:06,299
and his next question was did then have

2389
01:24:04,319 --> 01:24:09,439
a complex number of arrows

2390
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:12,400
[Laughter]

2391
01:24:09,439 --> 01:24:14,839
yeah okay wow okay okay so so that's

2392
01:24:12,399 --> 01:24:17,359
that's fine uh that's

2393
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,960
fine can you describe what the

2394
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:19,839
[Music]

2395
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,639
uh

2396
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,800
new morris pratt algorithm does

2397
01:24:22,639 --> 01:24:27,279
and how did you come to develop it one

2398
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:29,840
of the many things that you're known for

2399
01:24:27,279 --> 01:24:31,279
and has your name attached to it yeah

2400
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:34,960
all right so

2401
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:37,039
it should be actually morris pratt knuth

2402
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,198
but we decided to use alphabetical order

2403
01:24:37,039 --> 01:24:40,719
when we published the paper

2404
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:43,279
the problem is

2405
01:24:40,719 --> 01:24:46,158
uh something that everybody knows now if

2406
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:48,079
they're if they're using a search engine

2407
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:49,279
uh

2408
01:24:48,079 --> 01:24:52,079
you have a

2409
01:24:49,279 --> 01:24:53,920
a large collection of text

2410
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:55,198
and you want to know if

2411
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:57,279
if the word

2412
01:24:55,198 --> 01:25:00,079
canoeist appears anywhere in the text to

2413
01:24:57,279 --> 01:25:01,920
say or or some

2414
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:02,960
some other word that's less interesting

2415
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,800
than

2416
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:05,600
but anyway that's the most interesting

2417
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,520
thing

2418
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,239
or something mega morris right

2419
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:13,360
so we have we have

2420
01:25:09,238 --> 01:25:16,319
a large piece of text and it it's all

2421
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:18,000
one long one-dimensional thing you know

2422
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:21,279
first or second letter

2423
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:23,520
et cetera et cetera et cetera and so uh

2424
01:25:21,279 --> 01:25:25,759
the question you would like to be able

2425
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:27,120
to do this

2426
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:29,280
um

2427
01:25:27,119 --> 01:25:31,840
and the obvious way is that let's say

2428
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:34,719
we're looking for morris they don't know

2429
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:36,719
that so we would we would go through and

2430
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:38,719
wait till we get to letter m then we

2431
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:42,239
look at the next word and sure enough

2432
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:43,359
it's an o and then an r but then that oh

2433
01:25:42,238 --> 01:25:44,559
too bad

2434
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:47,759
um

2435
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:50,880
yeah the next letter is is e

2436
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:52,560
so we missed we missed out on morris

2437
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:55,119
and so

2438
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:56,560
we go back and start looking for another

2439
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:58,238
okay all over again so that's the

2440
01:25:56,560 --> 01:25:59,360
obvious way to do it

2441
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:00,238
all right

2442
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:03,119
um

2443
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:05,839
and and jim morris noticed

2444
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:07,198
there was a more clever way

2445
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:09,360
to do it

2446
01:26:07,198 --> 01:26:10,638
the obvious way would have started

2447
01:26:09,359 --> 01:26:12,319
let's say

2448
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:14,400
you know we found that let letter m at

2449
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:16,960
character position one thousand

2450
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:18,579
so it was started next at character

2451
01:26:16,960 --> 01:26:19,840
position 1001

2452
01:26:18,579 --> 01:26:20,719
[Music]

2453
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:23,440
but

2454
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:25,439
but he but he said no look we we already

2455
01:26:23,439 --> 01:26:27,919
read the o and the r

2456
01:26:25,439 --> 01:26:30,638
and we know that they aren't m's

2457
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:33,279
so we could we could start

2458
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:35,199
we don't have to read those over again

2459
01:26:33,279 --> 01:26:37,439
all right so uh

2460
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:40,000
and this gets pretty tricky when

2461
01:26:37,439 --> 01:26:41,039
when the word isn't morris but it's more

2462
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,520
like

2463
01:26:41,039 --> 01:26:45,920
abracadabra where you have patterns that

2464
01:26:43,520 --> 01:26:47,760
are occurring uh

2465
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:49,199
like repeating patterns

2466
01:26:47,760 --> 01:26:52,480
at the beginning at the middle right

2467
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:54,079
right so so um

2468
01:26:52,479 --> 01:26:56,158
he worked it out

2469
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:58,960
and he put it into the system software

2470
01:26:56,158 --> 01:27:01,039
at berkeley i think it was where he was

2471
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:03,679
he was writing some berkeley unix i

2472
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:05,920
think was some routine i was supposed to

2473
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:08,079
find occurrences of patterns in texas

2474
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:08,079
and

2475
01:27:08,158 --> 01:27:10,319
and

2476
01:27:10,479 --> 01:27:14,399
we didn't explain it

2477
01:27:12,238 --> 01:27:16,959
and and so he found out that several

2478
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:18,319
months later somebody had

2479
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:20,480
had looked at it didn't look right and

2480
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:22,238
so they ripped it out

2481
01:27:20,479 --> 01:27:24,399
so he had this this algorithm but it

2482
01:27:22,238 --> 01:27:26,000
didn't make it through

2483
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:27,679
you know because he what wasn't

2484
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:30,399
understood

2485
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:34,399
nobody knew about this particularly

2486
01:27:30,399 --> 01:27:38,319
von pratt also had independently

2487
01:27:34,399 --> 01:27:40,238
discovered it a year or two later

2488
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:41,279
i forget why

2489
01:27:40,238 --> 01:27:43,839
i think

2490
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:44,840
vaughn was studying some

2491
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:46,800
technical

2492
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:48,719
problem

2493
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:51,360
about palindromes or something like that

2494
01:27:48,719 --> 01:27:52,480
he wasn't really it juan wasn't working

2495
01:27:51,359 --> 01:27:55,519
on

2496
01:27:52,479 --> 01:27:57,759
on text searching but he was working on

2497
01:27:55,520 --> 01:28:01,440
on an abstract problem that

2498
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:04,320
that was related well at that time steve

2499
01:28:01,439 --> 01:28:05,439
cook was a professor at berkeley uh

2500
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:06,319
and uh

2501
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:07,439
uh

2502
01:28:06,319 --> 01:28:09,519
it was the

2503
01:28:07,439 --> 01:28:11,519
greatest mistake that

2504
01:28:09,520 --> 01:28:12,880
berkeley cs department made was not to

2505
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:14,639
give him tenure

2506
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:18,239
and so steve went to

2507
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:20,880
went to toronto but um but i but i knew

2508
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:22,959
steve while he was at berkeley

2509
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:25,199
and he had come up with a

2510
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:26,239
with a very peculiar theorem

2511
01:28:25,198 --> 01:28:28,399
uh

2512
01:28:26,238 --> 01:28:30,079
about a technical concept called a stack

2513
01:28:28,399 --> 01:28:32,799
automaton

2514
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:33,920
and a stack automaton it is a machine

2515
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,320
that

2516
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:37,920
that it can't do everything a turing

2517
01:28:36,319 --> 01:28:39,599
machine can do but it

2518
01:28:37,920 --> 01:28:40,800
it can only look at

2519
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:42,880
something on

2520
01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:44,800
at the top of a stack or it can put more

2521
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,319
things on the stack or or it can take

2522
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:49,600
things off the stack

2523
01:28:46,319 --> 01:28:51,920
like it can't remember a long string of

2524
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:54,400
symbols but but it can remember them in

2525
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:56,960
reverse order so so if you tell a stack

2526
01:28:54,399 --> 01:28:56,960
of thomas on

2527
01:28:58,158 --> 01:29:03,359
it can tell you afterwards edcba

2528
01:29:02,158 --> 01:29:04,879
you know it doesn't have any other

2529
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:07,198
memory except

2530
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:09,840
except this one thing that it can see

2531
01:29:07,198 --> 01:29:10,960
and steve cook proved this amazing thing

2532
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:13,920
that says

2533
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,239
if a stack automaton can recognize a

2534
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:17,840
language

2535
01:29:16,238 --> 01:29:18,879
where the strings of the language are

2536
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,560
length n

2537
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:23,039
in any um

2538
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:25,679
amount of time whatsoever so the stack

2539
01:29:23,039 --> 01:29:28,238
automaton you might use a zillion steps

2540
01:29:25,679 --> 01:29:30,880
a regular computer can recognize that

2541
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:33,279
same language in time n log n

2542
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:35,840
so steve had a way of transforming

2543
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:38,238
a a computation that goes on and on and

2544
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:41,199
on and on

2545
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:42,638
into using different data structures

2546
01:29:41,198 --> 01:29:45,759
into something that you can do on a

2547
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:49,199
regular computer uh fast

2548
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:52,079
the stack of timezone goes slow but

2549
01:29:49,198 --> 01:29:53,359
but but but somehow the fact that it can

2550
01:29:52,079 --> 01:29:55,600
do it at all

2551
01:29:53,359 --> 01:29:57,599
means that there has to be a fast way

2552
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:59,760
so i thought this was a pretty

2553
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,000
you know cool theorem

2554
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:03,920
and so i tried it out on

2555
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:05,600
on a problem

2556
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:08,319
where i knew

2557
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:10,400
a stack automaton could do it

2558
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:12,319
but i couldn't figure out a fast way to

2559
01:30:10,399 --> 01:30:14,158
do it on a regular computer i thought i

2560
01:30:12,319 --> 01:30:15,119
was a pretty good programmer

2561
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:16,638
but

2562
01:30:15,119 --> 01:30:18,800
but by golly

2563
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:21,199
i couldn't think of any way to recognize

2564
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,960
this language

2565
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:24,559
efficiently

2566
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:26,079
so i went through steve cook's

2567
01:30:24,560 --> 01:30:27,840
construction

2568
01:30:26,079 --> 01:30:29,439
i filled my blackboard

2569
01:30:27,840 --> 01:30:32,079
with all the

2570
01:30:29,439 --> 01:30:35,039
everything that stack thomas undone

2571
01:30:32,079 --> 01:30:36,479
did you know i i i wrote down and and

2572
01:30:35,039 --> 01:30:38,639
then i tried to

2573
01:30:36,479 --> 01:30:40,079
see patterns in that

2574
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:41,760
and

2575
01:30:40,079 --> 01:30:44,639
and how did he convert that into a

2576
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:46,239
computer program on a regular machine

2577
01:30:44,639 --> 01:30:49,119
um and

2578
01:30:46,238 --> 01:30:50,799
finally i psyched it out

2579
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:52,800
what was what was the thing i was

2580
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:54,480
missing so that i could

2581
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,679
say oh yeah this is what i should do in

2582
01:30:54,479 --> 01:30:56,638
my program

2583
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,639
uh

2584
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,840
and now i have an efficient program

2585
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:04,639
and and so i

2586
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:05,679
uh i i would never have thought about

2587
01:31:04,639 --> 01:31:07,840
like

2588
01:31:05,679 --> 01:31:10,000
that if i hadn't had his theorem which

2589
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:12,000
was purely abstract thing

2590
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:14,000
actually

2591
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:16,158
to try to intuit how to use the stack

2592
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:20,079
automaton for the the string matching

2593
01:31:16,158 --> 01:31:21,519
problem yeah so so so the problem i

2594
01:31:20,079 --> 01:31:23,439
i had

2595
01:31:21,520 --> 01:31:25,040
started with was not the string matching

2596
01:31:23,439 --> 01:31:26,960
part but then i realized that the string

2597
01:31:25,039 --> 01:31:28,238
matching problem was another thing which

2598
01:31:26,960 --> 01:31:30,319
would also be

2599
01:31:28,238 --> 01:31:32,799
could be done by a stack of automatons

2600
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:35,679
and and so when when i looked at what

2601
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,560
that told me then i had a nice algorithm

2602
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:38,960
for this

2603
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:41,280
string matching problem uh

2604
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:43,600
and and it told me

2605
01:31:41,279 --> 01:31:45,599
exactly what i should remember as i'm as

2606
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:47,600
i'm going through the string

2607
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:49,120
and i worked it out and and i wrote this

2608
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:52,239
little paper called

2609
01:31:49,119 --> 01:31:54,238
automata theory can be useful

2610
01:31:52,238 --> 01:31:56,079
and and the reason was that it was first

2611
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:59,039
i mean i had been reading all kinds of

2612
01:31:56,079 --> 01:32:01,439
papers about automated theory

2613
01:31:59,039 --> 01:32:04,319
but it never taught me it never improved

2614
01:32:01,439 --> 01:32:06,238
my programming for for everyday problems

2615
01:32:04,319 --> 01:32:08,238
uh it was something that you published

2616
01:32:06,238 --> 01:32:11,439
in journals and and and you know it was

2617
01:32:08,238 --> 01:32:13,279
it was interesting stuff but it but here

2618
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:15,519
was a case where i couldn't figure out

2619
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:17,679
how to write the program i had a theorem

2620
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:20,800
from automated theory then i knew how to

2621
01:32:17,679 --> 01:32:21,840
write the program so this was

2622
01:32:20,800 --> 01:32:22,960
for me

2623
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:24,880
uh

2624
01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,719
you know a change in life i started to

2625
01:32:24,880 --> 01:32:28,560
say maybe i should

2626
01:32:26,719 --> 01:32:29,439
learn more about thomas

2627
01:32:28,560 --> 01:32:31,920
and

2628
01:32:29,439 --> 01:32:33,759
and and and i i showed this note to

2629
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,560
vaughn pratt and he said

2630
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:37,039
that's

2631
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,600
similar to something i was working on

2632
01:32:37,039 --> 01:32:42,079
um and then uh

2633
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:43,679
and jim morris was at berkeley too at

2634
01:32:42,079 --> 01:32:45,279
the time

2635
01:32:43,679 --> 01:32:47,119
anyway he

2636
01:32:45,279 --> 01:32:48,238
he he's had an illustrious career but i

2637
01:32:47,119 --> 01:32:50,479
haven't kept

2638
01:32:48,238 --> 01:32:51,678
track of jim but one is my colleague at

2639
01:32:50,479 --> 01:32:53,198
stanford

2640
01:32:51,679 --> 01:32:57,039
and my student

2641
01:32:53,198 --> 01:32:59,039
uh later but but this was before vaughn

2642
01:32:57,039 --> 01:33:01,119
ron was still a graduate student and

2643
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:02,399
hadn't come to stanford yet so we found

2644
01:33:01,119 --> 01:33:04,960
out that we'd all been working on the

2645
01:33:02,399 --> 01:33:06,638
same thing so so it was our algorithm we

2646
01:33:04,960 --> 01:33:09,198
each discovered it independently but

2647
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:12,480
each of us had discovered a different

2648
01:33:09,198 --> 01:33:13,919
a different part of the elephant

2649
01:33:12,479 --> 01:33:16,158
you know a different

2650
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:17,039
aspect of it and so we could put our

2651
01:33:16,158 --> 01:33:19,198
our

2652
01:33:17,039 --> 01:33:20,880
our things together it was my job to

2653
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:23,519
write the paper

2654
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:26,159
how did the elephants bring to life

2655
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:28,560
spring to life was because i

2656
01:33:26,158 --> 01:33:30,399
i had drafted this paper

2657
01:33:28,560 --> 01:33:32,800
autonomous theory

2658
01:33:30,399 --> 01:33:35,039
oh it can be useful which was seen by

2659
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,400
vaughn and then by jim and then then

2660
01:33:35,039 --> 01:33:38,800
then we combined

2661
01:33:36,399 --> 01:33:40,158
because maybe they had also

2662
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:44,000
been thinking of writing something up

2663
01:33:40,158 --> 01:33:46,319
about it about specifically history

2664
01:33:44,000 --> 01:33:46,319
problem

2665
01:33:48,479 --> 01:33:53,119
let me ask a ridiculous question

2666
01:33:51,119 --> 01:33:55,439
uh last time we talked you told me what

2667
01:33:53,119 --> 01:33:56,479
the most beautiful algorithm is

2668
01:33:55,439 --> 01:33:59,519
actually

2669
01:33:56,479 --> 01:34:02,399
uh for strongly connected graphs

2670
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:03,440
what is the hardest problem

2671
01:34:02,399 --> 01:34:05,759
puzzle

2672
01:34:03,439 --> 01:34:08,238
idea in computer science for you

2673
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:10,320
personally that you had to work through

2674
01:34:08,238 --> 01:34:12,238
just something that was just the

2675
01:34:10,319 --> 01:34:14,158
hardest thing that i've ever

2676
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:16,718
been involved with yeah

2677
01:34:14,158 --> 01:34:19,039
okay well yeah that's i don't

2678
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:23,600
know how to answer questions like that

2679
01:34:19,039 --> 01:34:23,600
but in this case uh it's pretty clear

2680
01:34:23,679 --> 01:34:27,359
okay because

2681
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:28,479
it's uh

2682
01:34:27,359 --> 01:34:31,198
called the

2683
01:34:28,479 --> 01:34:33,198
the birth of the giant component okay so

2684
01:34:31,198 --> 01:34:34,399
now let me explain that because this is

2685
01:34:33,198 --> 01:34:36,238
actually gets

2686
01:34:34,399 --> 01:34:38,399
gets into physics too

2687
01:34:36,238 --> 01:34:39,919
and it gets into something called bose

2688
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:41,118
einstein statistics

2689
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,480
but but

2690
01:34:41,118 --> 01:34:43,839
but anyway

2691
01:34:42,479 --> 01:34:45,519
it's got

2692
01:34:43,840 --> 01:34:48,800
some interesting stories and it

2693
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,800
connected with berkeley again

2694
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:52,479
so

2695
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:55,039
start with the idea of a random graph

2696
01:34:52,479 --> 01:34:55,039
now this is

2697
01:34:55,439 --> 01:35:00,719
here we we just say we have n points

2698
01:34:58,238 --> 01:35:01,519
that are totally unconnected

2699
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:03,920
and

2700
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:06,159
and there's no geometry involved there's

2701
01:35:03,920 --> 01:35:09,199
no saying some points are further apart

2702
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:11,759
than others all points are exactly

2703
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:14,399
are exactly alike and

2704
01:35:11,760 --> 01:35:16,639
let's say we have 100 points and

2705
01:35:14,399 --> 01:35:17,839
and we number them from zero zero to

2706
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:19,359
nine nine

2707
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:22,159
all right

2708
01:35:19,359 --> 01:35:25,359
now let's let's take pi

2709
01:35:22,158 --> 01:35:30,319
uh the digits of pi so

2710
01:35:25,359 --> 01:35:33,118
two at a time so so we had 31 41 59 26

2711
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:34,799
we we can look go go through pi

2712
01:35:33,118 --> 01:35:37,039
and so

2713
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:39,600
so we take the first two 31

2714
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:42,319
41 and let's

2715
01:35:39,600 --> 01:35:44,880
let's put a connection between point 31

2716
01:35:42,319 --> 01:35:48,158
and point 41

2717
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:49,520
that's an edge in the graph so

2718
01:35:48,158 --> 01:35:51,198
then we take

2719
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,679
5 9 2 6

2720
01:35:51,198 --> 01:35:56,638
and make another edge

2721
01:35:53,679 --> 01:35:57,679
and the graph gets bigger it gets more

2722
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,960
and more

2723
01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,279
connected

2724
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:03,840
as we add these things one at a time

2725
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:06,639
okay so we start out with end points

2726
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,920
and and we add uh

2727
01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:10,960
m edges

2728
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:12,639
okay now each edge is completely

2729
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:14,880
we forgot about

2730
01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:17,359
edges we had before we make an edge

2731
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:19,039
twice we might get an edge from a point

2732
01:36:17,359 --> 01:36:21,679
to its selfie but

2733
01:36:19,039 --> 01:36:24,238
um you know maybe pi is going to

2734
01:36:21,679 --> 01:36:25,840
have a run of four digits in there

2735
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:27,519
so we're gonna

2736
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:30,239
but anyway

2737
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:32,159
we're evolving a graph at random

2738
01:36:30,238 --> 01:36:34,879
um and

2739
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:36,638
a magical thing happens

2740
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:37,679
when the number of edges

2741
01:36:36,639 --> 01:36:40,560
is

2742
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:42,000
like point four nine and

2743
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:44,080
uh

2744
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:45,439
so maybe n is a million

2745
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:46,880
and i have

2746
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:49,439
uh you know

2747
01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:50,239
490 000 edges

2748
01:36:49,439 --> 01:36:51,439
uh

2749
01:36:50,238 --> 01:36:53,599
then

2750
01:36:51,439 --> 01:36:58,399
it almost all the time

2751
01:36:53,600 --> 01:36:58,400
it it consists of isolated trees

2752
01:36:58,560 --> 01:37:03,199
not even any loops right

2753
01:37:01,359 --> 01:37:04,719
it's a very small number of veggies so

2754
01:37:03,198 --> 01:37:07,519
far

2755
01:37:04,719 --> 01:37:10,079
a little less than half n and right but

2756
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:12,000
if i had point five one inches so a

2757
01:37:10,079 --> 01:37:14,719
little more than half in

2758
01:37:12,000 --> 01:37:18,158
so it's you know million points

2759
01:37:14,719 --> 01:37:21,840
510 000 edges

2760
01:37:18,158 --> 01:37:21,839
now it probably has

2761
01:37:22,960 --> 01:37:25,920
a

2762
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:28,399
one component that's much bigger than

2763
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,399
the others

2764
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:34,719
um and we call that the giant component

2765
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:35,439
is that can you clap so can you clarify

2766
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:37,600
so

2767
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:41,198
is there a name for this kind of random

2768
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:43,440
super cool pie random graph

2769
01:37:41,198 --> 01:37:46,238
well i i call it

2770
01:37:43,439 --> 01:37:48,879
part the pie graph no no i

2771
01:37:46,238 --> 01:37:51,519
the pie graph is actually

2772
01:37:48,880 --> 01:37:53,679
my pie graph is based on

2773
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:56,800
on binary representation of pi not the

2774
01:37:53,679 --> 01:37:58,800
decimal representation of pi but but but

2775
01:37:56,800 --> 01:38:01,360
but anyway

2776
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:03,600
let's suppose i was rolling dice instead

2777
01:38:01,359 --> 01:38:05,118
what's that so sorry so it doesn't it

2778
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:07,039
doesn't have to be pi

2779
01:38:05,118 --> 01:38:09,279
any source

2780
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:11,600
the point is every step

2781
01:38:09,279 --> 01:38:12,960
choose totally at random one of those

2782
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:14,960
endpoints

2783
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:17,118
and choose totally at random another one

2784
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:19,279
of the end points

2785
01:38:17,118 --> 01:38:21,439
make that an edge

2786
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:23,279
that's the process yeah

2787
01:38:21,439 --> 01:38:26,238
so there's there's nothing magical about

2788
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:28,559
pi they you're no no i was using pi to

2789
01:38:26,238 --> 01:38:30,799
sort of saying pi is sort of random that

2790
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:33,119
nobody knows a pattern in exactly got it

2791
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:36,000
i got it but it's not

2792
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:38,559
yeah i i could have just as well drawn

2793
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:41,359
straws or something um this was a

2794
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:43,760
concept invented by erdogan rainey and

2795
01:38:41,359 --> 01:38:46,238
they called evolution of random graphs

2796
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:47,280
and if you start out with with a large

2797
01:38:46,238 --> 01:38:49,759
number n

2798
01:38:47,279 --> 01:38:52,158
and you and you repeat this process all

2799
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:54,159
of a sudden a big bang happens at one

2800
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:56,839
half n there'll be two points together

2801
01:38:54,158 --> 01:38:58,479
then maybe we'll have half have

2802
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,279
three uh

2803
01:38:58,479 --> 01:39:00,158
and then

2804
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:01,920
you know

2805
01:39:00,158 --> 01:39:04,000
then they maybe branch out a little bit

2806
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:05,920
but but they'll all be separate until we

2807
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,238
get to one half end

2808
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:10,158
and we pass one half in and all of a

2809
01:39:08,238 --> 01:39:12,079
sudden

2810
01:39:10,158 --> 01:39:14,238
there's substance to it that

2811
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:15,840
there are there's a big

2812
01:39:14,238 --> 01:39:17,519
clump of stuff that's all joined

2813
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:20,719
together so it's almost like a phase

2814
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:22,320
transition of some kind it's exactly it

2815
01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:24,158
it's a phase transition but it's

2816
01:39:22,319 --> 01:39:27,840
actually it's a double phase transition

2817
01:39:24,158 --> 01:39:29,198
and turns out it it it happens

2818
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:30,159
there's actually two things going on at

2819
01:39:29,198 --> 01:39:32,638
once

2820
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:35,599
at this phase transition which

2821
01:39:32,639 --> 01:39:37,760
uh which is very remarkable about okay

2822
01:39:35,600 --> 01:39:39,280
so so um

2823
01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:41,360
a lot of the most important algorithms

2824
01:39:39,279 --> 01:39:43,198
are based on random processes and so i

2825
01:39:41,359 --> 01:39:45,359
wanted to you know i want to understand

2826
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:46,799
random processes now

2827
01:39:45,359 --> 01:39:48,238
so there are data structures that sort

2828
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:49,600
of grow this way

2829
01:39:48,238 --> 01:39:52,158
okay so

2830
01:39:49,600 --> 01:39:54,719
so dick carp one of the leading

2831
01:39:52,158 --> 01:39:56,000
experts on on random randomized

2832
01:39:54,719 --> 01:39:58,079
algorithms

2833
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:59,359
had his students working looking at this

2834
01:39:58,079 --> 01:40:01,519
at berkeley

2835
01:39:59,359 --> 01:40:02,639
and we heard a rumor that the students

2836
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:05,840
had

2837
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:07,118
found something interesting happening

2838
01:40:05,840 --> 01:40:08,639
the students are

2839
01:40:07,118 --> 01:40:11,039
are generating this

2840
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,880
or simulating this random evolution of

2841
01:40:11,039 --> 01:40:16,079
graphs and

2842
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:17,600
under taking stat snapshots

2843
01:40:16,079 --> 01:40:19,600
every so often

2844
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,320
take a look at what the graph is

2845
01:40:19,600 --> 01:40:23,440
and the rumor was that every time they

2846
01:40:22,319 --> 01:40:25,279
looked

2847
01:40:23,439 --> 01:40:27,839
that there was only one component that

2848
01:40:25,279 --> 01:40:29,439
had loops in it almost always they do a

2849
01:40:27,840 --> 01:40:30,480
million experience

2850
01:40:29,439 --> 01:40:31,359
and

2851
01:40:30,479 --> 01:40:33,039
only

2852
01:40:31,359 --> 01:40:37,839
three or four times did they ever ever

2853
01:40:33,039 --> 01:40:37,840
happen to see a loop at at this point

2854
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:43,039
no more than one component with the loop

2855
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:43,840
so they want you to keep till the graph

2856
01:40:43,039 --> 01:40:45,279
gets

2857
01:40:43,840 --> 01:40:46,000
completely full

2858
01:40:45,279 --> 01:40:48,238
uh

2859
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:49,520
so it starts out totally empty and gets

2860
01:40:48,238 --> 01:40:52,399
more and more

2861
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:53,600
more and more edges all the time uh and

2862
01:40:52,399 --> 01:40:55,920
and so okay

2863
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:57,840
certainly a loop comes along once but

2864
01:40:55,920 --> 01:41:01,440
but now all the loops

2865
01:40:57,840 --> 01:41:01,440
stay somehow joined to that one

2866
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:07,600
they're

2867
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:10,400
there never were two guys with loops wow

2868
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:12,320
okay in this experiment okay so anyway

2869
01:41:10,399 --> 01:41:14,479
this one almost always

2870
01:41:12,319 --> 01:41:16,559
certainly not always yeah

2871
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:19,198
but but but with high very high

2872
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:21,600
probability that seemed to be true so

2873
01:41:19,198 --> 01:41:22,719
so we heard about this rumor at stanford

2874
01:41:21,600 --> 01:41:25,760
and we said

2875
01:41:22,719 --> 01:41:27,600
if if that's true then must you know

2876
01:41:25,760 --> 01:41:29,119
a lot more must also be true so there's

2877
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:30,560
a whole bunch there's a whole theory out

2878
01:41:29,118 --> 01:41:32,799
there waiting to be discovered that we

2879
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:34,080
haven't ever thought about so so let's

2880
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,000
take a look at it

2881
01:41:34,079 --> 01:41:38,559
and so we look closer and we find out no

2882
01:41:36,000 --> 01:41:39,359
it actually it's not true

2883
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:42,639
but

2884
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:44,000
but in fact it's almost true

2885
01:41:42,639 --> 01:41:46,239
namely

2886
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,079
there's a very short interval of time

2887
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:49,759
when it's true

2888
01:41:48,079 --> 01:41:50,399
and and if you don't happen to look at

2889
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:52,639
it

2890
01:41:50,399 --> 01:41:54,799
during that short interval of time

2891
01:41:52,639 --> 01:41:55,840
then you miss it

2892
01:41:54,800 --> 01:41:57,920
so

2893
01:41:55,840 --> 01:42:00,960
that in other words there'll be a period

2894
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:02,639
where they're two or three components

2895
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:04,000
have loops

2896
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:07,199
but

2897
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,118
they join together pretty soon okay

2898
01:42:07,198 --> 01:42:11,198
so so

2899
01:42:09,118 --> 01:42:13,599
if you don't have

2900
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:14,399
a real fast shutter speed you're going

2901
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:16,159
to miss

2902
01:42:14,399 --> 01:42:18,319
you're going to miss that instant so

2903
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:20,319
separate loops don't exist for long

2904
01:42:18,319 --> 01:42:22,880
that's that's it yeah you know i started

2905
01:42:20,319 --> 01:42:24,719
looking at this to make it quantitative

2906
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:26,400
and uh

2907
01:42:24,719 --> 01:42:29,039
basic problem was to slow down the big

2908
01:42:26,399 --> 01:42:32,879
bang so that i could watch it happening

2909
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:35,600
yeah i i think i can explain it actually

2910
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:37,520
in fairly elementary terms deep

2911
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:40,480
even without writing a formula that's

2912
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:42,639
right like hawking would do uh and and

2913
01:42:40,479 --> 01:42:45,439
and so uh

2914
01:42:42,639 --> 01:42:48,159
let's let's watch the evolution and and

2915
01:42:45,439 --> 01:42:49,678
at first uh these edges are coming along

2916
01:42:48,158 --> 01:42:51,118
and they're just making

2917
01:42:49,679 --> 01:42:53,679
things without loops

2918
01:42:51,118 --> 01:42:55,920
which we call trees okay so then all of

2919
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:57,920
a sudden the loop first appears so at

2920
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,880
that point i have one component that has

2921
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,639
a loop

2922
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:02,400
all right now

2923
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:04,000
now i say that the complexity of a

2924
01:43:02,399 --> 01:43:06,719
component

2925
01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:08,319
is the number of edges minus the number

2926
01:43:06,719 --> 01:43:11,840
of vertices

2927
01:43:08,319 --> 01:43:15,118
so if i have a loop i have like a loop

2928
01:43:11,840 --> 01:43:17,199
of length five it has five edges and

2929
01:43:15,118 --> 01:43:20,399
five vertices

2930
01:43:17,198 --> 01:43:21,839
um or or i could put a tail on that

2931
01:43:20,399 --> 01:43:25,118
and that would be another edge another

2932
01:43:21,840 --> 01:43:27,199
vertex like a zero one two complexity

2933
01:43:25,118 --> 01:43:29,920
kind of thing so so if the if the

2934
01:43:27,198 --> 01:43:32,559
complexity is zero we have one

2935
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:35,440
one loop i call it a cycle or i call a

2936
01:43:32,560 --> 01:43:36,840
cyclic component so so cyclic component

2937
01:43:35,439 --> 01:43:38,399
looks like

2938
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:40,000
a

2939
01:43:38,399 --> 01:43:41,679
a wheel

2940
01:43:40,000 --> 01:43:43,760
to which you attach

2941
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:45,920
fibers

2942
01:43:43,760 --> 01:43:47,280
or trees

2943
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:48,800
they go branching but there's no more

2944
01:43:47,279 --> 01:43:50,079
loops there's only one loop and

2945
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,880
everything else

2946
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:54,880
feeds into that loop okay and that has

2947
01:43:52,880 --> 01:43:56,719
complexity zero

2948
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:58,880
but but a tree itself has complexity

2949
01:43:56,719 --> 01:44:00,560
minus one because it has

2950
01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:01,359
uh uh you know

2951
01:44:00,560 --> 01:44:03,360
like

2952
01:44:01,359 --> 01:44:05,759
like it might have ten vertices and nine

2953
01:44:03,359 --> 01:44:07,920
edges to tie the time together so nine

2954
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:09,679
minus ten is minus one so

2955
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:12,000
so complexity

2956
01:44:09,679 --> 01:44:13,679
minus one is a tree

2957
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:14,800
it's gotta be connected that's what i

2958
01:44:13,679 --> 01:44:17,279
mean by a component it's gotta be

2959
01:44:14,800 --> 01:44:19,440
connected so so so if if i have ten

2960
01:44:17,279 --> 01:44:21,359
things connected i have to have nine

2961
01:44:19,439 --> 01:44:22,879
edges

2962
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:26,399
can you clarify

2963
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:28,880
why when complexity goes uh you can go

2964
01:44:26,399 --> 01:44:30,319
above zero i'm a little yes

2965
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:32,239
right so

2966
01:44:30,319 --> 01:44:33,279
the complexity plus one is the number of

2967
01:44:32,238 --> 01:44:36,879
loops

2968
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:39,359
so if complexity is zero i have one loop

2969
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:41,279
if if if complexity is one

2970
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:43,039
that means i have one more edge then i

2971
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:45,118
have vertex

2972
01:44:43,039 --> 01:44:46,238
so i might have like

2973
01:44:45,118 --> 01:44:48,479
11

2974
01:44:46,238 --> 01:44:50,799
edges and 10 vertices

2975
01:44:48,479 --> 01:44:53,198
it's so it turns we call that a bicycle

2976
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:56,480
because it it it's got two loops and

2977
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:56,479
it's got to have two loops in it

2978
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:01,760
why can't it be trees just going off of

2979
01:45:00,158 --> 01:45:04,238
the loop

2980
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:05,280
that i would need more edges than

2981
01:45:04,238 --> 01:45:07,759
all right

2982
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:09,679
right okay so so every time i get

2983
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,840
another loop i i get

2984
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:13,199
another excess of edges over vertices i

2985
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:15,840
got you okay

2986
01:45:13,198 --> 01:45:18,079
so in other words uh

2987
01:45:15,840 --> 01:45:19,760
we start out and

2988
01:45:18,079 --> 01:45:21,600
after i have one loop i have one

2989
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:25,679
component that has

2990
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:28,560
a cycle in it not now the the next step

2991
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:30,719
uh according to the rumor would be that

2992
01:45:28,560 --> 01:45:33,440
at the next step i would have

2993
01:45:30,719 --> 01:45:33,439
a bicycle

2994
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:38,800
in the evolution of almost all graphs it

2995
01:45:36,079 --> 01:45:40,639
would go from cycle to a bicycle but in

2996
01:45:38,800 --> 01:45:41,600
fact there's a certain probability it

2997
01:45:40,639 --> 01:45:45,118
goes

2998
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:48,159
from cycle to two you know

2999
01:45:45,118 --> 01:45:50,158
to two different cycles all right

3000
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:51,599
um and i worked out the probability it

3001
01:45:50,158 --> 01:45:52,719
was something like five out of twenty

3002
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:54,719
four

3003
01:45:52,719 --> 01:45:56,560
that was pretty high

3004
01:45:54,719 --> 01:45:58,880
it was substantial yeah

3005
01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:00,560
uh but still

3006
01:45:58,880 --> 01:46:02,480
soon they're going to merge together

3007
01:46:00,560 --> 01:46:04,719
almost okay so

3008
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:05,678
that's so cool but but then it splits

3009
01:46:04,719 --> 01:46:08,158
again

3010
01:46:05,679 --> 01:46:11,199
after you have either either two or one

3011
01:46:08,158 --> 01:46:14,158
one uh the next step is you either have

3012
01:46:11,198 --> 01:46:15,678
three or you have two one or you have

3013
01:46:14,158 --> 01:46:19,279
one on one okay

3014
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:21,359
and so i worked out the probability

3015
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:22,319
for for those transitions

3016
01:46:21,359 --> 01:46:24,000
and

3017
01:46:22,319 --> 01:46:26,479
i worked it out up to

3018
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:28,880
up to the first five transitions

3019
01:46:26,479 --> 01:46:31,279
and i had these so i had these strange

3020
01:46:28,880 --> 01:46:33,840
numbers five twenty fours and i stayed

3021
01:46:31,279 --> 01:46:36,158
up all night and about three a.m

3022
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:38,319
i i had the numbers computed and i

3023
01:46:36,158 --> 01:46:42,638
looked at them and here were

3024
01:46:38,319 --> 01:46:42,639
the denominator was something like

3025
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:48,880
20 2 3 0 2 3.

3026
01:46:48,000 --> 01:46:50,800
so

3027
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:51,920
the probability was something over 2 3 0

3028
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,520
2 3.

3029
01:46:51,920 --> 01:46:55,359
i don't know how you worked that out but

3030
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:57,760
i had a formula of that you know i could

3031
01:46:55,359 --> 01:46:59,359
calculate the probability yeah and and i

3032
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:01,440
could find the limiting probability as n

3033
01:46:59,359 --> 01:47:04,000
goes to infinity and and it turned out

3034
01:47:01,439 --> 01:47:06,000
to be this number but the denominator

3035
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:08,639
was 2 0 and i and i looked at the

3036
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:11,198
denominator and i said wait a minute

3037
01:47:08,639 --> 01:47:14,800
this number factors because

3038
01:47:11,198 --> 01:47:16,238
1001 is equal to 7 times 11 times 13. i

3039
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:18,719
had learned that in my first computer

3040
01:47:16,238 --> 01:47:20,319
program so

3041
01:47:18,719 --> 01:47:22,239
so so

3042
01:47:20,319 --> 01:47:24,960
so 23023

3043
01:47:22,238 --> 01:47:28,319
yeah is 7 times 11 times

3044
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:30,319
13 times 23.

3045
01:47:28,319 --> 01:47:31,599
that's not a random number there has to

3046
01:47:30,319 --> 01:47:32,639
be a reason

3047
01:47:31,600 --> 01:47:34,840
why

3048
01:47:32,639 --> 01:47:37,279
those small primes appear in the

3049
01:47:34,840 --> 01:47:39,840
denominator but my think

3050
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:41,279
so all of a sudden that suggested

3051
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:43,119
um

3052
01:47:41,279 --> 01:47:45,439
another way of looking at the problem

3053
01:47:43,118 --> 01:47:46,880
where small prime factors

3054
01:47:45,439 --> 01:47:47,678
would occur

3055
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:50,880
so

3056
01:47:47,679 --> 01:47:52,239
what would that be so that said oh yeah

3057
01:47:50,880 --> 01:47:55,199
let me take the logarithm of this

3058
01:47:52,238 --> 01:47:56,799
formula and and sure enough it's going

3059
01:47:55,198 --> 01:47:58,319
to simplify

3060
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:59,520
and and it happened

3061
01:47:58,319 --> 01:48:01,279
so

3062
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:03,119
and i wouldn't have noticed it except

3063
01:48:01,279 --> 01:48:06,238
for this factorization

3064
01:48:03,118 --> 01:48:07,920
okay so i go to bed and i say okay this

3065
01:48:06,238 --> 01:48:09,599
is this looks like i'm slowing down the

3066
01:48:07,920 --> 01:48:10,639
big bang i can figure out what's going

3067
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,239
on here

3068
01:48:10,639 --> 01:48:14,000
and

3069
01:48:12,238 --> 01:48:16,718
the next day it turned out bill gates

3070
01:48:14,000 --> 01:48:18,960
comes to stanford to visit uh they're

3071
01:48:16,719 --> 01:48:20,880
trying to sell him on donating money to

3072
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:21,760
uh for a new computer science building

3073
01:48:20,880 --> 01:48:22,480
sure

3074
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:24,800
and

3075
01:48:22,479 --> 01:48:27,198
and they and uh so they gave me an

3076
01:48:24,800 --> 01:48:30,719
appointment to talk to bill and i

3077
01:48:27,198 --> 01:48:32,559
and i wrote down on the blackboard this

3078
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:34,319
this evolutionary diagram you're going

3079
01:48:32,560 --> 01:48:35,840
from one to two five twenty fourths in

3080
01:48:34,319 --> 01:48:38,479
all this business yeah

3081
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:39,920
and i wrote it down and anyway at the

3082
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:42,559
end of the day the

3083
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:45,039
uh he was discussing people with the

3084
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:47,119
with the uh development office and he

3085
01:48:45,039 --> 01:48:50,000
said boy i was really impressed with

3086
01:48:47,118 --> 01:48:51,519
what professor knuth said

3087
01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:53,198
about this

3088
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:56,159
giant component

3089
01:48:53,198 --> 01:48:58,238
and uh and so uh you know i i love this

3090
01:48:56,158 --> 01:49:00,479
story because it shows that

3091
01:48:58,238 --> 01:49:02,079
theoretical computer science has is

3092
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:03,759
really worthwhile you know

3093
01:49:02,079 --> 01:49:06,559
does bill have you ever talked to bill

3094
01:49:03,760 --> 01:49:07,760
gates about it uh since then

3095
01:49:06,560 --> 01:49:09,119
yeah

3096
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:12,239
that's a cool yeah that's a cool little

3097
01:49:09,118 --> 01:49:14,639
moment in history yeah but but anyway

3098
01:49:12,238 --> 01:49:16,000
he happened to visit on exactly the day

3099
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:18,480
after i had

3100
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:20,399
i i had found this pattern and

3101
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:24,079
that allowed me to to crack the problem

3102
01:49:20,399 --> 01:49:27,039
so you know so that i could develop the

3103
01:49:24,079 --> 01:49:29,198
uh the theory some more and understand

3104
01:49:27,039 --> 01:49:30,000
what's happening in the big but

3105
01:49:29,198 --> 01:49:32,158
uh

3106
01:49:30,000 --> 01:49:35,198
because i could i could now write down

3107
01:49:32,158 --> 01:49:36,479
explicit formulas for stuff right and so

3108
01:49:35,198 --> 01:49:37,919
it would you know

3109
01:49:36,479 --> 01:49:40,079
it would work not only the first few

3110
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:42,399
steps but also they'll study the whole

3111
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:43,599
process and and i worked further and

3112
01:49:42,399 --> 01:49:45,920
further and i

3113
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:47,760
with two authors co-authors and we

3114
01:49:45,920 --> 01:49:49,760
finally figured out

3115
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:50,960
that the probability

3116
01:49:49,760 --> 01:49:52,159
that

3117
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,000
the rumor

3118
01:49:52,158 --> 01:49:57,839
was true in other words look at the

3119
01:49:54,000 --> 01:50:01,279
evolution of a of a random graph going

3120
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:03,679
from zero zero to to complete

3121
01:50:01,279 --> 01:50:05,920
and say what's the probability that at

3122
01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:08,399
every point in time there was only one

3123
01:50:05,920 --> 01:50:09,840
component with a cycle

3124
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:11,679
we started with this rumor saying

3125
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:14,560
there's only one site there's only one

3126
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:15,440
component with the cycle and and

3127
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,960
uh

3128
01:50:15,439 --> 01:50:18,479
so

3129
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:20,560
it's a hundred percent

3130
01:50:18,479 --> 01:50:22,559
the rumor was that was 100

3131
01:50:20,560 --> 01:50:23,280
it turned out the actual numbers was

3132
01:50:22,560 --> 01:50:25,920
like

3133
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:27,519
percent or i i don't know i should

3134
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:30,000
remember the number but i do but i don't

3135
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:33,040
have it with me but but anyway

3136
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,198
but but the but the number

3137
01:50:33,039 --> 01:50:36,479
it it turned out to be like 12 over pi

3138
01:50:35,198 --> 01:50:38,719
squared or

3139
01:50:36,479 --> 01:50:38,718
anything

3140
01:50:39,599 --> 01:50:44,079
it was a nice

3141
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:45,520
it related to pi yeah um and we could

3142
01:50:44,079 --> 01:50:46,960
never have

3143
01:50:45,520 --> 01:50:48,880
done that with

3144
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:50,480
but so that's the hardest problem i ever

3145
01:50:48,880 --> 01:50:54,000
saw in my life was to prove that this

3146
01:50:50,479 --> 01:50:56,319
probability is is it was proven

3147
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:58,880
the probability was proven yeah i was

3148
01:50:56,319 --> 01:51:00,880
able to prove this that this

3149
01:50:58,880 --> 01:51:02,400
and and and this should shed light on a

3150
01:51:00,880 --> 01:51:05,199
whole bunch of other things about random

3151
01:51:02,399 --> 01:51:06,399
graphs that that was sort of the

3152
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:08,079
the major

3153
01:51:06,399 --> 01:51:08,799
thing we were asked after that's super

3154
01:51:08,079 --> 01:51:10,399
cool

3155
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:11,440
what was the connection to physics that

3156
01:51:10,399 --> 01:51:14,000
you mentioned

3157
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:15,759
well bose einstein statistics is the

3158
01:51:14,000 --> 01:51:18,319
study of how

3159
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:21,039
molecules uh

3160
01:51:18,319 --> 01:51:21,039
bond together

3161
01:51:21,679 --> 01:51:26,079
without geometry

3162
01:51:23,279 --> 01:51:26,079
without distance

3163
01:51:26,319 --> 01:51:33,359
you created the tech type setting system

3164
01:51:30,238 --> 01:51:35,598
and released it as open source

3165
01:51:33,359 --> 01:51:38,479
just on that little aspect

3166
01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:41,760
why did you release it as open source

3167
01:51:38,479 --> 01:51:44,079
what is your vision for open source

3168
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:46,719
no okay well that the word open source

3169
01:51:44,079 --> 01:51:50,559
didn't exist at that time but we but i i

3170
01:51:46,719 --> 01:51:52,719
didn't want proprietary rights over it

3171
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:53,760
because i saw

3172
01:51:52,719 --> 01:51:56,000
how

3173
01:51:53,760 --> 01:51:56,800
proprietary rights were holding things

3174
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,719
back

3175
01:51:56,800 --> 01:52:00,560
in the late 50s

3176
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:03,760
people at ibm developed the language

3177
01:52:00,560 --> 01:52:05,840
called fortran they could have

3178
01:52:03,760 --> 01:52:08,400
kept it proprietary they could have said

3179
01:52:05,840 --> 01:52:11,119
only ibm can use this language everybody

3180
01:52:08,399 --> 01:52:14,479
else has to but but they didn't

3181
01:52:11,118 --> 01:52:16,000
they said anybody who can write who can

3182
01:52:14,479 --> 01:52:17,118
translate fortran

3183
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,359
into the

3184
01:52:17,118 --> 01:52:20,799
into the language of their machines uh

3185
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:23,519
is allowed to

3186
01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:25,039
make fortran compilers too

3187
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:27,599
um

3188
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:28,840
on the other hand in the typography

3189
01:52:27,599 --> 01:52:31,760
industry i had

3190
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:33,360
seen a lot of languages that were

3191
01:52:31,760 --> 01:52:35,199
developed for

3192
01:52:33,359 --> 01:52:37,679
composing pages

3193
01:52:35,198 --> 01:52:40,799
and each manufacturer had his own

3194
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:43,039
language for composing pages

3195
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:45,440
and that was holding everything back

3196
01:52:43,039 --> 01:52:47,760
because people

3197
01:52:45,439 --> 01:52:49,598
were tied to a particular manufacturer

3198
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:51,760
and and then a new equipment is invented

3199
01:52:49,599 --> 01:52:53,119
a year later but printing printing

3200
01:52:51,760 --> 01:52:55,360
machines they have to

3201
01:52:53,118 --> 01:52:56,559
expect to amortize the cost over 20 30

3202
01:52:55,359 --> 01:52:58,639
years

3203
01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:02,320
so you didn't want that for tech

3204
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:05,840
i didn't need the income

3205
01:53:02,319 --> 01:53:06,719
okay i already i i already had

3206
01:53:05,840 --> 01:53:08,560
uh

3207
01:53:06,719 --> 01:53:09,439
a good job

3208
01:53:08,560 --> 01:53:11,199
and

3209
01:53:09,439 --> 01:53:13,839
you know

3210
01:53:11,198 --> 01:53:13,839
my books were

3211
01:53:14,639 --> 01:53:17,679
people were buying enough books that i

3212
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:21,199
that

3213
01:53:17,679 --> 01:53:23,039
that it would bring me

3214
01:53:21,198 --> 01:53:25,598
plenty of supplemental income for

3215
01:53:23,039 --> 01:53:26,719
everything my kids needed for education

3216
01:53:25,599 --> 01:53:28,800
whatever

3217
01:53:26,719 --> 01:53:31,920
so there was no reason for me to try to

3218
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:34,079
maximize income any further

3219
01:53:31,920 --> 01:53:35,440
income is sort of a threshold function

3220
01:53:34,079 --> 01:53:38,000
if you don't have

3221
01:53:35,439 --> 01:53:40,079
if you don't have enough you're starving

3222
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,679
but if if you get over the threshold

3223
01:53:40,079 --> 01:53:44,880
then you start thinking about

3224
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:47,440
philanthropy or else or you're trying to

3225
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:50,159
take it with you but uh

3226
01:53:47,439 --> 01:53:52,879
but anyway there's a i had

3227
01:53:50,158 --> 01:53:54,879
my income was over the threshold so

3228
01:53:52,880 --> 01:53:57,840
so that i i didn't need

3229
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:59,679
to keep it and so i specifically could

3230
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:02,719
see the advantage of

3231
01:53:59,679 --> 01:54:04,880
of of making it open for everybody

3232
01:54:02,719 --> 01:54:06,158
do you think uh most software should be

3233
01:54:04,880 --> 01:54:08,560
open

3234
01:54:06,158 --> 01:54:10,638
so i think that

3235
01:54:08,560 --> 01:54:13,119
people should charge for non-trivial

3236
01:54:10,639 --> 01:54:16,079
software but not for trivial software

3237
01:54:13,118 --> 01:54:19,759
yeah you give an example of i think

3238
01:54:16,079 --> 01:54:23,840
adobe photoshop versus on linux

3239
01:54:19,760 --> 01:54:26,800
as photoshop has value which so

3240
01:54:23,840 --> 01:54:28,880
it's definitely worth paying

3241
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:30,719
paying for all the stuff i mean

3242
01:54:28,880 --> 01:54:33,039
and i mean

3243
01:54:30,719 --> 01:54:35,118
well they keep adding

3244
01:54:33,039 --> 01:54:37,118
adding stuff that just

3245
01:54:35,118 --> 01:54:38,960
that my wife and i don't

3246
01:54:37,118 --> 01:54:42,000
care about but

3247
01:54:38,960 --> 01:54:43,198
somebody does but i mean but they have

3248
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:47,039
built in a

3249
01:54:43,198 --> 01:54:48,879
fantastic uh uh undo feature for example

3250
01:54:47,039 --> 01:54:52,000
in photoshop

3251
01:54:48,880 --> 01:54:54,079
where you you you can go through a

3252
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:55,359
sequence of a thousand complicated steps

3253
01:54:54,079 --> 01:54:56,559
on graphics and

3254
01:54:55,359 --> 01:54:58,559
it can

3255
01:54:56,560 --> 01:55:00,080
take you back anywhere in that sequence

3256
01:54:58,560 --> 01:55:02,400
yeah

3257
01:55:00,079 --> 01:55:04,800
with really beautiful algorithms i mean

3258
01:55:02,399 --> 01:55:06,399
yeah it's it's oh that's interesting i

3259
01:55:04,800 --> 01:55:07,760
didn't think about what algorithm it

3260
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:10,319
must be some kind of efficient

3261
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:13,039
representation really yeah i know i mean

3262
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:15,198
there's a lot of really subtle

3263
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:18,319
nobel prize class like

3264
01:55:15,198 --> 01:55:20,399
creation of intellectual property in in

3265
01:55:18,319 --> 01:55:22,880
there

3266
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:22,879
and uh

3267
01:55:23,599 --> 01:55:26,480
and

3268
01:55:24,238 --> 01:55:28,399
with patents uh you've got a limited

3269
01:55:26,479 --> 01:55:31,279
time to

3270
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:32,719
uh i mean eventually the idea of patents

3271
01:55:31,279 --> 01:55:34,559
is that you publish

3272
01:55:32,719 --> 01:55:36,960
so that it's not secret it's not a trade

3273
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:36,960
secret

3274
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:41,359
that said

3275
01:55:39,118 --> 01:55:44,639
you you've said that i currently use

3276
01:55:41,359 --> 01:55:46,799
ubuntu linux on a standalone laptop

3277
01:55:44,639 --> 01:55:49,118
it has no internet connection

3278
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:51,760
i occasionally carry flash memory drives

3279
01:55:49,118 --> 01:55:54,559
between the machine and the macs that i

3280
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:57,520
use for network surfing and graphics

3281
01:55:54,560 --> 01:55:58,880
but i trust my family jewels only to

3282
01:55:57,520 --> 01:56:00,880
linux

3283
01:55:58,880 --> 01:56:02,560
why do you love linux

3284
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:05,199
the version of linux that i use is

3285
01:56:02,560 --> 01:56:07,119
stable i i i

3286
01:56:05,198 --> 01:56:08,479
actually i i'm gonna have to upgrade one

3287
01:56:07,118 --> 01:56:10,960
of these days but

3288
01:56:08,479 --> 01:56:12,959
to a newer version of ubuntu yeah i'll

3289
01:56:10,960 --> 01:56:15,840
stick with ubuntu but

3290
01:56:12,960 --> 01:56:18,319
but uh right now i'm running

3291
01:56:15,840 --> 01:56:20,159
something that doesn't support a lot of

3292
01:56:18,319 --> 01:56:21,359
the new

3293
01:56:20,158 --> 01:56:24,479
software

3294
01:56:21,359 --> 01:56:25,439
the last stability i don't remember the

3295
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:28,799
number

3296
01:56:25,439 --> 01:56:32,559
like 14 anyway it's it's quite

3297
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:35,039
and i'm going to get a new computer um

3298
01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:36,000
i'm getting new um solid-state memory

3299
01:56:35,039 --> 01:56:38,560
instead of

3300
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:40,158
kind of a hard disk and the basics

3301
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:41,360
well let me ask you

3302
01:56:40,158 --> 01:56:44,559
um

3303
01:56:41,359 --> 01:56:46,399
sticking on the topic of tech

3304
01:56:44,560 --> 01:56:49,360
um

3305
01:56:46,399 --> 01:56:52,158
when thinking about beautiful typography

3306
01:56:49,359 --> 01:56:54,559
what is your favorite letter number or

3307
01:56:52,158 --> 01:56:54,559
symbol

3308
01:56:55,039 --> 01:56:58,399
i know i know ridiculous question but is

3309
01:56:57,279 --> 01:57:01,439
there some

3310
01:56:58,399 --> 01:57:01,439
let me show you there

3311
01:57:02,560 --> 01:57:04,719
or

3312
01:57:05,359 --> 01:57:09,238
look at the last page

3313
01:57:11,039 --> 01:57:14,319
at the very end of the index

3314
01:57:15,198 --> 01:57:19,039
what is that

3315
01:57:17,039 --> 01:57:22,319
there's a book by dr seuss called on

3316
01:57:19,039 --> 01:57:24,399
beyond zebra and he gave a name to that

3317
01:57:22,319 --> 01:57:28,799
did you say dr seuss gave a name to that

3318
01:57:24,399 --> 01:57:31,439
dr seuss this is uh s-e-u-s-s he he

3319
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:32,719
wrote children's books

3320
01:57:31,439 --> 01:57:34,960
in the 50s

3321
01:57:32,719 --> 01:57:36,079
40s and 50s

3322
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:37,439
wait are you talking about cat in the

3323
01:57:36,079 --> 01:57:39,039
hat doctor

3324
01:57:37,439 --> 01:57:40,638
yeah

3325
01:57:39,039 --> 01:57:44,158
that's it yeah i like how you hit this

3326
01:57:40,639 --> 01:57:45,279
on on beyond zebra did he did did it get

3327
01:57:44,158 --> 01:57:46,269
to

3328
01:57:45,279 --> 01:57:49,279
soviet union

3329
01:57:46,270 --> 01:57:51,040
[Laughter]

3330
01:57:49,279 --> 01:57:52,800
yeah doctors no we did

3331
01:57:51,039 --> 01:57:54,399
dr seuss did not come to the soviet

3332
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:56,719
union but

3333
01:57:54,399 --> 01:57:58,879
since you oh actually i think he did

3334
01:57:56,719 --> 01:58:00,399
actually a little bit when we were

3335
01:57:58,880 --> 01:58:03,520
um

3336
01:58:00,399 --> 01:58:06,879
that that was a uh

3337
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:09,679
his maybe cat in the hat or or green

3338
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:12,560
eggs and ham i think was used to learn

3339
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:14,639
english oh okay so i think it made it

3340
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:17,599
that way my my

3341
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:20,560
okay i i didn't like those as much

3342
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:21,760
as bartholomew cubbins but but i used to

3343
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:23,840
know

3344
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:24,719
bartholomew covens by heart when i was

3345
01:58:23,840 --> 01:58:26,319
young

3346
01:58:24,719 --> 01:58:27,599
so what the heck is this symbol we're

3347
01:58:26,319 --> 01:58:29,519
looking at

3348
01:58:27,599 --> 01:58:31,520
there's so much going on he has a name

3349
01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:32,800
for it at the end of his book on beyond

3350
01:58:31,520 --> 01:58:36,080
zebra

3351
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:37,840
who made it he did he did

3352
01:58:36,079 --> 01:58:40,960
so there's

3353
01:58:37,840 --> 01:58:43,840
it looks like a bunch of vines

3354
01:58:40,960 --> 01:58:45,279
uh well is that symbol of existence

3355
01:58:43,840 --> 01:58:48,719
by the way he

3356
01:58:45,279 --> 01:58:50,479
he made a movie in the early 50s

3357
01:58:48,719 --> 01:58:52,158
um i don't remember the name of the

3358
01:58:50,479 --> 01:58:53,598
movie now you can probably find it on

3359
01:58:52,158 --> 01:58:55,519
easily enough but

3360
01:58:53,599 --> 01:58:57,520
it it features uh

3361
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:59,840
dozens and dozens of pianos all playing

3362
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:03,599
together at the same time and

3363
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:05,520
but but the all the scenery is sort of

3364
01:59:03,599 --> 01:59:07,840
based on the kind of artwork that was in

3365
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:09,440
his books and uh

3366
01:59:07,840 --> 01:59:11,360
the fantasy big

3367
01:59:09,439 --> 01:59:14,319
you know

3368
01:59:11,359 --> 01:59:16,880
based of zeus land or so

3369
01:59:14,319 --> 01:59:17,759
and i saw the movie only once or twice

3370
01:59:16,880 --> 01:59:19,279
but it's

3371
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:22,400
but it's quite

3372
01:59:19,279 --> 01:59:24,158
i'd like to see it again

3373
01:59:22,399 --> 01:59:25,519
that's that's really fascinating that

3374
01:59:24,158 --> 01:59:27,679
you gave him

3375
01:59:25,520 --> 01:59:28,560
they gave him shout out here

3376
01:59:27,679 --> 01:59:31,279
okay

3377
01:59:28,560 --> 01:59:33,199
is there some elegant basic symbol that

3378
01:59:31,279 --> 01:59:34,158
you're attracted to some

3379
01:59:33,198 --> 01:59:35,839
uh

3380
01:59:34,158 --> 01:59:38,238
give something that gives you pleasure

3381
01:59:35,840 --> 01:59:39,599
something used a lot

3382
01:59:38,238 --> 01:59:41,039
pi

3383
01:59:39,599 --> 01:59:43,279
pi of course

3384
01:59:41,039 --> 01:59:47,439
uh i try to use pi

3385
01:59:43,279 --> 01:59:48,179
i as often as i can when i need a random

3386
01:59:47,439 --> 01:59:50,158
example

3387
01:59:48,180 --> 01:59:53,599
[Music]

3388
01:59:50,158 --> 01:59:55,679
because it doesn't have any

3389
01:59:53,599 --> 01:59:57,440
known characters so for

3390
01:59:55,679 --> 02:00:01,118
so for instance

3391
01:59:57,439 --> 02:00:03,519
i i don't have it here to show you but

3392
02:00:01,118 --> 02:00:07,519
do you do you know the put the uh the

3393
02:00:03,520 --> 02:00:09,360
the game called masu m-a-s-y-u

3394
02:00:07,520 --> 02:00:10,480
no it's it

3395
02:00:09,359 --> 02:00:12,880
it's a great

3396
02:00:10,479 --> 02:00:14,718
recreation i mean

3397
02:00:12,880 --> 02:00:19,440
sudoku is easier to understand but

3398
02:00:14,719 --> 02:00:21,760
matthew is it it is more addictive uh uh

3399
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:23,519
you you have black and white stones like

3400
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:26,079
like on a go board

3401
02:00:23,520 --> 02:00:28,800
and you have to draw a path that

3402
02:00:26,079 --> 02:00:30,880
goes straight through a white stone and

3403
02:00:28,800 --> 02:00:31,760
makes a right angle turn at the black

3404
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:33,520
stone

3405
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:35,360
um and

3406
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:37,920
it turns out to be really

3407
02:00:35,359 --> 02:00:40,799
really nice puzzle because it

3408
02:00:37,920 --> 02:00:42,319
doesn't involve numbers but with this

3409
02:00:40,800 --> 02:00:44,480
visual but it's

3410
02:00:42,319 --> 02:00:47,519
3d pleasant to to play with

3411
02:00:44,479 --> 02:00:49,279
so so i wanted to

3412
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:51,760
use it as example in art of computer

3413
02:00:49,279 --> 02:00:54,639
programming and i have

3414
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:56,400
i have exercise on how to design cool

3415
02:00:54,639 --> 02:00:58,719
massive puzzles

3416
02:00:56,399 --> 02:01:00,000
and uh you can find that on wikipedia

3417
02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:01,520
certainly uh

3418
02:01:00,000 --> 02:01:03,118
as an example

3419
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:06,400
m-a-s-y-u

3420
02:01:03,118 --> 02:01:07,920
um and and so i and so i decided i would

3421
02:01:06,399 --> 02:01:09,679
take pi

3422
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:11,760
the actual

3423
02:01:09,679 --> 02:01:15,199
image of it and it

3424
02:01:11,760 --> 02:01:16,159
had pixels and i i would put a stone

3425
02:01:15,198 --> 02:01:18,238
wherever

3426
02:01:16,158 --> 02:01:19,519
it belongs in the letter pi in the greek

3427
02:01:18,238 --> 02:01:21,279
letter pi

3428
02:01:19,520 --> 02:01:22,800
and and but

3429
02:01:21,279 --> 02:01:24,639
the problem was

3430
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:26,800
find a way to make some of the stones

3431
02:01:24,639 --> 02:01:28,159
white some of the stones black so that

3432
02:01:26,800 --> 02:01:30,960
there's a unique solution to the

3433
02:01:28,158 --> 02:01:30,960
mossview puzzle

3434
02:01:31,039 --> 02:01:34,000
that was

3435
02:01:31,920 --> 02:01:36,560
a good test case for my algorithm on how

3436
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,158
to design master puzzles because i i

3437
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:40,400
insisted in advance

3438
02:01:38,158 --> 02:01:41,920
that the stones had to be placed in

3439
02:01:40,399 --> 02:01:44,638
exactly the positions that make the

3440
02:01:41,920 --> 02:01:47,118
letter pie make a juice letter okay

3441
02:01:44,639 --> 02:01:48,719
all right that's cool and and

3442
02:01:47,118 --> 02:01:51,198
i saw you know

3443
02:01:48,719 --> 02:01:53,039
and it turned out there was a a

3444
02:01:51,198 --> 02:01:54,719
a unique way to do that

3445
02:01:53,039 --> 02:01:56,960
um and so

3446
02:01:54,719 --> 02:01:58,319
so pi is a

3447
02:01:56,960 --> 02:02:00,239
source of

3448
02:01:58,319 --> 02:02:01,920
of examples where i can

3449
02:02:00,238 --> 02:02:04,479
where i can prove that i'm starting with

3450
02:02:01,920 --> 02:02:07,359
something that isn't canned

3451
02:02:04,479 --> 02:02:09,118
and most most recently i was

3452
02:02:07,359 --> 02:02:10,960
writing about something called graceful

3453
02:02:09,118 --> 02:02:13,920
graphs

3454
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:15,760
uh graceful graphs

3455
02:02:13,920 --> 02:02:18,800
is the following

3456
02:02:15,760 --> 02:02:20,480
you have a graph that has

3457
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:22,560
m edges to it

3458
02:02:20,479 --> 02:02:25,359
all right and

3459
02:02:22,560 --> 02:02:27,119
you attach numbers to every vertex

3460
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:29,598
in the following way so every time you

3461
02:02:27,118 --> 02:02:31,359
have an edge between vertices

3462
02:02:29,599 --> 02:02:33,039
you take the difference between those

3463
02:02:31,359 --> 02:02:35,519
numbers

3464
02:02:33,039 --> 02:02:36,639
and and that difference is it's got to

3465
02:02:35,520 --> 02:02:38,960
be

3466
02:02:36,639 --> 02:02:41,359
tell you what edge it is so so

3467
02:02:38,960 --> 02:02:42,800
one edge two numbers will be one apart

3468
02:02:41,359 --> 02:02:46,158
there'll be another edge where the

3469
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:49,039
numbers are two apart and so uh great

3470
02:02:46,158 --> 02:02:52,000
computer problem can you find a graceful

3471
02:02:49,039 --> 02:02:54,399
way to label a graph

3472
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:56,800
so i started with a so i started with a

3473
02:02:54,399 --> 02:02:59,039
graph that i use for

3474
02:02:56,800 --> 02:03:00,719
an organic graph not

3475
02:02:59,039 --> 02:03:02,399
not a

3476
02:03:00,719 --> 02:03:04,800
mathematically symmetric graph or

3477
02:03:02,399 --> 02:03:06,960
anything and i take this i take the 49

3478
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,639
states of the united states

3479
02:03:06,960 --> 02:03:10,399
uh

3480
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:13,118
the edges that go from one state to the

3481
02:03:10,399 --> 02:03:14,559
next state so for example california be

3482
02:03:13,118 --> 02:03:15,920
next to oregon

3483
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,840
nevada

3484
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:19,520
arizona okay

3485
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:22,480
and and

3486
02:03:19,520 --> 02:03:26,719
and i include this district of columbia

3487
02:03:22,479 --> 02:03:28,638
uh so i have 49 i can't get at la alaska

3488
02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:30,639
and hawaii in there because they don't

3489
02:03:28,639 --> 02:03:33,279
touch you have to be able to drive from

3490
02:03:30,639 --> 02:03:36,480
one to the other so is there a graceful

3491
02:03:33,279 --> 02:03:38,800
labeling of of the united states

3492
02:03:36,479 --> 02:03:41,678
each state gets a number

3493
02:03:38,800 --> 02:03:43,440
and then if california is number 30 and

3494
02:03:41,679 --> 02:03:45,359
oregon is number 11.

3495
02:03:43,439 --> 02:03:47,598
that edge is going to be number

3496
02:03:45,359 --> 02:03:48,479
19. the difference between those right

3497
02:03:47,599 --> 02:03:50,960
okay

3498
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:52,000
so is there a way to do this for for all

3499
02:03:50,960 --> 02:03:54,480
the states

3500
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:57,118
and at that and so i was i was thinking

3501
02:03:54,479 --> 02:03:59,598
of having a contest uh

3502
02:03:57,118 --> 02:04:00,799
for people to to get it as graceful as

3503
02:03:59,599 --> 02:04:04,000
they could

3504
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:06,320
uh but my friend tamara kiki

3505
02:04:04,000 --> 02:04:08,560
actually solved the problem by proving

3506
02:04:06,319 --> 02:04:10,559
that i mean i was able i was able to get

3507
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:12,480
it down

3508
02:04:10,560 --> 02:04:14,639
within seven or something like that he

3509
02:04:12,479 --> 02:04:16,399
was able to get a perfect solution

3510
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:17,840
the actual solution or to prove that a

3511
02:04:16,399 --> 02:04:20,319
solution exists

3512
02:04:17,840 --> 02:04:22,480
more precisely i i had figured out a way

3513
02:04:20,319 --> 02:04:25,118
to put labels on so that

3514
02:04:22,479 --> 02:04:28,238
all the all the uh all the edges were

3515
02:04:25,118 --> 02:04:29,920
labeled somewhere between one and 117

3516
02:04:28,238 --> 02:04:31,598
but but there were some some get some

3517
02:04:29,920 --> 02:04:33,039
gaps in there because

3518
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:36,000
i should really have gone from one to

3519
02:04:33,039 --> 02:04:36,719
105 or what the whatever the number is

3520
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:38,960
so

3521
02:04:36,719 --> 02:04:40,560
i gave myself too much

3522
02:04:38,960 --> 02:04:42,639
you know a lot of slack

3523
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:44,560
he did it without any slack whatsoever a

3524
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:47,039
perfect grace for labeling

3525
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:49,599
and and so i you know i

3526
02:04:47,039 --> 02:04:51,679
call out the contest uh because the

3527
02:04:49,599 --> 02:04:53,760
problem is already solid and too easy in

3528
02:04:51,679 --> 02:04:54,880
a sense because tom was able to do it in

3529
02:04:53,760 --> 02:04:57,360
an afternoon

3530
02:04:54,880 --> 02:05:00,319
um he sorry he did the algorithm or for

3531
02:04:57,359 --> 02:05:01,759
this particular uh for the stick united

3532
02:05:00,319 --> 02:05:02,880
states for the united states this

3533
02:05:01,760 --> 02:05:05,039
problem is

3534
02:05:02,880 --> 02:05:06,960
this problem is incredibly hard i mean

3535
02:05:05,039 --> 02:05:08,639
for the general generally okay

3536
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:10,078
but it's like it's like coloring but it

3537
02:05:08,639 --> 02:05:13,279
was very lucky that we worked for the

3538
02:05:10,078 --> 02:05:15,279
united states sure um i think but but i

3539
02:05:13,279 --> 02:05:18,319
mean the theory is still very uncomplete

3540
02:05:15,279 --> 02:05:20,078
but but but anyway then tom came back a

3541
02:05:18,319 --> 02:05:22,078
couple days later and he had been able

3542
02:05:20,078 --> 02:05:23,679
to not only find a graceful labeling but

3543
02:05:22,078 --> 02:05:24,719
he

3544
02:05:23,679 --> 02:05:27,440
but

3545
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:29,118
the label of washington was 31.

3546
02:05:27,439 --> 02:05:30,799
the label of

3547
02:05:29,118 --> 02:05:35,359
of idaho

3548
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:36,079
was 41 following the digits of pi

3549
02:05:35,359 --> 02:05:37,439
yeah

3550
02:05:36,078 --> 02:05:40,000
going across

3551
02:05:37,439 --> 02:05:41,919
the topic of the united states he has

3552
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:43,359
the digits of pipeline did he do it on

3553
02:05:41,920 --> 02:05:45,118
purpose

3554
02:05:43,359 --> 02:05:48,158
he was able to still get a graceful

3555
02:05:45,118 --> 02:05:48,158
labeling with that with

3556
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:57,920
it's a miracle okay but yeah but um i

3557
02:05:56,560 --> 02:06:00,560
i i

3558
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:02,880
i like to use pie in my book you see and

3559
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:06,719
this is

3560
02:06:02,880 --> 02:06:08,719
all roads lead to pie yeah somehow um

3561
02:06:06,719 --> 02:06:10,880
somehow often hidden

3562
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:12,560
uh in the middle of like the the most

3563
02:06:10,880 --> 02:06:14,639
difficult problems

3564
02:06:12,560 --> 02:06:16,719
can i ask you about uh

3565
02:06:14,639 --> 02:06:19,840
productivity

3566
02:06:16,719 --> 02:06:21,520
productivity yeah you said that quote my

3567
02:06:19,840 --> 02:06:24,639
scheduling principle

3568
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:26,880
is to do the thing i hate most

3569
02:06:24,639 --> 02:06:29,679
uh on my to-do list

3570
02:06:26,880 --> 02:06:31,920
by week's end i'm very happy

3571
02:06:29,679 --> 02:06:33,440
can you explain this process to a

3572
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:35,279
productive life

3573
02:06:33,439 --> 02:06:36,879
oh i see well

3574
02:06:35,279 --> 02:06:39,198
but all the time i'm working out and

3575
02:06:36,880 --> 02:06:41,440
what i want i what i don't want to do

3576
02:06:39,198 --> 02:06:44,000
but still i'm glad to have all those

3577
02:06:41,439 --> 02:06:46,000
unpleasant tasks finished yes is that

3578
02:06:44,000 --> 02:06:49,439
something you would advise to others

3579
02:06:46,000 --> 02:06:51,439
well i yeah i i i don't know how to say

3580
02:06:49,439 --> 02:06:53,359
it

3581
02:06:51,439 --> 02:06:56,399
during the pandemic i feel my

3582
02:06:53,359 --> 02:06:57,759
productivity actually went down by half

3583
02:06:56,399 --> 02:06:59,920
um

3584
02:06:57,760 --> 02:07:01,440
because i have to

3585
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:03,920
um

3586
02:07:01,439 --> 02:07:06,158
i have to communicate by

3587
02:07:03,920 --> 02:07:08,239
writing which is slow i have to

3588
02:07:06,158 --> 02:07:10,319
i mean i i don't like to send out a bad

3589
02:07:08,238 --> 02:07:11,759
sentence so i

3590
02:07:10,319 --> 02:07:14,078
you know i go through and reread what

3591
02:07:11,760 --> 02:07:15,840
i've written and edit and fix it so so

3592
02:07:14,078 --> 02:07:16,719
everything takes a long a lot longer

3593
02:07:15,840 --> 02:07:19,360
when i'm

3594
02:07:16,719 --> 02:07:21,840
when i'm communicating by

3595
02:07:19,359 --> 02:07:23,198
by text messages um

3596
02:07:21,840 --> 02:07:24,480
instead of just

3597
02:07:23,198 --> 02:07:26,799
you know

3598
02:07:24,479 --> 02:07:28,718
together with somebody in the room and

3599
02:07:26,800 --> 02:07:30,560
it's also

3600
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:31,840
slower because the libraries are closed

3601
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:33,039
and stuff

3602
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:34,719
but there's another thing about

3603
02:07:33,039 --> 02:07:36,800
scheduling that i learned from my mother

3604
02:07:34,719 --> 02:07:38,158
that i should probably tell you and that

3605
02:07:36,800 --> 02:07:40,320
is

3606
02:07:38,158 --> 02:07:42,879
um it's different from what people in

3607
02:07:40,319 --> 02:07:44,559
robotics field do which is called

3608
02:07:42,880 --> 02:07:47,520
planning

3609
02:07:44,560 --> 02:07:49,360
so she had this principle

3610
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:51,119
that was

3611
02:07:49,359 --> 02:07:53,519
see something that needs to be done and

3612
02:07:51,118 --> 02:07:53,519
do it

3613
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:56,480
you know i would just

3614
02:07:54,960 --> 02:07:58,800
instead of saying i'm going to do this

3615
02:07:56,479 --> 02:07:59,598
first and do this first

3616
02:07:58,800 --> 02:08:01,840
just

3617
02:07:59,599 --> 02:08:01,840
you know

3618
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:07,199
just do it oh yeah pick this up you know

3619
02:08:04,960 --> 02:08:09,920
but you're at any one moment there's a

3620
02:08:07,198 --> 02:08:12,479
set of tasks that you can do and you're

3621
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:14,719
saying a good heuristic

3622
02:08:12,479 --> 02:08:15,678
is to do the the one you want to do

3623
02:08:14,719 --> 02:08:16,800
least

3624
02:08:15,679 --> 02:08:19,359
right

3625
02:08:16,800 --> 02:08:20,960
the one i haven't got any good reason

3626
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:22,559
i think

3627
02:08:20,960 --> 02:08:26,319
that i'll never be

3628
02:08:22,560 --> 02:08:28,320
able to do it any better than i am now

3629
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:29,519
i mean there are some things that that i

3630
02:08:28,319 --> 02:08:30,639
know

3631
02:08:29,520 --> 02:08:32,239
if i do

3632
02:08:30,639 --> 02:08:34,159
something else first i'll be able to do

3633
02:08:32,238 --> 02:08:36,158
that one better yeah but but but there's

3634
02:08:34,158 --> 02:08:37,519
some that are going to be harder because

3635
02:08:36,158 --> 02:08:40,158
you know

3636
02:08:37,520 --> 02:08:41,599
i i i i've forgotten some of the

3637
02:08:40,158 --> 02:08:43,118
groundwork that went into it or

3638
02:08:41,599 --> 02:08:45,840
something like that

3639
02:08:43,118 --> 02:08:47,598
so so i just finished uh a pretty tough

3640
02:08:45,840 --> 02:08:48,960
part of the book and

3641
02:08:47,599 --> 02:08:51,119
uh

3642
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:52,480
and so and so now i'm

3643
02:08:51,118 --> 02:08:53,839
you know doing the parts that are more

3644
02:08:52,479 --> 02:08:56,399
fun

3645
02:08:53,840 --> 02:08:59,199
but but but the the other thing is as

3646
02:08:56,399 --> 02:09:01,519
i'm writing the book of course i want

3647
02:08:59,198 --> 02:09:03,919
the reader to think that i'm happy all

3648
02:09:01,520 --> 02:09:06,480
the time i'm writing the book i i'm you

3649
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:08,960
know that it's upbeat i i i can have

3650
02:09:06,479 --> 02:09:10,718
humor i can you know i can i can say

3651
02:09:08,960 --> 02:09:11,760
this is cool you know

3652
02:09:10,719 --> 02:09:14,158
wow

3653
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:15,840
this uh i have to i have to disguise the

3654
02:09:14,158 --> 02:09:18,399
fact that

3655
02:09:15,840 --> 02:09:21,119
it was painful in any way to come up the

3656
02:09:18,399 --> 02:09:22,799
road to that excitement is painful yeah

3657
02:09:21,118 --> 02:09:25,519
it's laden with pain

3658
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:27,760
okay is is there um you've given some

3659
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:30,159
advice to people before

3660
02:09:27,760 --> 02:09:32,480
but can you um

3661
02:09:30,158 --> 02:09:35,118
can you you give me too too much credit

3662
02:09:32,479 --> 02:09:38,238
but anyway this is my this is my turn to

3663
02:09:35,118 --> 02:09:39,519
just not to say things that that that i

3664
02:09:38,238 --> 02:09:43,359
believe but

3665
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:45,920
but i want to preface it by saying um

3666
02:09:43,359 --> 02:09:48,319
i also believe that

3667
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:50,319
other people do a lot of these things

3668
02:09:48,319 --> 02:09:51,039
much better than i do so i can only tell

3669
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:53,198
you

3670
02:09:51,039 --> 02:09:55,359
my side of it

3671
02:09:53,198 --> 02:09:55,359
so

3672
02:09:55,439 --> 02:10:00,719
can i ask you to give advice

3673
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:02,880
to young people today to high school

3674
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:04,399
students to college students whether

3675
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:05,359
they're geeks

3676
02:10:04,399 --> 02:10:06,960
or

3677
02:10:05,359 --> 02:10:09,439
the other kind

3678
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:11,679
about how to live a life that they can

3679
02:10:09,439 --> 02:10:15,839
be proud of how to have a successful

3680
02:10:11,679 --> 02:10:15,840
career how to have a successful life

3681
02:10:16,238 --> 02:10:20,718
it's always the same as i've said before

3682
02:10:18,479 --> 02:10:22,399
i guess

3683
02:10:20,719 --> 02:10:24,158
not to

3684
02:10:22,399 --> 02:10:26,000
do something because you

3685
02:10:24,158 --> 02:10:27,118
because it's trendy

3686
02:10:26,000 --> 02:10:29,198
but

3687
02:10:27,118 --> 02:10:31,839
but it's something that you personally

3688
02:10:29,198 --> 02:10:33,919
feel that you were called to do

3689
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:34,960
right rather than somebody else expects

3690
02:10:33,920 --> 02:10:36,239
you to do

3691
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:38,639
how do you know

3692
02:10:36,238 --> 02:10:40,479
you're called to do something

3693
02:10:38,639 --> 02:10:42,319
you try it and it works or you or it

3694
02:10:40,479 --> 02:10:44,879
took or it doesn't work i mean you you

3695
02:10:42,319 --> 02:10:46,479
learn about yourself

3696
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:48,480
life is a binary search you try

3697
02:10:46,479 --> 02:10:50,000
something and you find out oh yeah i

3698
02:10:48,479 --> 02:10:50,799
have a background that helped me with

3699
02:10:50,000 --> 02:10:51,679
this

3700
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:52,719
or

3701
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:53,760
or or

3702
02:10:52,719 --> 02:10:54,800
maybe

3703
02:10:53,760 --> 02:10:56,400
maybe i

3704
02:10:54,800 --> 02:10:58,639
i could do this if i worked a little bit

3705
02:10:56,399 --> 02:11:00,638
harder but you try something else and

3706
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:02,960
you say wait i have really no intuition

3707
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:04,078
for this and it looks like

3708
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:05,439
uh

3709
02:11:04,078 --> 02:11:07,439
you know it looks like it doesn't have

3710
02:11:05,439 --> 02:11:09,359
my name on it

3711
02:11:07,439 --> 02:11:11,359
it was there advice along the way that

3712
02:11:09,359 --> 02:11:13,679
you got

3713
02:11:11,359 --> 02:11:15,839
about what you should and shouldn't work

3714
02:11:13,679 --> 02:11:17,279
on or do you just try to listen to

3715
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:19,840
yourself yeah

3716
02:11:17,279 --> 02:11:22,399
i probably overreacted another way

3717
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:25,440
when something when i see everybody else

3718
02:11:22,399 --> 02:11:27,839
do going some way i probably

3719
02:11:25,439 --> 02:11:30,479
i i'd probably say not too much

3720
02:11:27,840 --> 02:11:30,480
competition

3721
02:11:30,639 --> 02:11:35,359
but yeah but but uh

3722
02:11:33,039 --> 02:11:36,880
but mostly i i

3723
02:11:35,359 --> 02:11:39,679
played with things that were interesting

3724
02:11:36,880 --> 02:11:42,239
to me and then later on i found

3725
02:11:39,679 --> 02:11:43,840
oh actually the most important thing i

3726
02:11:42,238 --> 02:11:46,078
learned was how to be interested in

3727
02:11:43,840 --> 02:11:46,880
almost anything yeah i mean not to be

3728
02:11:46,078 --> 02:11:49,519
bored

3729
02:11:46,880 --> 02:11:51,920
it hurts it makes me

3730
02:11:49,520 --> 02:11:55,040
very sad when i when i see kids talking

3731
02:11:51,920 --> 02:11:55,039
to each other and they say

3732
02:11:55,439 --> 02:11:59,039
that was boring

3733
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:01,118
and

3734
02:11:59,039 --> 02:12:04,238
to me

3735
02:12:01,118 --> 02:12:06,000
a person should feel

3736
02:12:04,238 --> 02:12:07,678
upset if he would help

3737
02:12:06,000 --> 02:12:10,078
if he had to admit that he wasn't able

3738
02:12:07,679 --> 02:12:11,440
to find something interesting

3739
02:12:10,078 --> 02:12:13,359
so uh uh

3740
02:12:11,439 --> 02:12:16,719
you know the skill they

3741
02:12:13,359 --> 02:12:18,639
they say i haven't learned how to

3742
02:12:16,719 --> 02:12:21,359
how to enjoy life i have to have

3743
02:12:18,639 --> 02:12:23,118
somebody entertain me instead of right

3744
02:12:21,359 --> 02:12:25,920
that's really interesting it is a skill

3745
02:12:23,118 --> 02:12:27,598
uh david foster wallace

3746
02:12:25,920 --> 02:12:29,279
i really like

3747
02:12:27,599 --> 02:12:32,960
the thing he says about this which is

3748
02:12:29,279 --> 02:12:35,118
the key to life is to be unborable

3749
02:12:32,960 --> 02:12:36,319
and i do really like you saying that

3750
02:12:35,118 --> 02:12:38,319
it's a skill

3751
02:12:36,319 --> 02:12:40,479
because i think that's a really good

3752
02:12:38,319 --> 02:12:42,799
that's really good advice which is if

3753
02:12:40,479 --> 02:12:45,118
you find something boring

3754
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:47,760
that's not

3755
02:12:45,118 --> 02:12:50,158
i don't believe it's because

3756
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:52,159
it's boring it's because you haven't

3757
02:12:50,158 --> 02:12:54,238
developed i have learned how to how to

3758
02:12:52,158 --> 02:12:55,118
find the beauty and how to find the fun

3759
02:12:54,238 --> 02:12:56,559
in it

3760
02:12:55,118 --> 02:12:57,759
yeah that's a that's a really really

3761
02:12:56,560 --> 02:12:59,760
good point

3762
02:12:57,760 --> 02:13:02,000
you know sometimes it's

3763
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:03,280
more difficult than others

3764
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:06,000
to do this but

3765
02:13:03,279 --> 02:13:08,719
i mean during the covet

3766
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,039
lots of days when i did when i never saw

3767
02:13:08,719 --> 02:13:12,399
another human being but um

3768
02:13:11,039 --> 02:13:16,319
but

3769
02:13:12,399 --> 02:13:19,759
i i i still find other ways to

3770
02:13:16,319 --> 02:13:22,000
it still was a pretty fun time yeah yeah

3771
02:13:19,760 --> 02:13:22,800
i came earlier i came a few minutes

3772
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:24,238

today and i

3774
02:13:24,238 --> 02:13:28,158

02:13:37,679 --> 02:13:42,000
life is amazing it's full of amazing

3781
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:43,679
things like this yeah i just sometimes

3782
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:45,359
i'll i'll sit there and just stare at a

3783
02:13:43,679 --> 02:13:47,118
tree

3784
02:13:45,359 --> 02:13:48,880
nature is beautiful

3785
02:13:47,118 --> 02:13:50,399
uh let me ask you the big ridiculous

3786
02:13:48,880 --> 02:13:52,319
question i don't think i asked you last

3787
02:13:50,399 --> 02:13:53,759
time i have to ask this time in case you

3788
02:13:52,319 --> 02:13:57,599
have a good answer

3789
02:13:53,760 --> 02:13:59,920
what is the meaning of life

3790
02:13:57,599 --> 02:14:01,590
our existence here on earth

3791
02:13:59,920 --> 02:14:06,078
the whole thing

3792
02:14:01,590 --> 02:14:08,400
[Laughter]

3793
02:14:06,078 --> 02:14:10,559
no no you can't you can't i will not

3794
02:14:08,399 --> 02:14:12,479
allow you to uh to try to escape

3795
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:14,560
answering this question you have to

3796
02:14:12,479 --> 02:14:17,279
answer definitively

3797
02:14:14,560 --> 02:14:19,840
uh because they're they're surely

3798
02:14:17,279 --> 02:14:22,479
surely don knuth there must be an answer

3799
02:14:19,840 --> 02:14:23,599
what is the answer is it 42 or wherever

3800
02:14:22,479 --> 02:14:27,039
yeah well i don't think it's the

3801
02:14:23,599 --> 02:14:27,039
numerical that's that's

3802
02:14:28,158 --> 02:14:35,118
okay but all right so so anyway um

3803
02:14:32,319 --> 02:14:36,158
it's only for me and

3804
02:14:35,118 --> 02:14:38,960
but i

3805
02:14:36,158 --> 02:14:42,399
but i personally

3806
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:46,239
think of my belief that

3807
02:14:42,399 --> 02:14:47,839
that god exists although i have no idea

3808
02:14:46,238 --> 02:14:51,439
what that means

3809
02:14:47,840 --> 02:14:51,440
but i believe that there is

3810
02:14:51,679 --> 02:14:54,399
some

3811
02:14:53,359 --> 02:14:56,158
something

3812
02:14:54,399 --> 02:14:57,039
beyond human

3813
02:14:56,158 --> 02:14:58,638
uh

3814
02:14:57,039 --> 02:15:00,800
capabilities

3815
02:14:58,639 --> 02:15:04,159
um and it might be uh

3816
02:15:00,800 --> 02:15:06,480
uh it might be some ai

3817
02:15:04,158 --> 02:15:09,439
but but whatever it is but but whatever

3818
02:15:06,479 --> 02:15:12,000
i but i do believe that

3819
02:15:09,439 --> 02:15:12,879
that there is

3820
02:15:12,000 --> 02:15:14,719
something

3821
02:15:12,880 --> 02:15:17,679
that goes beyond

3822
02:15:14,719 --> 02:15:20,719
the realm of human understanding

3823
02:15:17,679 --> 02:15:23,359
but but that that i can

3824
02:15:20,719 --> 02:15:24,960
try to

3825
02:15:23,359 --> 02:15:28,559
learn more about

3826
02:15:24,960 --> 02:15:31,279
how to resonate with whatever that

3827
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:32,960
being would like me to do

3828
02:15:31,279 --> 02:15:36,000
so do you think you can

3829
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:38,719
have occasional glimpses of that being i

3830
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:41,039
i strive for that

3831
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:43,439
not that i

3832
02:15:41,039 --> 02:15:45,118
ever think i'm going to get close to it

3833
02:15:43,439 --> 02:15:47,598
but but it's not

3834
02:15:45,118 --> 02:15:48,719
it's not for me it's it's saying what

3835
02:15:47,599 --> 02:15:51,199
should i do

3836
02:15:48,719 --> 02:15:54,719
that that big being wants me to do

3837
02:15:51,198 --> 02:15:57,118
that's that's you know i i'm trying to

3838
02:15:54,719 --> 02:15:57,118
ask

3839
02:15:59,039 --> 02:16:02,319
what that

3840
02:16:00,238 --> 02:16:04,319
i mean does that being want me to to be

3841
02:16:02,319 --> 02:16:09,599
talking to lex friedman right now you

3842
02:16:04,319 --> 02:16:12,319
know and i said yes okay but thank you

3843
02:16:09,599 --> 02:16:13,119
well thank you

3844
02:16:12,319 --> 02:16:15,279
but

3845
02:16:13,118 --> 02:16:16,960
yeah what i'm trying to say is

3846
02:16:15,279 --> 02:16:18,078
i'm not trying to say what

3847
02:16:16,960 --> 02:16:19,760
of all the

3848
02:16:18,078 --> 02:16:22,238
strategies i could choose or something

3849
02:16:19,760 --> 02:16:25,199
which one

3850
02:16:22,238 --> 02:16:28,158
i i try to do it not not strategically

3851
02:16:25,198 --> 02:16:28,158
but i try to

3852
02:16:28,479 --> 02:16:30,399
to

3853
02:16:29,439 --> 02:16:33,119
imagine

3854
02:16:30,399 --> 02:16:34,398
that i'm following somebody's wishes

3855
02:16:33,120 --> 02:16:36,639
even though

3856
02:16:34,398 --> 02:16:38,159
you're not smart enough to to know what

3857
02:16:36,638 --> 02:16:41,119
they are yeah

3858
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:44,159
but that funny little dance well i i i

3859
02:16:41,120 --> 02:16:44,960
mean this ai or whatever is it probably

3860
02:16:44,159 --> 02:16:47,359
is

3861
02:16:44,959 --> 02:16:49,759
it is smart enough to help to give me

3862
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:49,760
clues

3863
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:54,079
and uh

3864
02:16:52,478 --> 02:16:55,199
to make the whole journey from clue to

3865
02:16:54,079 --> 02:16:58,558
clue

3866
02:16:55,200 --> 02:17:00,000
a fun one yeah i mean it's as so many

3867
02:16:58,558 --> 02:17:01,518
people have said it's the journey not

3868
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:02,318
the destination

3869
02:17:01,519 --> 02:17:03,920
and

3870
02:17:02,318 --> 02:17:06,398
people live

3871
02:17:03,920 --> 02:17:09,599
live through crises help each other all

3872
02:17:06,398 --> 02:17:12,718
these things come up

3873
02:17:09,599 --> 02:17:16,398
history repeats itself

3874
02:17:12,718 --> 02:17:18,638
you try to say in the world today

3875
02:17:16,398 --> 02:17:23,199
is there any government that's working i

3876
02:17:18,638 --> 02:17:23,199
i read history i i know that things were

3877
02:17:23,679 --> 02:17:27,519
they they were they were

3878
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:29,760
there were a lot worse

3879
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:31,439
in many ways there's a lot of bad things

3880
02:17:29,760 --> 02:17:33,120
all the time

3881
02:17:31,439 --> 02:17:35,200
and i read about

3882
02:17:33,120 --> 02:17:36,719
you know i i look at

3883
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:37,920
things and people had good ideas and

3884
02:17:36,718 --> 02:17:40,159
they were working

3885
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:43,040
on great projects and then i know that

3886
02:17:40,159 --> 02:17:45,039
it didn't succeed though in the end

3887
02:17:43,040 --> 02:17:46,399
uh but but the new insight i've gotten

3888
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:49,519
him actually

3889
02:17:46,398 --> 02:17:51,439
in that way was i i was reading

3890
02:17:49,519 --> 02:17:53,200
uh what what book was i reading now

3891
02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:55,679
recently it was

3892
02:17:53,200 --> 02:17:58,800
it was by ken follett and it was called

3893
02:17:55,679 --> 02:18:01,200
the man from saint petersburg but it but

3894
02:17:58,799 --> 02:18:02,959
but it was talking about the prequel to

3895
02:18:01,200 --> 02:18:05,040
world war one

3896
02:18:02,959 --> 02:18:08,318
and winston churchill

3897
02:18:05,040 --> 02:18:10,160
according to this book uh sees that

3898
02:18:08,318 --> 02:18:12,959
that germany has been spending all its

3899
02:18:10,159 --> 02:18:14,239
gold reserves uh building up a huge

3900
02:18:12,959 --> 02:18:16,318
military

3901
02:18:14,239 --> 02:18:18,478
and there's no question that

3902
02:18:16,318 --> 02:18:20,959
if germany would attack england that

3903
02:18:18,478 --> 02:18:21,840
england would be wiped out

3904
02:18:20,959 --> 02:18:24,558
um

3905
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:25,280
so he wants russia to help

3906
02:18:24,558 --> 02:18:27,039
uh

3907
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:28,399
to attack germany from the other side

3908
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,160
because germany doesn't have enough of

3909
02:18:28,398 --> 02:18:33,039
an army to

3910
02:18:30,159 --> 02:18:34,799
to be fighting two wars at one

3911
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:38,399
okay now

3912
02:18:34,799 --> 02:18:39,920
then there's an anarchist in russia

3913
02:18:38,398 --> 02:18:42,159
who sees

3914
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:42,159
that

3915
02:18:42,239 --> 02:18:46,478
wars are

3916
02:18:44,318 --> 02:18:49,039
something that leaders start but

3917
02:18:46,478 --> 02:18:50,840
actually people get killed

3918
02:18:49,040 --> 02:18:54,399
and so he

3919
02:18:50,840 --> 02:18:57,200
wants to stop

3920
02:18:54,398 --> 02:18:59,760
any alliance between england and russia

3921
02:18:57,200 --> 02:19:01,679
because that would mean that

3922
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:04,318
a thousand thousand people of russia

3923
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:06,879
would would be killed that wouldn't be

3924
02:19:04,318 --> 02:19:08,239
otherwise killed

3925
02:19:06,879 --> 02:19:10,478
all right and so

3926
02:19:08,239 --> 02:19:12,558
his his life's goal

3927
02:19:10,478 --> 02:19:15,920
is to assassinate

3928
02:19:12,558 --> 02:19:18,159
a russian prince who's visiting england

3929
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:20,000
because that will make will mean the

3930
02:19:18,159 --> 02:19:20,959
czar will not form the alliance all

3931
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:23,519
right

3932
02:19:20,959 --> 02:19:25,199
so we have this

3933
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:27,439
question

3934
02:19:25,200 --> 02:19:28,880
about what should the government do

3935
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:30,880
should it actually

3936
02:19:28,879 --> 02:19:33,039
do something that will lead to

3937
02:19:30,879 --> 02:19:35,598
you know is is the war inevitable or is

3938
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:39,359
there a way to have peace and and this

3939
02:19:35,599 --> 02:19:41,840
just did and it struck me that if i were

3940
02:19:39,359 --> 02:19:43,679
in a position of responsibility work for

3941
02:19:41,840 --> 02:19:46,159
people's lives

3942
02:19:43,679 --> 02:19:48,159
in most cases i wouldn't have i wouldn't

3943
02:19:46,159 --> 02:19:49,920
have any confidence that any of my

3944
02:19:48,159 --> 02:19:52,398
decisions were good

3945
02:19:49,920 --> 02:19:53,200
that that that these these questions are

3946
02:19:52,398 --> 02:19:54,318
too

3947
02:19:53,200 --> 02:19:55,680
hard

3948
02:19:54,318 --> 02:19:57,519
probably for any human being but

3949
02:19:55,680 --> 02:20:00,079
certainly for me

3950
02:19:57,520 --> 02:20:02,479
well i think

3951
02:20:00,079 --> 02:20:04,000
i think coupling the

3952
02:20:02,478 --> 02:20:06,398
not being sure

3953
02:20:04,000 --> 02:20:09,600
that the decisions are right so that

3954
02:20:06,398 --> 02:20:11,119
that's actually a really good thing

3955
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:12,800
coupled with the fact that you do have

3956
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:16,399
to make a decision

3957
02:20:12,799 --> 02:20:20,478
and carry the burden of that and

3958
02:20:16,398 --> 02:20:23,680
ultimately i have faith in human beings

3959
02:20:20,478 --> 02:20:26,639
and the great leaders to arise

3960
02:20:23,680 --> 02:20:28,720
uh and help build a better world i mean

3961
02:20:26,639 --> 02:20:30,879
that's the hope of democracy that's done

3962
02:20:28,719 --> 02:20:30,879
yeah

3963
02:20:31,359 --> 02:20:36,000
enhance their abilities with uh

3964
02:20:34,719 --> 02:20:39,840
with algorithms

3965
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:42,000
