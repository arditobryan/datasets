00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
the following is a conversation with jed

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,919
buckwald a professor of history and a

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,638
philosopher of science at caltech

4
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:12,399
interested especially in the development

5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:15,518
of scientific concepts and the

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,439
instruments used to create and explore

7
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,519
new effects and ideas in science

00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:29,598
this is the lex friedman podcast and

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,599
here is my conversation with jed

12
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,280
buckwald

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,238
the science progress

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,719
via paradigm shifts and uh revolutions

15
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:41,280
as philosopher thomas kuhn said or does

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,239
it progress gradually what do you think

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,879
well i got into this field because i was

18
00:00:44,238 --> 00:00:49,119
tom coons research assistant 50 years

19
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:51,119
ago 52 years ago

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,558
he pulled me into it out of physics

21
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,038
instead

22
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:57,359
so i know his work pretty well and in

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,480
the years when i was at mit running an

24
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:00,640
institute

25
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,718
he was then in the philosophy department

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,680
used to come over all the time

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,920
to the talks we held and so on

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
so what would i say about that he of

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,879
course developed his ideas a lot over

30
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:14,319
the years yes the thing that he's famous

31
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:16,319
for the

32
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,719
structure of scientific revolutions came

33
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:20,319
out in 62

34
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,118
and um

35
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:25,118
as you just said it offered

36
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,359
an outline for what he called a

37
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,560
paradigmatic structure namely the notion

38
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,118
that

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,359
you have to look at what scientists do

40
00:01:31,118 --> 00:01:38,000
is forming a community of investigators

41
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:41,039
and that they're trying to solve various

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,959
puzzles as he would put it that crop up

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,118
figuring out how this works how that

44
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:47,919
works and so on and of course they don't

45
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,920
do it out of the blue they do it within

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,118
a certain framework the framework can be

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,960
pretty vague

48
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,759
he called it a paradigm

49
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,000
and his notion was that eventually they

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,200
run into troubles or what he called

51
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,438
anomalies that kind of cracks things

52
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,159
somebody new comes along with a

53
00:02:03,438 --> 00:02:09,519
different way of doing it etc do i think

54
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,439
things work that way no not really

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,360
tom and i used to have lengthy

56
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,359
discussions about that over the years

57
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,920
i do think there is a common structure

58
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,400
that formulates both theoretical and

59
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,479
experimental practices

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,039
and historians nowadays of science like

61
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:31,919
to refer to scientific work as what

62
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,878
scientists practice it's uh almost

63
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,878
craftsmen like

64
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,120
they can usually adapt in various ways

65
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:42,719
and i can give you all kinds of examples

66
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,519
of that i

67
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:48,318
once wrote a book on the origins of wave

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,280
theory of light and that is one of the

69
00:02:48,318 --> 00:02:53,199
paradigmatic examples that tom used only

70
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,400
it didn't work that way

71
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:57,839
exactly because he thought that what

72
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,439
happened was

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,319
that the

74
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,400
wave theory ran into trouble with a

75
00:03:02,318 --> 00:03:05,679
certain phenomenon which it couldn't

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,439
crack

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,400
well it turned out that in fact

78
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,800
historically that phenomenon was

79
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,480
actually um

80
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,319
not relevant

81
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:18,560
later on to the wave theory and when the

82
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:20,079
wave theory came in

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,080
the alternative to it which had

84
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,560
prevailed which was newton's views of

85
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,560
light as particles

86
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,878
that it seemed couldn't explain what the

87
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,598
wave theory could explain again not true

88
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:36,479
not true and much more complex than that

89
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,079
the wave theory offered the opportunity

90
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,639
to deploy

91
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,280
novel experimental and mathematical

92
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:46,238
structures which gave younger

93
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,640
scientists mathematicians and others the

94
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,759
opportunity to

95
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:51,839
effect

96
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,079
manufacture make

97
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,000
new sorts of devices

98
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,719
it's not that the alternative couldn't

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,598
sort of explain these things but it

100
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:04,479
never was able to generate them

101
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,399
de novo as novelties in other words if

102
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,840
you think of it as something scientists

103
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,158
want to

104
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,080
progress in the sense of finding new

105
00:04:10,158 --> 00:04:14,239
stuff to solve

106
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,319
then i think what often happens is is

107
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,959
that it's not so much that the

108
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:21,358
prevailing view can't crack something as

109
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,120
that it doesn't give you the opportunity

110
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,879
to do new stuff

111
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,439
when you say new stuff are we referring

112
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:29,680
to experimental science here or new

113
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,800
stuff in the space of uh new theories

114
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,720
could be both it could be both actually

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
so how does that can maybe elaborate a

116
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,400
little bit on the story of the wave

117
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,560
sure

118
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:42,799
the prevailing view of light

119
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,560
at least in france where the wave theory

120
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,960
really first took off although it had

121
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,040
been introduced in england by thomas

122
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,519
young the prevailing theory dates back

123
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,919
to newton that light is a stream of

124
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:56,478
particles and that refraction and

125
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,319
reflection involve sort of repulsive and

126
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,038
attractive forces

127
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:03,120
that deflect and bend the paths of these

128
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,680
particles

129
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,759
newton was not able successfully to deal

130
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,000
with the phenomenon of

131
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:13,520
what happens when light goes past a

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,439
knife's edge or a sharp edge what we now

133
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,279
call diffraction

134
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:19,199
he had

135
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:22,638
cooked up something about it that no

136
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,038
mathematical structure could be applied

137
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:28,000
thomas young first but really this guy

138
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:29,839
named augustan fernell in france

139
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,560
deployed

140
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,638
in fresnel's case rather advanced

141
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,839
calculus forms

142
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,120
of mathematics which enabled

143
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:41,839
computations to be done

144
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,360
and observations to be melded with these

145
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:46,638
computations

146
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,038
in a way that you could not do or see

147
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,199
how to do with newton did that mean that

148
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,599
the newtonian explanation of what goes

149
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:58,000
on and diffraction fails

150
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,639
not really you can you can actually

151
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,519
make it work but you can't generate

152
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,120
anything new out of it whereas

153
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,198
using the mathematics of wave optics in

154
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,199
respect to a particular phenomenon

155
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,520
called polarization

156
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,439
which ironically was discovered by

157
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,399
partisans of newton's way of doing

158
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,240
things

159
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:22,638
you were able to generate devices

160
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,160
which reflect light in crystals do

161
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,720
various things

162
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,639
that the newtonian way

163
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,319
could accommodate only after the fact

164
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,680
they couldn't generate it from the

165
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,280
beginning and so if you want to be

166
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,000
somebody who is working a novel vein

167
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,119
which increasingly becomes the case with

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,279
uh

169
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,560
people who become what we now call

170
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:50,799
physicists in the 1820s 30s and 40s

171
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,319
in particular then that's the direction

172
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
you're going to go but there were

173
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,199
holdouts until the 1850s

174
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,799
i want to try to elaborate on the nature

175
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,199
of the disagreement you have with thomas

176
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,759
kuhn so do you still believe in paradigm

177
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,439
shifts do you still see that there is

178
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,639
ideas that really have a

179
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:10,319
transformational effect on science

180
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,560
you just the nature of the disagreement

181
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,439
has to do with how those

182
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:18,160
paradigm shifts come to be

183
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:20,719
how they come to be and how they change

184
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,160
i certainly think they exist

185
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:27,520
how strong they may be at any given time

186
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,199
is maybe not quite as powerful as tom

187
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,959
thought in general

188
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,160
although towards the end of his life he

189
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,680
was beginning to develop uh different uh

190
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,919
modifications

191
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,680
of his original way of thinking

192
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,719
but i don't think that the changes

193
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,720
happen quite so

194
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:49,598
neatly if you will in reaction to um

195
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,959
novel experimental observations making

196
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,959
much more complex than that

197
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,240
in terms of neatness

198
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,959
how much of science progresses by

199
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,079
individual lone geniuses

200
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:07,359
and how much by the messy collaboration

201
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:07,359
of competing and

202
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,720
cooperating humans

203
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,680
i don't think you can cut

204
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,319
that

205
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,918
with a knife to say it's this percent

206
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,960
and that percent

207
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,839
it's

208
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:26,878
almost always the case that there are

209
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:28,560
one or two or maybe three

210
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,360
individuals

211
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,598
who

212
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,158
are sort of central

213
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:36,080
to what goes on when things begin to

214
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,200
shift

215
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,839
are they inevitably and solely

216
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,680
responsible for what then

217
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,040
begins to happen

218
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:49,278
um in a major way i think not

219
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,319
it depends you can go

220
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:55,439
very far back with this

221
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,399
even into antiquity to see what goes on

222
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,440
um

223
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,120
the locus the major locus we always talk

224
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,519
about from the beginning is if you're

225
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,959
talking about galileo's work on motion

226
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,839
for example

227
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:10,559
uh were there ways of accommodating it

228
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:14,160
that others could adapt to without

229
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:16,799
buying into the whole scheme yes

230
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,958
did it eventually evolve and start

231
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,278
convincing people because you could also

232
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:23,199
do other things with it that you

233
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,320
couldn't otherwise do

234
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:28,480
also yes let me give you an example the

235
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,000
great french mathematician philosopher

236
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,800
descartes

237
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,720
who uh was a mechanical philosopher he

238
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:37,278
believed the world was

239
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,600
matter in motion he never thought much

240
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,559
of what galileo had done in respect to

241
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,240
motion

242
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,159
because he thought well at best it's

243
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,759
some sort of approximative scheme or

244
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:48,000
something like that

245
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,360
but one of his

246
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,039
initial

247
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,800
i wouldn't call him a disciple but

248
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:55,360
follower who then broke with him in a

249
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,079
number of ways was a man named christian

250
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,519
huygens who was along with newton one of

251
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,079
the two greatest

252
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:06,000
scientists of the 17th century

253
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:09,679
huygens is older than newton and huygens

254
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,559
nicely deployed galilean relationships

255
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:15,199
in respect to motion to develop all

256
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:16,799
sorts of things including the first

257
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,278
pendulum governed

258
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,359
clock

259
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,838
and even figured out how to build one

260
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,839
which is keeps perfect time except it

261
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,920
didn't work but he had the mathematical

262
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,079
structure for it how well known as

263
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:32,319
huygens oh very well known should i be

264
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,399
should i know him well yes you should

265
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,720
interesting you should definitely know

266
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,600
him no no no no no can we can we define

267
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,480
should here okay because i don't

268
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,480
right

269
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,519
um so uh so this should like uh

270
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
uh

271
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,720
yeah can you define should

272
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,920
should means this

273
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,839
um

274
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,759
if you had taken up to a second year of

275
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,000
physics courses you should you would

276
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,000
have heard his name because one of the

277
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,200
fundamental principles and optics is

278
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,240
called huygens principle

279
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,320
okay okay yeah so i have and i have i

280
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,919
heard his name there you go no but i

281
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,680
don't remember but you don't remember so

282
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:12,838
i mean there's there's a very different

283
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,838
thing

284
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,839
between names attached to principles and

285
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,000
laws and so on that you sometimes let go

286
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,839
of you just remember the equations of

287
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,240
the principles themselves and the

288
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,640
personalities of science and there's

289
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,399
certain personalities certain human

290
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,439
beings that stand out

291
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,480
and that's why there is a sense to which

292
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
the lone inventor the lone scientist is

293
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,519
the way

294
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,959
i personally mean i think a lot of

295
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:42,159
people think about the history of

296
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:44,559
science is these lone geniuses without

297
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:47,120
them the senses if you remove newton

298
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:48,319
from the picture if you remove galileo

299
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,320
from the picture

300
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,760
then science would

301
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,920
there's almost a feeling like it would

302
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:55,679
just have stopped there

303
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,958
or at the very least

304
00:11:55,679 --> 00:11:58,559
there's a feeling like it would take

305
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,039
much longer to develop the things that

306
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:03,679
were developed is that a silly way to

307
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:07,039
look at the history that's not entirely

308
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:08,958
incorrect i suppose um

309
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,838
i

310
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:15,039
find it difficult to believe that had

311
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:18,160
galileo not existed that eventually

312
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:20,399
someone like huygens for instance given

313
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,360
the context of the times

314
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,679
what was floating around

315
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,839
in the belief structure concerning the

316
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:31,120
nature of the world and so on the

317
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:33,360
developments in mathematics and whatnot

318
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,278
that sooner or later

319
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,720
whether it would have been exactly the

320
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:43,120
same or not i cannot say but would

321
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,120
things have evolved yes

322
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,359
if we look at the long arc of history of

323
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,759
science

324
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,440
from from uh back when we were in the

325
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:55,838
caves

326
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,160
trying to knock two rocks together

327
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:00,320
or maybe make a basic tool

328
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:00,319
to

329
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,480
a long time from now many centuries from

330
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:06,958
now when human civilization finally

331
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,560
destroys itself if you look at that

332
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,958
history

333
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,159
and imagine you're a historian

334
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,239
at the end

335
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,000
like with the fire of the apocalypse

336
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,159
coming upon us

337
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,159
and you look back at this time in the

338
00:13:18,159 --> 00:13:23,278
21st century how far along are we on

339
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:24,958
that arc

340
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,559
do you do you sense

341
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,399
have we invented and discovered

342
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,838
everything that's to be discovered or

343
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,799
are we at like below one percent

344
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,320
well

345
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,799
you're going to get a lot of absurd

346
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,879
questions today i apologize it's a

347
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,479
lugubrious picture you're

348
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:41,919
painting there i don't even know what

349
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,560
the word

350
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:46,399
is but i love it

351
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:48,719
well um

352
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,480
let me try and separate the question of

353
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,480
whether we're all going to die in an

354
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,600
apocalypse in several hundred years or

355
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
not

356
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,639
um

357
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,759
from the question of where science may

358
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,120
be sitting take this consumption

359
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:02,480
okay

360
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,720
um

361
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,759
i find that hard to say

362
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,839
and i find it hard to say

363
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,198
because

364
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:16,240
in the deepest sense of the term

365
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:20,078
as it's usually deployed by philosophers

366
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,680
of science today i'm not fundamentally a

367
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,278
realist that is to say i think our

368
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:26,078
access

369
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:26,958
to

370
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:28,638
the

371
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:32,719
inner workings

372
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:35,039
of nature is inevitably mediated

373
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,079
by what we can do

374
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:37,919
with

375
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:40,479
the materials

376
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,039
and factors around us we can probe

377
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,278
things in various ways does that mean

378
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:47,198
that i don't think that the

379
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:50,159
you know the standard model in quantum

380
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:52,000
electrodynamics is in of course not

381
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:54,879
uh i wouldn't even dream of saying such

382
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:57,278
a thing it can do a lot

383
00:14:54,879 --> 00:15:00,480
especially when it comes to figuring out

384
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:02,720
what's happening in very large expensive

385
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,480
particle accelerators

386
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,278
and applying results in cosmology and so

387
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,959
on as well

388
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:15,759
do i think that we have inevitably

389
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,518
probed the depths of reality through

390
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,600
this i do not agree with stephen

391
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,078
weinberg who thinks we have

392
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:24,720
about such things

393
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,879
do i on the other hand think that

394
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:29,759
the way in which science has been moving

395
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:32,320
for the last 100 years physics in

396
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:35,600
particular is what i have in mind

397
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:37,839
uh will continue on the same course

398
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,759
in that sense i don't because we're not

399
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,160
going to be building bigger and bigger

400
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,560
and more and more expensive

401
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:46,319
machines to rip apart particles in

402
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:48,239
various ways

403
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,399
in which case what are physicists going

404
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,799
to do they'll turn their attention to

405
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,519
other aspects there are all sorts of

406
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:58,078
things we've never explained

407
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,600
about the material world we don't have

408
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:01,679
theories that

409
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,440
go beyond a certain point for all sorts

410
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:06,000
of things

411
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,560
we can can we for example start with the

412
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,399
standard model and work our way up all

413
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,479
the way to chemical

414
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,679
transformations you can make an argument

415
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,639
about it

416
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:19,278
and you can justify things but that's in

417
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,120
chemistry that's not the way people work

418
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:23,919
they work with much higher level quantum

419
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,000
mechanical relationships and so on

420
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,159
so this notion of the deep theory to

421
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,480
explain everything

422
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,480
is

423
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,278
a

424
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,278
long-standing belief

425
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:41,519
which goes back pretty far although i

426
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,159
think it only takes its fullest form

427
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,799
sometime in towards the end of the 19th

428
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:48,719
century so maybe we just speak to that

429
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,838
you're referring to

430
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,519
a hope a dream a reality of coming up

431
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,040
with a theory of everything that

432
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,120
explains everything

433
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,360
so there's a very specific thing that

434
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,879
that currently means in physics

435
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,159
as the unification of the laws of

436
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:03,439
physics

437
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,159
but

438
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,759
i'm sure in antiquity or before it meant

439
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,400
maybe something else or is it always

440
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:13,599
about physics because i mean i think as

441
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
you've kind of implied

442
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:16,879
in physics there's a sense once you get

443
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,359
to the theory of everything you've

444
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,480
understood everything but there's a very

445
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,399
deep sense in which you've actually

446
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,480
understood not very much at all

447
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,559
you've understood at that particular

448
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,240
level how things work but you don't

449
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:30,399
understand how the abstractions on top

450
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,000
of abstractions form all the way to the

451
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,160
chemistry to the human mind and the

452
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,038
human societies and all those kinds of

453
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,919
things

454
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:40,160
so uh maybe you can speak to the theory

455
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,919
of everything in its history and and

456
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,600
comment on what the heck does that even

457
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,840
mean the theory of everything

458
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,079
well i don't think you can go back that

459
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:51,599
far with something like that maybe to

460
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:53,519
the at best to the 17th century if you

461
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:56,798
go back all the way in antiquity there

462
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:59,200
are of course discussions about

463
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,359
the nature of the world

464
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,600
but first of all

465
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,678
you have to

466
00:18:03,599 --> 00:18:09,439
have to recognize

467
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,360
that the manipulative character of

468
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,640
physics and chemistry

469
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:16,798
the probing of

470
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,320
let me put it this way

471
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:20,879
we assume

472
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:23,200
and have assumed for a long time

473
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,120
i'll come back to when in a moment

474
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,279
that if i take

475
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,839
a little device which is really

476
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,798
complicatedly made out of all kinds of

477
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,240
things

478
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:36,720
and i put a piece of some material in it

479
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,359
and i monkey around with it and do all

480
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,759
kinds of unnatural things to it things

481
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:44,079
that wouldn't happen

482
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,879
and i find out how it behaves and what

483
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:49,519
not and then i try and make an argument

484
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,799
about how that really applies even in

485
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:55,679
the natural world without any artificial

486
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,918
structures and so on that's not a belief

487
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:01,038
that was widely held

488
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,480
by pretty much anyone until sometime

489
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:07,359
maybe in the 1500s and when it was first

490
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,880
held it was held by people we now call

491
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,199
alchemists

492
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,720
so alchemy was the first the early days

493
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,960
of the theory of everything of a dream

494
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,360
of a theory of everything i would put it

495
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:20,079
a little differently i think it's more

496
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:23,558
along the way a dream

497
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:26,879
that by probing nature in

498
00:19:23,558 --> 00:19:32,079
artificially constructed ways we can

499
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,080
find out what's going on deep down there

500
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,000
so that was that's distinct from science

501
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:40,720
being an observing thing where you

502
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,119
observe nature and you study nature

503
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,600
you're talking about probing like

504
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,519
messing with nature to understand it

505
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:51,279
indeed i am and but that of course is

506
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:53,440
the very essence of experimental science

507
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:56,160
you have to

508
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,798
you have to manipulate nature

509
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,880
to find out things about it and then you

510
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:01,839
have to convince

511
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,200
others

512
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:07,359
that you haven't so manipulated it that

513
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,640
what you've done is to produce what

514
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,519
amounts to

515
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,038
fake artifactual behavior that doesn't

516
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:14,720
really hold

517
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:17,759
purely naturally

518
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,360
so where are we today in your sense

519
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,400
to jump around a little bit with the

520
00:20:19,359 --> 00:20:24,399
theory of everything okay maybe a a

521
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:27,440
quick kind of uh

522
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,798
sense you have about the journey

523
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,679
in the world of physics that we're

524
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,480
taking towards the theory of everything

525
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,720
well

526
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,558
i'm of course not a practicing physicist

527
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,600
i mean i was trained in physics at

528
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:41,440
princeton a long time ago until thomas

529
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,279
coons stole you away

530
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,279
more or less i was taking graduate

531
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,839
courses in those days in general

532
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:49,759
relativity i was an undergraduate but i

533
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:50,879
moved up and then i took a course with

534
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,599
him and

535
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,080
well you made the mistake of uh being

536
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:57,759
compelled by charismatic philosophers

537
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:59,918
and never looked back

538
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,839
i suppose so in a way

539
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,679
and um

540
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:06,879
from what i understand talking

541
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,159
especially to my friends at caltech

542
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,919
uh

543
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,559
like kip thorne

544
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:15,120
and others the um

545
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:18,319
the fundamental notion is that actually

546
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:20,479
the laws that even at the deepest level

547
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:22,000
we can

548
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,038
sort of divine

549
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,319
and work with in the universe that we

550
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,960
inhabit

551
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:32,000
are perhaps quite unique

552
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,640
to this particular universe as it formed

553
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,798
at the big bang

554
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,360
the question is

555
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,918
how deep does it go

556
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,798
if you are very mathematically inclined

557
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,400
the prevailing notion for

558
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,519
several decades now has been what's

559
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,640
called string theory

560
00:21:49,519 --> 00:21:51,918
but

561
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,440
that has not

562
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,400
been able to

563
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,038
figure a way to generate

564
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,480
probative experimental evidence although

565
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:02,960
it's pretty good apparently at

566
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,159
accommodating things

567
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,480
and

568
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,720
then the question is you know what's

569
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,558
before the big bang or actually the word

570
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,480
before doesn't mean anything given the

571
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:15,119
nature of time but

572
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,319
but um

573
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:20,558
why the why do we have the laws that

574
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:23,359
prevail in our universe

575
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:26,240
well there is a notion that those laws

576
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,240
prevail in our universe

577
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,558
because if they didn't we wouldn't be

578
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,798
here

579
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,879
that's a bit of a cyclical but uh

580
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,038
nevertheless a compelling definition and

581
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,080
there's all kinds of things like

582
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,240
the

583
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,000
it seems like the unification of those

584
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,759
laws could be discovered by looking

585
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,119
inside of a black hole because you get

586
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,359
both the general relativity and the

587
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:48,879
quantum mechanics quantum field theory

588
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,719
in there

589
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,880
uh experimentally of course there's a

590
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,880
lot of interesting ideas we can't really

591
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,000
look close to the big bang can look that

592
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,720
far back

593
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,038
this caltech and mit will lie go look

594
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:03,120
into gravitational waves perhaps allows

595
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:04,720
us to march backwards and so on yeah

596
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:06,000
it's really exciting space and there's

597
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,798
of course

598
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,200
the theory of everything like with a lot

599
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,798
of things in science captivates the

600
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,960
dreams of those who are perhaps

601
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:17,599
completely outside of science it's the

602
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:19,200
dream of discovering the key to how the

603
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,279
you know the nature of

604
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,200
how everything works

605
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:25,440
and that feels uh

606
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,519
that feels deeply human

607
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,640
that's perhaps the thing the

608
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,119
the basic

609
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,679
elements of what makes up a scientist in

610
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,839
the end is that curiosity that longing

611
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,840
to understand

612
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:41,038
let me ask you mentioned a disagreement

613
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,960
with weinberg on

614
00:23:41,038 --> 00:23:45,839
reality

615
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,880
could you elaborate a little bit

616
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,038
well i

617
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,760
obviously i don't disagree with steve

618
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:54,558
weinberg on physics itself i wouldn't

619
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:56,079
know enough to even begin to do that

620
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:58,720
and clearly you know he's one of the

621
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:00,960
founders of the standard model and so on

622
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,519
and it works

623
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,640
to a level of accuracy that no physical

624
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:10,720
theory has ever worked at before

625
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,480
i suppose the question in my mind is

626
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,720
something that

627
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:17,440
in one way could go back to the

628
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:22,240
philosopher immanuel kunt in the 18th

629
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,320
century namely can we really ever

630
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,240
convince ourselves

631
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:28,000
that we have

632
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,319
come to grips

633
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,400
with something that is

634
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,599
not in itself

635
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,880
knowable

636
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,278
to us

637
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,120
by our senses

638
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:43,519
or even except in the most remote way

639
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,399
through the complex instruments that we

640
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,720
make

641
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:49,038
as to what it is that underlies

642
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,360
everything can we corral it

643
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:53,359
with mathematics and experimental

644
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:57,119
structures yes

645
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:58,798
uh do i think that a particular way of

646
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,918
corralling nature

647
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:03,359
will inevitably play itself out

648
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,960
i don't know

649
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,119
it always has

650
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,480
i'll put it to you that way

651
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,798
um

652
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,120
so the basic question is

653
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:15,038
can we

654
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,879
no

655
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:19,119
reality

656
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,320
is that the the con question is that the

657
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,719
weinberg

658
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:26,558
question

659
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:27,600
we humans okay with our brains right can

660
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:29,678
we

661
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:31,038
comprehend reality

662
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,120
sounds like a very trippy question

663
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:37,119
because a lot of it rests on definitions

664
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:39,599
of uh no and comprehend and reality but

665
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:42,319
get to the bottom of it

666
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:45,278
like it's it's turtles on top of turtles

667
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:49,200
can we get to the bottom turtle

668
00:25:45,278 --> 00:25:51,038
well i say hello uh maybe i could um

669
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,600
put it to you this way

670
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:56,879
in uh

671
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,959
a way that i we often i often begin

672
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,360
discussions in a class on

673
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,519
uh the history of

674
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,599
science and so on

675
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,038
and say i'm looking at you

676
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,278
yes

677
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:11,440
um you are in fact a figment of my

678
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,759
imagination

679
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,320
you have a messed up imagination yes

680
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:19,519
well what do i mean by that

681
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,918
if i were a dragonfly

682
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:27,038
looking at you

683
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:28,720
whatever my nervous system would form

684
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:30,960
by way of

685
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,558
a perceptual structure

686
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,159
would is clearly be utterly different

687
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:37,599
from what

688
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,400
my brain

689
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:41,519
and perceptual system altogether is

690
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,559
forming

691
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,558
when i look at you

692
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:47,440
who's right

693
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,519
is it me or the dragonfly

694
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,000
well the dragonfly is certainly very

695
00:26:55,759 --> 00:27:01,839
impressive so i don't know but yes it's

696
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,839
uh the observer matters

697
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,278
well how does what is that supposed to

698
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,120
tell us about objective reality well i

699
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,960
think it means that

700
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:16,719
it's very difficult to get beyond

701
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:20,960
the constructs

702
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:24,240
that our perceptual system is leading us

703
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,519
to when we make apparatus and devices

704
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,519
and so on we're still making things

705
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,798
the results of which are the outputs of

706
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,679
which we process perceptually in various

707
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,639
ways

708
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:38,798
and an analogy i like to use with the

709
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,399
students sometimes is this all right

710
00:27:38,798 --> 00:27:42,480
they all have their laptops open in

711
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:45,519
front of them of course okay

712
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,360
and um i've sent them

713
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,839
something to read

714
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:52,158
and i say okay click on it and open it

715
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,519
up so pdf opens up i said what are you

716
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,278
looking at

717
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:56,960
i said well i'm looking at you know the

718
00:27:55,278 --> 00:27:58,960
paper that you sent me

719
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,200
i said no you're not

720
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,440
what you're looking at is a stream of

721
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,640
light coming off leds or lcds coming off

722
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,200
a screen

723
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,000
and and i said what happens when you use

724
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,159
your mouse and move that

725
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,839
fake piece of paper on the screen around

726
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,600
what are you doing you're not moving a

727
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,240
piece of paper around are you you're

728
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:22,959
moving a construct around

729
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,839
a construct that's being processed so

730
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,278
that our perceptual system can interact

731
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:32,319
with it in the way we interact with

732
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:34,720
pieces of paper yes but it's not

733
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:34,720
real

734
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:38,240
so

735
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,319
are there things outside the reach of

736
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,919
science

737
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:43,359
can you maybe

738
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,679
as an example

739
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:49,678
talk about consciousness i'm asking for

740
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,679
a friend trying to figure this thing out

741
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:55,439
well boy i mean i i

742
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:56,639
i read a fair bit about that but i

743
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,320
certainly don't

744
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,320
can't really say much about it

745
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,799
i'm a materialist

746
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,278
in the deepest sense of the term i don't

747
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:11,918
think there is anything out there

748
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,038
except material structures which

749
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:16,559
interact

750
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:19,119
in various ways do i think for example

751
00:29:16,558 --> 00:29:22,000
that this bottle of water is conscious

752
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:23,759
no i do not

753
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,640
although how would i know i can't talk

754
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:27,440
to it

755
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,360
yeah but so what do it's a hypothesis

756
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:31,679
you have it's an opinion an educated

757
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,359
opinion that may be very wrong well i

758
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,640
know that you're conscious because i can

759
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,000
interact directly with you but am i

760
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,880
well unless you're a figment of my

761
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,440
imagination of course nor or i'm a robot

762
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,480
that's able to generate the illusion uh

763
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,640
yes the illusion of consciousness

764
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,319
effectively enough to facilitate a good

765
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,759
conversation because we humans do want

766
00:29:50,319 --> 00:29:53,519
to pretend that we're talking to other

767
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,960
conscious beings that's how we respect

768
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:56,879
them if it's not conscious we don't

769
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,399
respect them we're not good at talking

770
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,559
to robots that's true of course we

771
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,079
generalize from our own inner sense

772
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:04,319
which is the kind of thing descartes

773
00:30:02,079 --> 00:30:08,558
said uh from the beginning and we

774
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:10,879
generalize from that but i do think that

775
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:13,839
consciousness must be

776
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,840
something whatever it is that occurs as

777
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:19,439
a result of some particular

778
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,839
organizational structure of

779
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:24,159
material

780
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,278
elements does materialism mean that it's

781
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,240
all within

782
00:30:25,278 --> 00:30:30,480
within the reach of science

783
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,880
my sense would be that

784
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:35,278
especially as

785
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,760
neuroscience

786
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:40,720
progresses more and more and at caltech

787
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:43,759
we just built a whole neuroscience

788
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,558
arena and so on and as

789
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,759
more knowledge is gained about the ways

790
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:49,038
in which

791
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:50,480
animals

792
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:53,759
when they behave

793
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,159
what patterns show up at various parts

794
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:58,720
of the brain and nervous system

795
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,480
and perhaps extending it to humans

796
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,880
eventually as well

797
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:07,599
we'll get more of a handle

798
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,640
on what brain activity is associated

799
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:10,959
with

800
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,159
uh experiences

801
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:15,200
that

802
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:18,880
we have as humans can we move from the

803
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,840
brain activity to the experiences

804
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,880
in terms of our person no you can't

805
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:27,439
perception is perception

806
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,799
that's the hypothesis once again

807
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,720
maybe maybe the

808
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:34,079
maybe consciousness is just one of the

809
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,278
laws of physics that's yet to be

810
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:37,759
discovered

811
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,599
maybe it permeates all matter

812
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,359
maybe it's

813
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:42,879
maybe it's as simple as trying to plug

814
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,319
it in and um

815
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,320
plug into

816
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:49,359
the ability to generate and control that

817
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,558
kind of law of physics that would crack

818
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,719
open

819
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,158
where we would understand that the wa

820
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,919
that the bottled water is in fact

821
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:58,000
conscious just much less conscious than

822
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,480
us humans and then we would be able to

823
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,079
then generate uh beings that are more

824
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,759
conscious

825
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:06,398
well that'll be unfortunate i'd have to

826
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:08,558
stop drinking the water after that

827
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:10,158
every time you take it take a sip

828
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,319
there's a little bit of a

829
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:14,799
suffering going on right

830
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:16,398
what to use the most

831
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:19,440
interesting beautiful moments in the

832
00:32:16,398 --> 00:32:22,079
history of science what stands out right

833
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,278
and then we can pull at that thread

834
00:32:22,079 --> 00:32:25,918
right

835
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:28,960
well i like to think of

836
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,480
events that have

837
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,558
a major impact and involve both

838
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,240
beautiful

839
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:37,759
conceptual

840
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,440
mathematical

841
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:42,319
if we're talking physical structures

842
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,600
work and are associated as well with

843
00:32:42,319 --> 00:32:44,960
probing

844
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,639
experimental

845
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,159
situations

846
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,519
so um among my favorites is one of the

847
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,760
most famous

848
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,240
which was the young isaac newton's

849
00:32:55,759 --> 00:33:01,200
with the colors produced when you pass

850
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,759
sunlight through a prism

851
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,038
and why do i like that

852
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:09,919
it's not profoundly mathematical in one

853
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:12,720
sense it doesn't need it initially it

854
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,080
needs the following though which begins

855
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,000
to show you i think a little bit about

856
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:18,000
what gets involved when you've got a

857
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,398
smart individual who's trying to monkey

858
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,159
around with stuff and finds new things

859
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,158
about it

860
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,519
first let me say that the the notion the

861
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,159
prevailing notion going back to

862
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,960
antiquity was that um

863
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,200
colors are produced in a sense by

864
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,079
modifying or tinting

865
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,558
white light that they're modifications

866
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:41,839
of white light in other words the colors

867
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,519
are not in the sunlight in any way

868
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:44,480
okay

869
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:47,038
now

870
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,200
what newton did following experiments

871
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,038
done by descartes before him who came to

872
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,840
very different conclusions

873
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:55,679
he took a prism

874
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:58,639
you might ask where do you get prisms in

875
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,038
the you know 1660s

876
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,120
county fairs they were very popular they

877
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:05,038
were pretty crude with bubbles in them

878
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:06,879
and everything but they produced colors

879
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:08,639
so you could buy them at county fairs

880
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,320
and things very popular oh so they were

881
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,240
modifying the white light

882
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,960
well to create colors they were

883
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,000
creating colors from it well known

884
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,720
um

885
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,440
and what he did was the following he was

886
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,838
by this time even though he's very young

887
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:26,320
a very good mathematician

888
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,639
and he could use the

889
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,559
then known laws for how light behaves

890
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,960
when it goes through glass

891
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:35,599
to calculate what should happen

892
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,559
if you took light from the sun passed it

893
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,240
from a hole through a little hole

894
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,480
then hit the prism

895
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,559
goes out of the prism goes strikes a

896
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,639
wall a long distance away and makes a

897
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,719
splash of light never mind the colors

898
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,039
for a moment makes a splash of light

899
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,319
there he was very smart

900
00:34:51,039 --> 00:34:55,599
first of all

901
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,639
he abstracts from the colors themselves

902
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,200
even though that's what everybody's

903
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,880
paying attention to initially

904
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:04,319
and because what he knows is this he

905
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,400
knows that if you take this prism

906
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,800
and you turn it to a certain particular

907
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,480
angle that he knew

908
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,720
what it should be because he could

909
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,480
calculate things and

910
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:16,879
very few other people in europe at the

911
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,000
time could calculate things like he

912
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,920
could

913
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,679
that if you turn the prism to that

914
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,599
particular angle

915
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,199
then the sun which is of course a circle

916
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:29,599
when its light passes through this

917
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:32,319
little hole and then into the prism on

918
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:35,359
the far distant wall

919
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,519
should still make a circle

920
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:40,880
but it doesn't

921
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,639
it makes a very long image okay

922
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,880
and this

923
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,799
led him to a very different conception

924
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,440
of light indicating that there are

925
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,320
different types of light in the sunlight

926
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,400
now

927
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,720
to go beyond that what's particularly

928
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,880
interesting i think is the following

929
00:35:54,719 --> 00:36:01,118
when he published uh this paper which

930
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,039
got him into a controversy

931
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,079
he really didn't describe it all what he

932
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,838
did he just gave you some numbers

933
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,039
now i just told you that you had to set

934
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:13,838
this prism at a certain angle right

935
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:15,838
you would think because we do have his

936
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:18,320
notes and so on

937
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:21,199
um you would think that he took some

938
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:23,200
kind of complicated measuring device to

939
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,039
set the prism he didn't

940
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:28,399
he held it in his hand

941
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:31,679
that's all and he twiddled it around

942
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:34,240
and what was he doing it turns out

943
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:36,399
that when you twiddle the prism around

944
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,399
at the point where you should get a

945
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,960
circle from a circle

946
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,838
it also is the place where the image

947
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,480
does not move very fast so if you want

948
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:50,960
to get close to there you just twiddle

949
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,639
it this is manipulative experimentation

950
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,760
taking advantage through his

951
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:59,519
mathematical knowledge

952
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:02,839
of the inherent inaccuracies that label

953
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:06,639
let you come to exact conclusions

954
00:37:02,838 --> 00:37:09,440
regardless of the built-in problematics

955
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:12,639
of measurement he's the only one i know

956
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,838
of doing anything like that at the time

957
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,838
yeah

958
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:17,920
well even still there's very few people

959
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:21,199
that are able to have to calculate as

960
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,599
well as he did to be a theoretician

961
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:26,239
and an experimentalist

962
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:30,160
like in the same moment

963
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:31,919
right um it's it's true although until

964
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,519
uh the um

965
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,039
really the

966
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,880
well into the 20th century

967
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,159
maybe the beginning of the 20th century

968
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,800
really

969
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:45,039
most of the most significant

970
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,519
experimental results

971
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:49,599
produced in the 1800s

972
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:53,519
which laid the foundations for light

973
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,920
electricity electrodynamics and so on

974
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,000
even

975
00:37:54,920 --> 00:38:00,960
hydrodynamics and whatnot were also

976
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,838
produced by people who are both

977
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,480
excellent

978
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:07,519
calculators uh

979
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,280
very talented mathematicians and good

980
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:11,280
with their hands experimentally

981
00:38:11,358 --> 00:38:16,480
and then that led to the 21st century

982
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,720
with enrico from me that uh

983
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,480
one of the one of the last people that

984
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,480
was able to do that

985
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,599
both of those things very well and that

986
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,679
uh

987
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:27,280
he built a little device called an

988
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,078
atomic bomb

989
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,079
that has some positives and negatives

990
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:34,079
right of course that actually did

991
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,240
involve some pretty large-scale

992
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,280
elaborate equipment too yeah while

993
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:38,879
holding a

994
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,119
prism in your hands

995
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:43,838
right no what uh what's the controversy

996
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:45,760
that you got into with that paper when

997
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:47,440
you published it

998
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:50,480
well i th

999
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,880
in a number of ways it's a complicated

1000
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:55,199
story there was a

1001
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,079
very talented character

1002
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,919
known as a mechanic mechanic means

1003
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,320
somebody who was a craftsman who could

1004
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,159
build and make really good stuff and he

1005
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:05,039
was very talented his name was robert

1006
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:07,039
hook

1007
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,039
and he was the guy who

1008
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:11,039
at the weekly meetings of the royal

1009
00:39:09,039 --> 00:39:13,039
society in london and newton's not in

1010
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:15,599
london you know he's at cambridge a

1011
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:18,320
young guy he would demonstrate new

1012
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,480
things and he was very clever

1013
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,200
and he had written a book in fact called

1014
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,400
the micrographia which by the way he

1015
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:25,838
used a

1016
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,240
microscope

1017
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:30,880
to make the first depictions of things

1018
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,118
like a fly's eye the structure of you

1019
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,599
know it had a big influence and in there

1020
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,280
he also talked about light and so he had

1021
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:38,720
a different view of light when he read

1022
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,440
what newton was

1023
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:44,639
wrote he had a double reaction on the

1024
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,119
one hand he said anything in there that

1025
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:48,480
is correct i already knew

1026
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,800
and anything

1027
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,679
that i didn't already know is probably

1028
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,680
not right anyway

1029
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,000
i gotta love egos okay can you uh can we

1030
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:02,480
just step back can you say

1031
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,239
who was isaac newton

1032
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:08,400
what are the things he contributed to

1033
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,399
this world in the space of ideas

1034
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:13,599
wow uh

1035
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,280
who was he

1036
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:16,640
he was born

1037
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,880
in

1038
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:20,000
1642

1039
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,000
in

1040
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,519
and near the small town of grantham in

1041
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,079
england

1042
00:40:23,519 --> 00:40:28,079
in fact the house he was born in

1043
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,280
and that his mother died in is still

1044
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,280
there and can be visited

1045
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,599
his father died

1046
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,160
before he was born

1047
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,280
and his mother eventually remarried

1048
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:45,838
uh a man named reverend smith whom

1049
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,280
newton did not like

1050
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:48,239
at all

1051
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,200
uh

1052
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:54,318
because reverend smith took his mother

1053
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,000
away to live with him a few miles away

1054
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,838
leaving newton to be brought up more or

1055
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,920
less by his grandmother

1056
00:40:57,838 --> 00:41:01,358
over there and he had huge resentment

1057
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,880
about that his

1058
00:41:01,358 --> 00:41:04,880
whole life

1059
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,318
i think that gives you a little inkling

1060
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,838
that a little bit of trauma in childhood

1061
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,480
maybe a complicated father-son

1062
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,920
relationship can be useful uh to create

1063
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,358
a good scientist

1064
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,639
could be although this case it would be

1065
00:41:15,358 --> 00:41:20,480
right the you know

1066
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:23,039
absent father non-father relationship

1067
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:27,119
he was known as a kid little that we do

1068
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:29,039
know for uh being very clever about uh

1069
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,760
flying kites and

1070
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:33,358
uh there are stories about him putting

1071
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,680
candles and putting

1072
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:37,598
flying kites and scaring the living

1073
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,078
devil out of people at night by doing

1074
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,200
that and things like that making things

1075
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:43,200
most of the uh

1076
00:41:43,358 --> 00:41:46,719
physicists and

1077
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,160
natural philosophers i've dealt with

1078
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:51,199
actually

1079
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,719
as children were very fond of making and

1080
00:41:51,199 --> 00:41:54,480
playing with things

1081
00:41:52,719 --> 00:41:55,358
i can't think of one i know of who

1082
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:57,679
wasn't

1083
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:59,838
actually they're very good with their

1084
00:41:57,679 --> 00:42:03,399
hands and whatnot

1085
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:03,400
he uh

1086
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:06,639
was

1087
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,039
his mother wanted him to take over the

1088
00:42:06,639 --> 00:42:11,039
manor it was a kind of farming manner

1089
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:12,159
they were the class of what are known as

1090
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:13,679
yeomans

1091
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:15,440
there are stories that he wasn't very

1092
00:42:13,679 --> 00:42:17,279
good at that

1093
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,358
one day one of the stories is he's

1094
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,680
sitting out in the field and the cows

1095
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:23,679
come home without him and he doesn't

1096
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:24,559
know what's going anyway

1097
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:26,719
i

1098
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:28,960
had relatives and

1099
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:31,039
he manages to get to cambridge sent to

1100
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,358
cambridge because he's known to be smart

1101
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:36,159
he's read books that he got from local

1102
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:38,078
dignitaries and some relatives

1103
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:40,239
uh and he goes there as what's known as

1104
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:42,079
a sub-sizer what does that mean well

1105
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:45,439
it's not too pleasant basically a

1106
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:47,680
sub-sizer was a student who had to clean

1107
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,200
the bedpans of the richer kids

1108
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:51,039
okay right

1109
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:53,598
that didn't last too long

1110
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:55,838
he makes his way

1111
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:59,519
and he becomes absorbed

1112
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:01,199
in some of the new ways of thinking that

1113
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,838
are being talked about

1114
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:05,519
on the parts of descartes and others as

1115
00:43:03,838 --> 00:43:08,078
well there's also the traditional

1116
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,358
curriculum which he follows and we have

1117
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:11,760
his notes

1118
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:14,799
we have his student notebooks and so on

1119
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,839
we can see gradually this young man's

1120
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,720
mind

1121
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,960
focusing and coming to grips with

1122
00:43:18,719 --> 00:43:24,000
deeper questions of the nature of the

1123
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,039
world and perception even and how we

1124
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,639
know things and also probing and

1125
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:30,639
learning uh

1126
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,759
mathematical structures to such an

1127
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:35,759
extent that he builds on

1128
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,040
some of the investigations that had been

1129
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,040
done in this

1130
00:43:37,039 --> 00:43:42,480
period before him to create the

1131
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:45,400
foundations of a way of investigating

1132
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:48,240
processes that happen and change

1133
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,720
continuously instead of by leaps and

1134
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:53,358
bounds and so on forming the foundation

1135
00:43:50,719 --> 00:43:54,719
of what we now call the calculus yeah

1136
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:56,318
so

1137
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:58,879
can you maybe just paint a little bit of

1138
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:01,119
a picture you've already started

1139
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,119
of

1140
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,719
what were the things that bothered him

1141
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:07,199
the most

1142
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:08,719
that stood out to him

1143
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,159
the most about the traditional

1144
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,318
curriculum

1145
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:14,719
about the way people saw the world you

1146
00:44:12,318 --> 00:44:16,559
mentioned discrete versus continuous is

1147
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,799
there something where he began thinking

1148
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:22,480
in a revolutionary way it's because it's

1149
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,318
fascinating most of us go to college uh

1150
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,599
cambridge or otherwise

1151
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:28,960
and we just kind of take what we hear

1152
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,079
as gospel

1153
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:35,838
right like not gospel but um

1154
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,920
as like facts you don't begin to sort of

1155
00:44:35,838 --> 00:44:39,679
see how can i expand on this

1156
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,519
aggressively your heart how can i

1157
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:42,960
challenge everything

1158
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:45,679
that i hear

1159
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,760
like rigorously mathematically

1160
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:49,759
through the i mean i don't even know how

1161
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,440
how rigorous the mathematics was at that

1162
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,200
point i'm sure it was

1163
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,679
geometry and so on no calculus huh

1164
00:44:55,199 --> 00:45:00,799
there are elements of what turned into

1165
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:02,480
the calculus that predate newton but how

1166
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,800
much how much rigor was there how much

1167
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,838
uh well rigor no

1168
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,720
and then of course no scientific method

1169
00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:13,279
not really i mean somewhat like

1170
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,439
i mean appreciation of data

1171
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,920
ah that is a separate question from a

1172
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,838
question of method appreciation of data

1173
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,599
is a significant question

1174
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:24,318
as to what you do with data there's lots

1175
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:26,318
of things you're asking i apologize so

1176
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:27,920
maybe let's backtrack and the first

1177
00:45:26,318 --> 00:45:31,440
question is was there something that was

1178
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:34,400
bothering him that he especially

1179
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,559
thought he could contribute or work on

1180
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,480
well of course we can't go back and talk

1181
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,799
to him but we do have these student

1182
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:43,119
notebooks there's two of them

1183
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,200
one's called the philosophical questions

1184
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:47,119
and the other is called the waste book

1185
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:49,838
the philosophical questions has

1186
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,519
discussions of the nature of reality and

1187
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,920
various issues concerning it and the

1188
00:45:51,519 --> 00:45:56,719
wastebook has things that have to do

1189
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,440
with motion in various ways what happens

1190
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,000
in

1191
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,480
collisions and things of that sort and

1192
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,760
it's a complicated story but what's

1193
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,880
among the things that i think are

1194
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,599
interesting is he took notes in the

1195
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:13,039
philosophical questions on stuff that

1196
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,039
was traditionally

1197
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:20,000
given to you in the curriculums going

1198
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:23,119
back several hundred years namely on

1199
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:24,960
what uh scholars refer to as scholastic

1200
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,280
or neo-scholastic

1201
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:29,440
ways of thinking about the world

1202
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,760
dating back to the reformulation of

1203
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,039
aristotle in the middle ages by thomas

1204
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,720
aquinas in the church this is a totally

1205
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:38,239
different way of thinking about things

1206
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:42,318
which actually connects to something we

1207
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:44,559
were saying a moment ago for instance um

1208
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:45,440
so i'm wearing a blue shirt

1209
00:46:44,559 --> 00:46:48,000
and

1210
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,838
i will sometimes ask students where is

1211
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,119
the blue

1212
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:52,078
and they'll usually so it's in your

1213
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:53,680
shirt

1214
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,160
and then some they'll get clear and they

1215
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:58,318
say well no you know light is striking

1216
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:01,118
it photons are re-emitted they strike

1217
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:02,239
the back of your retina and etc etc and

1218
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,358
i said yes

1219
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:07,039
you what that means is that the blue

1220
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:10,078
is actually

1221
00:47:07,039 --> 00:47:11,599
an artifact of our perceptual system

1222
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,760
considered as

1223
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:17,280
the percept of blue

1224
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:20,079
it's not out there it's in here yeah

1225
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,040
right that's not how things were thought

1226
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,640
about

1227
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,599
well into the 16th century the general

1228
00:47:24,639 --> 00:47:27,759
notion

1229
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,640
dating back even to aristotelian

1230
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,480
antiquity and formalized by the 12th

1231
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,639
century

1232
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,318
at the paris

1233
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:41,199
oxford and elsewhere is that qualities

1234
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:43,358
are there in the world

1235
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:45,838
they're not in us

1236
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:46,880
we have senses and our senses can be

1237
00:47:45,838 --> 00:47:48,960
wrong

1238
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:49,920
you know you could go blind things like

1239
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:52,400
that

1240
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,720
but if they're working properly

1241
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:57,358
you get the actual qualities of the

1242
00:47:54,719 --> 00:47:58,239
world now that break

1243
00:47:57,358 --> 00:47:59,920
which is

1244
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,000
occurring

1245
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,800
towards the end of the 16th century and

1246
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,358
is most visible in descartes

1247
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:10,800
is the break between conceiving

1248
00:48:07,358 --> 00:48:12,159
that the qualities of the world are very

1249
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,720
different

1250
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:16,879
from the qualities that we perceive

1251
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:20,639
that in fact the qualities of the world

1252
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:23,039
consist almost entirely in shapes

1253
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:26,000
of various kinds and

1254
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,358
maybe hard particles or whatever

1255
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,400
but

1256
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:32,159
not colors not sounds

1257
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,800
not smells

1258
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:37,838
not softness and hardness they're not in

1259
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:40,559
the world they're in us

1260
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:42,159
that break newton is picking up

1261
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:44,640
as he reads descartes he's going to

1262
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:46,000
disagree with a lot in descartes but

1263
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:47,440
that break

1264
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,440
he is

1265
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,800
among other things picking up very

1266
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,119
strongly and that underlies a lot

1267
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,359
of the way he works later on when he

1268
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,400
becomes skeptical of the evidence

1269
00:48:57,358 --> 00:49:02,960
provided by the senses

1270
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,200
yeah that's that's actually i don't know

1271
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:07,519
the way you're describing is so powerful

1272
00:49:05,199 --> 00:49:10,078
this makes makes me realize how

1273
00:49:07,519 --> 00:49:11,920
liberating that is as a

1274
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,559
as a scientist as somebody who's trying

1275
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,318
to understand reality

1276
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,319
that our senses is just

1277
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:24,480
our senses are not to be trusted

1278
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,679
that reality is to be investigated

1279
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,199
through

1280
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:31,279
tools that are beyond our senses yes

1281
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:32,480
or that improve our sense improve our

1282
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,839
senses

1283
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:35,920
in some ways

1284
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,679
um that's pretty powerful for i mean

1285
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,838
that is uh

1286
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:44,199
for a human being

1287
00:49:39,838 --> 00:49:44,199
that's like einstein level

1288
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:49,039
for be for a human being to realize you

1289
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:51,598
can't tr i can't trust my own senses at

1290
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:53,838
that time

1291
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,920
that's pretty trippy

1292
00:49:53,838 --> 00:49:57,358
it's coming in it's coming in and i

1293
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,920
think it

1294
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:02,799
it arises probably you know

1295
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,760
a fair number of decades before that

1296
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,680
perhaps in part with all chemical

1297
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,599
experimentation and manipulations that

1298
00:50:07,679 --> 00:50:12,480
you have to go through elaborate

1299
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,119
structures to produce things

1300
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:16,880
and ways you think about it

1301
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,640
but let me give you an example that you

1302
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,079
know i think you might find interesting

1303
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:22,318
because it's from

1304
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:25,039
it involves that guy named hook that

1305
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:27,279
newton had an argument with

1306
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:29,838
and um he had lots of arguments with

1307
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,319
hook although hook was a very clever guy

1308
00:50:29,838 --> 00:50:34,400
and gave him some things that stimulated

1309
00:50:32,318 --> 00:50:36,960
him later anyway

1310
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:39,599
hook who was argumentative

1311
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:42,880
and he really was convinced that the

1312
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:45,599
only way to gain real knowledge

1313
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:47,039
of nature is through carefully

1314
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:50,240
constructed

1315
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:52,838
devices and he was an expert

1316
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:56,719
mechanic if you will at building such

1317
00:50:52,838 --> 00:50:59,920
things now there was a

1318
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:00,799
there was a rather wealthy man

1319
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,318
in

1320
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,200
danzig

1321
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:07,679
by the name of hevelius latinized name

1322
00:51:05,199 --> 00:51:09,838
he was a brewer in town

1323
00:51:07,679 --> 00:51:11,358
and he had become fascinated with the

1324
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:12,960
telescope

1325
00:51:11,358 --> 00:51:15,279
this is

1326
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,079
30 years or so 20 or 30 years after the

1327
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,720
telescope had moved out and become more

1328
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:25,440
common and he built a large observatory

1329
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:27,759
on the top of his uh brewery actually

1330
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:29,440
and working with his wife

1331
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:32,640
they they

1332
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:34,800
used these very uh elaborate

1333
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:36,879
reconstructed brass and metal

1334
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,200
instruments to make observations of

1335
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:41,760
positions of the stars and he published

1336
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:42,719
a whole new catalog of where the stars

1337
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,720
are

1338
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,919
and he claimed it was incredibly

1339
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:47,838
accurate

1340
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:50,159
he claimed it was so accurate that

1341
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:53,039
nothing had ever come close to it hook

1342
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:53,759
reads this and he says wait a minute

1343
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:55,759
you

1344
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,839
didn't use a telescope here of any kind

1345
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,680
because what's the point

1346
00:51:57,838 --> 00:52:02,480
unless you do something to the telescope

1347
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:04,480
all you see are dots with stars you just

1348
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:06,639
use your eye your eyes can't be that

1349
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,240
good it's impossible

1350
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:10,078
so what did hook do to prove this he

1351
00:52:08,239 --> 00:52:12,078
said what you should have done is you

1352
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:13,599
should have put a little device in the

1353
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,160
telescope that lets you measure

1354
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:18,240
distances between these dots you didn't

1355
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:21,598
do that and because you didn't there's

1356
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:21,598
no way you could have been that good

1357
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,440
at two successive meetings of the royal

1358
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:26,720
society

1359
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,838
he hauls

1360
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,679
the members out into the courtyard

1361
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:34,558
and he takes a card

1362
00:52:31,679 --> 00:52:36,719
and he makes successive black and white

1363
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:39,040
stripes on the card and he pastes the

1364
00:52:36,719 --> 00:52:40,719
card up on a wall and he takes them one

1365
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:43,358
by one he says now

1366
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:45,838
move back looking at it

1367
00:52:43,358 --> 00:52:47,759
presumably with one eye until you can't

1368
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:49,679
tell the the black ones from the white

1369
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,240
stripes he says

1370
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:55,679
that i can then measure the distance i

1371
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:59,039
can see the angles i can give a number

1372
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:02,399
then for what is the best possible

1373
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:04,079
what we would uh call perceptual acuity

1374
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,119
of human vision

1375
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:11,039
and it turned out he thought to be

1376
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:13,280
something like 10 or more times worse

1377
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,679
than this guy hevelius had claimed so

1378
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,880
obviously says hook of alias

1379
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:18,159
right well

1380
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,119
years ago

1381
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:23,759
i calculated um hevelius's numbers and

1382
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,240
so on using modern uh

1383
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,800
tables from nasa and so on and they are

1384
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:31,199
even more accurate than hevelius claimed

1385
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,880
and worse than that

1386
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:34,879
the royal society sent a young

1387
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,280
astronomer named hallie

1388
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:39,200
over to dunsig to work with him and

1389
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,559
halley writes back and he says i

1390
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,799
couldn't believe it

1391
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,640
but i could he taught me how to do it

1392
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,079
and i could get just as good as he how

1393
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:48,078
is it possible

1394
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:51,039
well here this shows you something very

1395
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,359
interesting about experiments perception

1396
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:55,599
and everything else hook was right but

1397
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:58,480
he was also wrong

1398
00:53:55,599 --> 00:54:00,480
he was wrong for the right reasons

1399
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,599
and he was right for the wrong reasons

1400
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:03,599
and what do i mean by that

1401
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:09,358
what he actually found

1402
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:11,679
was the number for what we now call 2020

1403
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:14,719
vision he was right

1404
00:54:11,679 --> 00:54:16,159
you can't tell except a few people much

1405
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:17,118
better than that

1406
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:20,719
yeah

1407
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:23,599
but he was observing the wrong thing yes

1408
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:25,598
what hevelius was observing was a bright

1409
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:26,880
dot

1410
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:30,160
a star

1411
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:33,039
moving past a pointer

1412
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:34,159
our eyes are rather similar to frog's

1413
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:36,000
eyes

1414
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:39,679
you know i'm sure you've heard the story

1415
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,280
if i hold a dead fly on a string in

1416
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:44,239
front of a frog and don't move it the

1417
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:47,599
frog pays no attention as soon as i

1418
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:50,318
move the fly the frog immediately tongue

1419
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:54,079
laptop because the visual system of the

1420
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:55,119
frog responds to motion yes so does ours

1421
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,760
and our

1422
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,680
acuity for distinguishing motion from

1423
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,359
statics

1424
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:02,639
five or more times better yeah that's

1425
00:55:01,358 --> 00:55:06,000
fascinating

1426
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:08,719
damn uh and of course

1427
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,559
i mean i maybe you can comment on

1428
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:12,078
their understanding

1429
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:14,319
of the human perceptual system at the

1430
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:16,240
time was probably really terrible

1431
00:55:14,318 --> 00:55:18,480
like yeah like i've recently been

1432
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:20,318
working with just almost as a fun side

1433
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,838
thing with vision scientists and

1434
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:24,719
peripheral vision

1435
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:26,318
it's a it's a beautiful complex mess

1436
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:28,399
that whole thing we still don't

1437
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:31,440
understand all the weird ways that human

1438
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,280
perception works and they were probably

1439
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:35,039
terrible at it

1440
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:39,119
they probably didn't have any conception

1441
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:41,599
of peripheral vision or or the fovea or

1442
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,920
or i mean basically anything

1443
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,920
they had some i mean because actually

1444
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,519
was newton himself who probed a lot of

1445
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:50,318
this for instance

1446
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:52,079
uh newton the young newton

1447
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:53,838
trying to work his way around what's

1448
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,480
going on with colors

1449
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,719
wanted to try and distinguish

1450
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,639
colors that occur through natural

1451
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:03,358
processes out there

1452
00:56:00,639 --> 00:56:04,960
and colors that are a result of our eyes

1453
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:09,199
not operating right so you know what he

1454
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:11,599
did it's a famous thing he took a stick

1455
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:14,639
and he stuck that stick under his lower

1456
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,400
eyelid and pushed up on his eyeball

1457
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:19,920
and what that did

1458
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,400
what produced colored circles

1459
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,240
at diametrically opposite positions of

1460
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,318
the stick in the eyeball and he moved it

1461
00:56:24,239 --> 00:56:29,118
around to see how they moved

1462
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:31,519
trying to distinguish legit

1463
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:34,318
right i always have to tell my students

1464
00:56:31,519 --> 00:56:37,039
don't do this but

1465
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:39,519
or do it if you want to be great

1466
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,519
and remembered by uh human history

1467
00:56:39,519 --> 00:56:43,679
that's that there's a lot of equivalent

1468
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:45,358
to sticking a stick into your eye in

1469
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:47,199
modern day that

1470
00:56:45,358 --> 00:56:48,318
may pay off in the end

1471
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:50,558
okay

1472
00:56:48,318 --> 00:56:50,558
uh

1473
00:56:51,358 --> 00:56:56,880
as a small aside is the newton and the

1474
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,838
apple story true no

1475
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,838
was it a different fruit

1476
00:57:00,239 --> 00:57:04,558
as a colleague of mine named simon

1477
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,559
shaffer in england

1478
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:08,319
once said on a nova program that we were

1479
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,559
both on

1480
00:57:08,318 --> 00:57:13,920
the role of fruit in the history of

1481
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,798
science has been vastly exaggerated

1482
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:18,639
okay

1483
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:21,838
so was there any immune to to zoom out

1484
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,838
moments of epiphany

1485
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,920
is is there something to moments of

1486
00:57:23,838 --> 00:57:28,798
epiphany or again this is the paradigm

1487
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,519
shift versus the gradualism there is a

1488
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:34,960
shift um it's a much more complex one

1489
00:57:31,519 --> 00:57:34,960
than that and we

1490
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,760
i'm

1491
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,558
as it happens a colleague of mine and i

1492
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,720
are writing a paper right now on one of

1493
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:44,079
the aspects of these things

1494
00:57:42,719 --> 00:57:46,078
based on the work that many of our

1495
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:47,839
colleagues have done over the last

1496
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,839
30 and 40 years

1497
00:57:47,838 --> 00:57:51,440
um

1498
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:53,440
let me try and see if i could put it to

1499
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,480
you this way

1500
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,639
newton

1501
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:00,039
until the

1502
00:57:56,639 --> 00:58:00,039
early 1670s

1503
00:58:00,318 --> 00:58:04,798
and probably really until a fair time

1504
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:06,879
after that

1505
00:58:04,798 --> 00:58:08,639
first of all was not very interested in

1506
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,559
questions of motion

1507
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:13,199
he was working actually

1508
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,760
in all chemical relationships or what is

1509
00:58:13,199 --> 00:58:19,039
called by historians chymistry a kind of

1510
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,799
early modern chemical structure

1511
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:23,440
colleagues of ours at indiana have even

1512
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:25,838
reproduced the amalgams that

1513
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:25,838
anyway

1514
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,559
his way of thinking about motion

1515
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:32,960
involved a certain

1516
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:34,240
set of relationships

1517
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,960
which

1518
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:38,239
was not conducive

1519
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,199
to

1520
00:58:38,239 --> 00:58:44,959
any application that would yield

1521
00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:47,279
computationally direct results

1522
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:49,119
uh for things like planetary motions

1523
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,839
which he wasn't terribly interested in

1524
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,838
anyway

1525
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:58,880
he enters the correspondence with his

1526
00:58:56,239 --> 00:59:00,558
original nemesis robert hook and hook

1527
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,640
says well have you ever thought about

1528
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,640
and then hook tells him a certain way

1529
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,798
you might think about it and when newton

1530
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:09,118
hears that

1531
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:11,759
he recognizes that there is a way to

1532
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:14,318
inject time that would enable him to

1533
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:16,000
solve certain problems

1534
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:17,519
it's not that he

1535
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,559
that there was anything he thought

1536
00:59:17,519 --> 00:59:20,639
before

1537
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:24,960
that was contrary to that way of

1538
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:27,039
thinking it's just that that particular

1539
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,960
technical insight

1540
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,199
was not something that

1541
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,519
for a lot of reasons that are complex

1542
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,598
had never occurred to him

1543
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:37,199
at all and that sent him a different way

1544
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:38,880
of thinking

1545
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:40,719
but to answer your question about the

1546
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,720
apple business which is always about you

1547
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:46,480
know gravity and the moon and all of

1548
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:48,639
that being no um the the re the reason

1549
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:50,240
there is that the idea

1550
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:51,679
that um

1551
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:54,239
what goes on

1552
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:56,960
here in the neighborhood of the earth

1553
00:59:54,239 --> 01:00:00,239
and what goes on at the moon

1554
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,358
let us say remind the sun and the planet

1555
01:00:00,239 --> 01:00:05,598
can be due to a direct relationship

1556
01:00:03,358 --> 01:00:07,119
between the earth let's say

1557
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:09,280
and the moon

1558
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:11,358
is contrary

1559
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:14,400
to fundamental

1560
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:16,078
beliefs held by many of the mechanical

1561
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:18,720
philosophers as they're called at the

1562
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:21,119
time in which everything has to involve

1563
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:23,039
at least a sequence of direct contacts

1564
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:26,400
has to be something between here and

1565
01:00:23,039 --> 01:00:29,519
there yes that's involved

1566
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:31,599
and uh hook

1567
01:00:29,519 --> 01:00:33,838
probably not thinking terribly deeply

1568
01:00:31,599 --> 01:00:35,519
about it based on what he said along

1569
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,838
with others like the architect and

1570
01:00:35,519 --> 01:00:40,000
mathematician christopher wren

1571
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:42,159
hearken back to the notion that well

1572
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,599
maybe there is a kind of magnetic

1573
01:00:42,159 --> 01:00:45,679
relationship

1574
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:48,000
between the moon and maybe the planets

1575
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:50,399
and the earth and gravity and so on

1576
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:52,318
vague but establishing a direct

1577
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:54,720
connection somehow however it's

1578
01:00:52,318 --> 01:00:56,719
happening forget about it

1579
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:58,480
newton wouldn't have cared about that if

1580
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,719
that's all they said but it was when

1581
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,798
hook mentioned this different way of

1582
01:01:00,719 --> 01:01:04,558
thinking about the motion

1583
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:07,920
a way he could certainly have thought of

1584
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:10,880
because it does not contradict anything

1585
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,240
newton is a brilliant mathematician and

1586
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:14,400
he could see

1587
01:01:12,239 --> 01:01:16,798
that you could suddenly start to do

1588
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:18,880
things with that

1589
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:20,719
that you otherwise wouldn't and this led

1590
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:23,039
eventually to another controversy with

1591
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:25,519
hook in which hook said well after

1592
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:27,679
newton published his great principia i

1593
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:29,280
gave him how to do this and then newton

1594
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,679
of course got ticked off about that and

1595
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,680
said well listen to this i did

1596
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:35,919
everything and because he had a picayune

1597
01:01:33,679 --> 01:01:37,519
little idea he thinks he can take credit

1598
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,798
for it

1599
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:40,159
okay

1600
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:42,318
uh

1601
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:44,000
so his ability to play with his ideas

1602
01:01:42,318 --> 01:01:46,558
mathematically is what solidified the

1603
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,159
initial intuition that you could have

1604
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:50,559
was that the first time he was born the

1605
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:52,399
idea that you have action at a distance

1606
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:54,559
that you can have

1607
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:57,200
forces without contact which is another

1608
01:01:54,559 --> 01:02:01,760
revolutionary idea

1609
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:03,038
i would say that in the sense of dealing

1610
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,480
with

1611
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:07,680
the mechanics of force-like

1612
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:11,280
effects

1613
01:02:07,679 --> 01:02:13,199
considered to act at some distance

1614
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:17,039
it is novel

1615
01:02:13,199 --> 01:02:20,000
uh with both hook and newton

1616
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:21,920
at the time the notion that two things

1617
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,679
might interact at a distance with one

1618
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,358
another without direct contact that goes

1619
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:27,038
back to antiquity

1620
01:02:25,358 --> 01:02:29,279
uh only there it would thought of more

1621
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:32,319
as a sympathetic reaction

1622
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:35,599
you know to a magnet and and a piece of

1623
01:02:32,318 --> 01:02:37,440
iron they have a kind of mutual sympathy

1624
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:39,519
for one another

1625
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,798
and like uh like what love what are we

1626
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:42,559
talking about well actually they do

1627
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:45,199
sometimes talk like that

1628
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:47,920
but that is love that i meant

1629
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:49,679
i see now i talk like that all the time

1630
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,920
i think love is somehow

1631
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:55,118
in consciousness or forces of physics

1632
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:57,920
that yet to be discovered okay

1633
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:59,599
now there's the

1634
01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:01,519
the other side of things which is

1635
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:03,519
calculus that you begin

1636
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:04,960
to talk about so newton brought a lot of

1637
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:06,719
things to this world one of them is

1638
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,960
calculus

1639
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:12,078
what is calculus

1640
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:14,000
and uh what was role what was newton's

1641
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:16,240
role in bringing it

1642
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:19,920
to life what was it like what was the

1643
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:20,879
story of bringing calculus to this world

1644
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,920
well

1645
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:25,838
since the publication starting

1646
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,680
many decades ago by

1647
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:29,759
tom whiteside who's now deceased of

1648
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,598
newton's mathematical papers

1649
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,599
we know a lot about

1650
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,760
how he was pushing things and how he was

1651
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:37,200
developing things it's a complex

1652
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,400
question to

1653
01:03:37,199 --> 01:03:42,879
to say what calculus is calculus is the

1654
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:46,720
set of mathematical techniques that

1655
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:48,960
enable you to investigate

1656
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:52,639
what we now call functions mathematical

1657
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:54,798
functions which are continuous that is

1658
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:56,000
that are not formed out of

1659
01:03:54,798 --> 01:03:59,038
discrete

1660
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,159
sets like the counting numbers for

1661
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,200
instance

1662
01:04:00,159 --> 01:04:06,318
um

1663
01:04:01,199 --> 01:04:06,318
uh newton uh there were already

1664
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,760
procedures

1665
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:12,159
for

1666
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:14,319
solving problems involving such things

1667
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:17,199
is finding areas

1668
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:20,719
to under curves and tangents to two

1669
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:24,159
curves by using geometrical structures

1670
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:25,199
but only for certain limited

1671
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:27,598
types

1672
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:30,879
of curves if you will

1673
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:32,720
um newton as a young man the

1674
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:35,760
we know this is what happened

1675
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:38,838
is looking at

1676
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:42,160
a formula which involves an

1677
01:04:38,838 --> 01:04:46,078
expansion in separate terms polynomial

1678
01:04:42,159 --> 01:04:47,759
terms as we say for certain functions

1679
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,559
i know i don't want to get complicated

1680
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:52,559
here about this but and he realizes it

1681
01:04:50,559 --> 01:04:55,280
could be generalized

1682
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:58,640
and he tries the generalization and that

1683
01:04:55,280 --> 01:05:01,280
leads him to a an expansion formula

1684
01:04:58,639 --> 01:05:02,239
called the binomial theorem

1685
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,319
that

1686
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:07,118
enables him to move ahead with the

1687
01:05:04,318 --> 01:05:09,440
notion that if i take something

1688
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:11,920
that has a certain value

1689
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,318
and i add a little bit to it and i use

1690
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:17,358
this binomial theorem and expand things

1691
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:19,838
out i can begin to do new things

1692
01:05:17,358 --> 01:05:22,480
and the new things that he begins to do

1693
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:24,960
leads him to a recognition that the

1694
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:28,240
calculations of areas and the

1695
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,760
calculations of tangents to curves

1696
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:31,279
are reciprocal

1697
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,799
to one another

1698
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,200
and the

1699
01:05:32,798 --> 01:05:39,599
procedures that he develops is a

1700
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:39,598
particular form of the calculus

1701
01:05:39,838 --> 01:05:45,920
in which uh he considers small

1702
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:49,359
increments and then continuous flows

1703
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:52,159
uh and changes of curves uh and so on

1704
01:05:49,358 --> 01:05:54,719
and we have relics of it in physics

1705
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:58,318
today the notation in which you put a

1706
01:05:54,719 --> 01:06:00,318
dot over a uh variable indicating the

1707
01:05:58,318 --> 01:06:03,199
rate of change of the variable that's

1708
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:05,038
newton's original type of notation the

1709
01:06:03,199 --> 01:06:09,038
dot yeah

1710
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:09,039
the the the dot notation

1711
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,599
possibly independently of newton

1712
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:18,159
because he didn't publish this thing

1713
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,720
although uh he became quite well known

1714
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:23,199
as quite a brilliant young man in part

1715
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:26,879
because um

1716
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:29,439
people heard about his work and so on

1717
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:31,920
uh when another young

1718
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:34,400
man by the name of gottfried leibniz

1719
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:36,960
visited london

1720
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:39,920
and he heard about these things

1721
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:41,280
it is said that he independently

1722
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,119
develops

1723
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:45,519
his form of the calculus which is

1724
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,838
actually the form we use today both in

1725
01:06:45,519 --> 01:06:49,920
notation and perhaps in certain

1726
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:51,440
fundamental ways of thinking

1727
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,159
it has remained

1728
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:55,920
a controversial point as to

1729
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:58,000
where exactly

1730
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:00,960
and how much independently leibniz did

1731
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:02,719
it leibniz aficionados think

1732
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,960
and continue to maintain he did it

1733
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:07,358
completely independently newton when he

1734
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,240
became president of the royal society

1735
01:07:07,358 --> 01:07:12,798
put together a group to go on the attack

1736
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:14,719
saying no he must have taken everything

1737
01:07:12,798 --> 01:07:16,719
we don't know

1738
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:20,318
but i will tell you this

1739
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:22,399
about uh 25 or so years ago

1740
01:07:20,318 --> 01:07:23,679
a scholar uh who's a professor at

1741
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:26,160
indiana now

1742
01:07:23,679 --> 01:07:29,838
uh named domenico melli

1743
01:07:26,159 --> 01:07:31,920
got his hands on a leibnitz manuscript

1744
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:33,759
called the ten tammon which was

1745
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:36,079
leibniz's attempt

1746
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,839
to produce an alternative to newton's

1747
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:39,760
mechanics

1748
01:07:37,838 --> 01:07:42,318
and it comes to some conclusions that

1749
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:44,240
you have in the newton's mechanics well

1750
01:07:42,318 --> 01:07:47,038
he published that but mellie got the

1751
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:49,679
manuscript and what mellie found out was

1752
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:53,039
that leibniz reverse engineered the

1753
01:07:49,679 --> 01:07:54,639
principia and cooked it backwards

1754
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:55,680
so that he could get the results he

1755
01:07:54,639 --> 01:07:57,279
wanted

1756
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,679
that was for the mechanics so that means

1757
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:01,039
his mind allows for that kind of thing

1758
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:02,798
some people

1759
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:04,319
you're breaking some news today you're

1760
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:06,480
starting some people

1761
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:08,558
some people think so i think most

1762
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:09,838
historians of mathematics do not agree

1763
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,280
with that

1764
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:12,798
a

1765
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:14,640
friend of mine rather well-known

1766
01:08:12,798 --> 01:08:17,278
physicist unfortunately died a couple

1767
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:18,719
years ago named mike nauenberg at uc

1768
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,279
santa cruz

1769
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:23,039
had some evidence along those lines

1770
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,799
didn't pass mustard

1771
01:08:23,039 --> 01:08:27,759
with many of my friends who are

1772
01:08:24,798 --> 01:08:30,000
historians of math in fact i edit with a

1773
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,119
historian of math a technical journal

1774
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,880
and

1775
01:08:31,119 --> 01:08:34,960
we were unable to publish it in there

1776
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,039
because we couldn't get it through

1777
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:41,679
any of our colleagues

1778
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,679
but i am i remain suspicious

1779
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,238
what is it about those tense

1780
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:48,000
relationships and that kind of drama

1781
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,358
einstein doesn't appear to have much of

1782
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:51,838
that drama

1783
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:53,359
nobody claims i haven't heard claims

1784
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:54,719
that they

1785
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:59,199
perhaps because it's

1786
01:08:54,719 --> 01:09:01,359
such crazy ideas of any of his major uh

1787
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:03,439
inventions major ideas

1788
01:09:01,359 --> 01:09:05,359
being those that are

1789
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:08,000
basically i came up with it first or

1790
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,679
independently there's not

1791
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,719
as far as i'm aware not many people talk

1792
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:14,719
about general relativity especially

1793
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:15,920
in those terms but with newton that was

1794
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:18,239
the case

1795
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,239
i mean

1796
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:21,759
is that just a natural outgrowth of how

1797
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:23,920
science works is there's going to be

1798
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:26,238
personalities that i'm not saying this

1799
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:30,798
about lands but maybe i am that there's

1800
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:32,399
people who uh steal ideas for the

1801
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:34,158
you know

1802
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,158
because of ego because of all those

1803
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:37,838
kinds of things i don't think it's all

1804
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:41,358
that common frankly

1805
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:43,039
um the the newton hook leibniz contra

1806
01:09:41,359 --> 01:09:44,560
tomps and so on

1807
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:47,519
well you know you're at the beginnings

1808
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:50,319
of a lot of things there and so on these

1809
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:52,480
are difficult and complex times as well

1810
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:55,760
these are times in which

1811
01:09:52,479 --> 01:10:00,158
science as an activity

1812
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:03,119
pursued by other than let us say

1813
01:10:00,158 --> 01:10:05,679
interested aristocrats is becoming

1814
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:08,640
something somewhat different it's not a

1815
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:10,319
professional community of investigators

1816
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:14,000
in the same way

1817
01:10:10,319 --> 01:10:14,000
it's also a period in which

1818
01:10:15,359 --> 01:10:20,799
procedures and rules

1819
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:23,519
of practice are being developed to avoid

1820
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:25,119
um attacking one another directly and

1821
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:27,440
pulling out a sword to cut off the other

1822
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:28,960
guy's head if he disagrees with you

1823
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:31,759
and so on

1824
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:34,480
so it's a very different period

1825
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,560
controversies happen people get angry i

1826
01:10:34,479 --> 01:10:38,639
can think of a number of others

1827
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:41,440
including in the development of optics

1828
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:44,800
in the 19th century and so on

1829
01:10:41,439 --> 01:10:46,079
and it can get hot under the collar

1830
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:49,039
sometimes

1831
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:50,960
one character who's worked an area

1832
01:10:49,039 --> 01:10:53,119
extensively whether they've come up with

1833
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:55,760
something terribly novel or not and

1834
01:10:53,119 --> 01:10:56,880
somebody else kind of moves in

1835
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,199
and

1836
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:01,520
does completely different novel things

1837
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:04,158
the first guy gets upset about it

1838
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:06,640
because he's sort of muscled into what i

1839
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:08,319
thought was my area yeah and you find

1840
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:10,800
that sort of stuff but uh do you have

1841
01:11:08,319 --> 01:11:13,519
examples of cases where it worked out

1842
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:15,360
well like uh that competition is good

1843
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:18,239
for the progress of science yeah it

1844
01:11:15,359 --> 01:11:19,839
almost always is good in that sense so

1845
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:21,919
it's just painful for the individuals

1846
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:23,600
and b yeah it doesn't have to be you

1847
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,000
know nasty

1848
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:27,679
although sometimes it is so on the space

1849
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,079
like for the example of the optics could

1850
01:11:27,679 --> 01:11:31,679
you comment on that one well yeah sure

1851
01:11:30,079 --> 01:11:34,880
let me there are several but

1852
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,880
i could give you um

1853
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:39,279
all right so i'll give you this example

1854
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:42,719
that probably is

1855
01:11:39,279 --> 01:11:42,719
the most pertinent um

1856
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:49,039
the first

1857
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:50,880
polytechnic school like mit or caltech

1858
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:53,039
was actually founded in france during

1859
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,520
the french revolution it exists today

1860
01:11:53,039 --> 01:11:56,800
it's the egg called pulley technique

1861
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,440
right

1862
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:04,239
and two people who were there

1863
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:07,839
uh were two young men in the 90s 1790s

1864
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:09,839
uh named on the one hand francois arago

1865
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,079
and the other jean-baptiste bio they

1866
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:16,000
both lived a long time well into the

1867
01:12:12,079 --> 01:12:17,198
1850s arago became a major administrator

1868
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,039
of science

1869
01:12:17,198 --> 01:12:21,279
and b.o

1870
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:23,519
his career started to peter out after

1871
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:24,800
about the late teens

1872
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:26,000
now

1873
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:28,800
they are

1874
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:30,319
sent on an expedition

1875
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:32,800
which was one of the expeditions

1876
01:12:30,319 --> 01:12:34,238
involving measuring things to start the

1877
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:36,320
metric system

1878
01:12:34,238 --> 01:12:40,000
there's a lot more to that story anyway

1879
01:12:36,319 --> 01:12:41,599
they come back arago gets separated

1880
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,479
he's captured

1881
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,840
uh

1882
01:12:42,479 --> 01:12:47,599
by uh pirates actually

1883
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:51,360
wounds up in

1884
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:53,920
uh tangier escapes is captured again

1885
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:56,319
everybody thinks he's dead he gets back

1886
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:59,359
to paris and so on he's greeted as a

1887
01:12:56,319 --> 01:13:00,880
hero and what not in the meantime b.o

1888
01:12:59,359 --> 01:13:02,399
has pretty much published some of the

1889
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:04,960
stuff that he's done and arago doesn't

1890
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:08,719
get much credit for it and aragog starts

1891
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:13,600
to get very angry and bo is known for

1892
01:13:08,719 --> 01:13:13,600
this kind of thing so hour ago anyway

1893
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:17,920
b.o

1894
01:13:15,679 --> 01:13:19,679
starts investigating a new phenomenon in

1895
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,279
optics involving something called

1896
01:13:19,679 --> 01:13:23,520
polarization

1897
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:25,920
and he writes all kinds of stuff on it

1898
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,440
arago

1899
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:29,840
looks into this

1900
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:31,279
and decides to write some things as well

1901
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,520
and actually

1902
01:13:31,279 --> 01:13:36,479
b.o gets mostly interested in it when he

1903
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:38,880
finds out that arago is doing stuff yeah

1904
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:42,319
now bo is actually the better scientist

1905
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:43,440
in a lot of ways but arago is furious

1906
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,799
about this

1907
01:13:43,439 --> 01:13:49,359
so furious that he actually demands and

1908
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:53,279
forces the leader of french science

1909
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:53,279
laplace the marquis de la place

1910
01:13:53,359 --> 01:13:58,319
and

1911
01:13:54,158 --> 01:14:01,198
cohorts to write a note in the published

1912
01:13:58,319 --> 01:14:02,559
journal saying oh excuse us

1913
01:14:01,198 --> 01:14:05,198
um

1914
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:06,880
actually arago et cetera et cetera

1915
01:14:05,198 --> 01:14:10,559
blah blah so

1916
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:12,319
arago continues to just hold this

1917
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,960
antipathy and

1918
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:17,039
fear of beo so what happens

1919
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,920
1815

1920
01:14:17,039 --> 01:14:20,560
uh

1921
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:23,039
napoleon is finished at waterloo

1922
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,960
right a young frenchman by the name of

1923
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:26,560
august stanford now

1924
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:29,439
was in the army

1925
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:31,440
is going back to his home on the north

1926
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:32,879
coast of france in normandy passes

1927
01:14:31,439 --> 01:14:35,119
through paris

1928
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:37,199
arago is friends with

1929
01:14:35,119 --> 01:14:38,079
fresnel's uncle

1930
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:40,079
uh

1931
01:14:38,079 --> 01:14:41,359
who's the head of the ecole de bozar at

1932
01:14:40,079 --> 01:14:42,399
the time

1933
01:14:41,359 --> 01:14:44,719
anyway

1934
01:14:42,399 --> 01:14:46,879
fresnel is already interested in certain

1935
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:48,960
things in light and he talks to arago

1936
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:52,159
arago tells him a few things fresnel

1937
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:54,239
goes home and fernell is a brilliant

1938
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:56,559
experimenter

1939
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:59,279
he observes things

1940
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,440
and he's a very good mathematician

1941
01:14:59,279 --> 01:15:04,079
calculates things he writes something up

1942
01:15:01,439 --> 01:15:06,158
he sends it to arago arago looks at it

1943
01:15:04,079 --> 01:15:09,600
and arago says to himself

1944
01:15:06,158 --> 01:15:12,399
i can use this to get back at b.o.

1945
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:13,199
he brings fresnel to paris sets him up

1946
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:15,920
in

1947
01:15:13,198 --> 01:15:18,319
a room at the observatory where arago is

1948
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:22,239
for fresnel to continue his work

1949
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:22,238
paper after paper comes out

1950
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:29,520
undercutting everything b.o had done

1951
01:15:26,479 --> 01:15:32,559
what is it about jealousy and

1952
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:36,400
just envy that could be an engine of

1953
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:38,400
creativity and and productivity

1954
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:40,960
versus like an einstein where it seems

1955
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:42,479
like not

1956
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,158
i don't know which one is better i guess

1957
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:46,079
it depends on the personality both are

1958
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:49,519
useful engines and science

1959
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:51,279
well in this particular story it's um

1960
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:53,679
maybe even more interesting because

1961
01:15:51,279 --> 01:15:56,399
fresnel himself the young guy

1962
01:15:53,679 --> 01:15:58,560
he knew what arigo was doing with him

1963
01:15:56,399 --> 01:16:00,158
and he didn't like it yeah he didn't

1964
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,239
want to get with he wrote his brother

1965
01:16:00,158 --> 01:16:04,238
said i you know i don't want to get an

1966
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:05,279
argument with b i just want to do my

1967
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:07,439
stuff

1968
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:09,599
arago is using him

1969
01:16:07,439 --> 01:16:12,719
but it's because arago kept pushing him

1970
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:16,000
to go into certain areas that stuff kept

1971
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,000
coming out yeah

1972
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:21,039
ego is beautiful okay but back to uh

1973
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,479
newton

1974
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,600
there's a bunch of things i want to ask

1975
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:24,718
but sort of

1976
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,039
let's say

1977
01:16:24,719 --> 01:16:28,880
since we're on the leibniz and the topic

1978
01:16:27,039 --> 01:16:29,840
of drama let me ask another drama

1979
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:34,520
question

1980
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:34,520
why was newton a complicated man

1981
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,480
we're breaking news today this is like

1982
01:16:37,439 --> 01:16:39,279
uh

1983
01:16:38,479 --> 01:16:41,599
right

1984
01:16:39,279 --> 01:16:42,960
complicated it's like

1985
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:45,520
his brain structure was different i

1986
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:48,719
don't know why he had a complicated

1987
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:49,600
young life as we've said

1988
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:51,520
he

1989
01:16:49,600 --> 01:16:53,120
had always been

1990
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,440
very

1991
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:57,359
self-contained and solitary he had

1992
01:16:55,439 --> 01:16:59,519
acquaintances in france

1993
01:16:57,359 --> 01:17:01,359
and when he moved to london eventually

1994
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:03,760
he had quite a career

1995
01:17:01,359 --> 01:17:07,039
a career for instance that led him when

1996
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:10,239
he was famous by then the 1690s he moves

1997
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:12,399
to london he becomes first

1998
01:17:10,238 --> 01:17:14,718
warden of the mint the mint is what

1999
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:16,158
produces coins and coinage was a

2000
01:17:14,719 --> 01:17:18,079
complicated thing because there was

2001
01:17:16,158 --> 01:17:20,479
counterfeiting going on

2002
01:17:18,079 --> 01:17:21,920
and he becomes master of the mint to the

2003
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:23,599
extent

2004
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,600
and a guy at mit

2005
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,679
wrote a book about this a little bit we

2006
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:29,840
wrote something on it too i forget his

2007
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:31,600
name was levin

2008
01:17:29,840 --> 01:17:34,319
newton sent

2009
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:36,159
investigators out to catch these guys

2010
01:17:34,319 --> 01:17:40,238
and sent at least one of them a famous

2011
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:40,238
one named challenger to the gallows

2012
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:44,238
so he was

2013
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:46,400
he and and one of the reasons he

2014
01:17:44,238 --> 01:17:49,039
probably was so particularly angry at

2015
01:17:46,399 --> 01:17:51,679
challenger was challenger had apparently

2016
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:54,079
said some nasty things about newton in

2017
01:17:51,679 --> 01:17:56,399
front of parliament at some point

2018
01:17:54,079 --> 01:17:58,479
fair enough yeah that was apparently not

2019
01:17:56,399 --> 01:18:00,879
a good idea well he had a bit of a ten

2020
01:17:58,479 --> 01:18:02,238
percent had a bit of a clearly okay

2021
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:04,400
clearly um

2022
01:18:02,238 --> 01:18:07,839
but he um

2023
01:18:04,399 --> 01:18:09,759
he even as a young man at uh cambridge

2024
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:13,600
though he doesn't come from wealth he

2025
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:16,079
attracts um people who recognize his

2026
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,560
smarts uh he there's a young fellow

2027
01:18:16,079 --> 01:18:20,479
named humphrey newton uh shared his

2028
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,120
rooms you know these students always

2029
01:18:20,479 --> 01:18:27,119
shared rooms with one another uh became

2030
01:18:23,119 --> 01:18:29,039
his kind of amanuensis to uh write down

2031
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,559
what newton was doing

2032
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:33,279
and so on

2033
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:36,320
and uh there were others over time

2034
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:39,119
uh who he befriended in various ways and

2035
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:42,079
so on he was solitary

2036
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:44,800
uh he had as far as we know no

2037
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:47,039
relationships with either women or men

2038
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,480
in uh anything other than a

2039
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:50,319
formal way

2040
01:18:48,479 --> 01:18:53,519
uh the only those get in the way

2041
01:18:50,319 --> 01:18:55,119
relationships right well i mean he was

2042
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,480
he he was

2043
01:18:55,119 --> 01:18:58,719
i don't know if he was close to his

2044
01:18:56,479 --> 01:19:01,119
mother i mean she passed away everything

2045
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:04,880
left him he went to be with her after

2046
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:07,198
she died he was close to his niece

2047
01:19:04,880 --> 01:19:10,400
catherine barton who basically came to

2048
01:19:07,198 --> 01:19:10,399
run his household

2049
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,560
when he moved to london and so on and

2050
01:19:13,198 --> 01:19:17,519
she married

2051
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:18,880
a man named conduit who became one of

2052
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,920
the

2053
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:25,600
people who controlled newton's legacy

2054
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:27,440
later on and so on so he and and and you

2055
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:29,520
can even see the house that the

2056
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:31,439
townhouse that newton lived in in those

2057
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:33,920
days still there

2058
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:36,158
so there's the the story of uh newton

2059
01:19:33,920 --> 01:19:38,719
coming up with quite a few ideas uh

2060
01:19:36,158 --> 01:19:41,599
during a pandemic

2061
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:44,239
we're on the outskirts of a pandemic

2062
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:46,880
ourselves right and a lot of people use

2063
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,718
that example as motivation for everybody

2064
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:49,600
while they're in lockdown to get stuff

2065
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,719
done

2066
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:52,239
uh so

2067
01:19:50,719 --> 01:19:53,119
what's that about can you tell the story

2068
01:19:52,238 --> 01:19:55,359
of that

2069
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:57,679
well i can let me first say that uh of

2070
01:19:55,359 --> 01:20:00,079
course we've been teaching over zoom

2071
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:02,158
lately and there's no zoom back then

2072
01:20:00,079 --> 01:20:03,279
yeah there was no zoom back then

2073
01:20:02,158 --> 01:20:04,799
although it wouldn't have made much

2074
01:20:03,279 --> 01:20:06,880
difference because the story was newton

2075
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:08,480
was so complicated in his lectures that

2076
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:10,639
at one point the humphrey newton

2077
01:20:08,479 --> 01:20:11,919
actually said that he might as well have

2078
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:14,639
just been lecturing to the walls because

2079
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:17,039
nobody was there yeah to listen to it so

2080
01:20:14,639 --> 01:20:20,239
what difference but uh also not a great

2081
01:20:17,039 --> 01:20:21,198
teacher huh i if you look at his optical

2082
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:23,599
notes

2083
01:20:21,198 --> 01:20:25,439
if that's what he's reading from oh boy

2084
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,679
okay

2085
01:20:25,439 --> 01:20:27,678
no

2086
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:33,199
so what uh what can you say about that

2087
01:20:30,238 --> 01:20:35,119
whole journey through the pandemic

2088
01:20:33,198 --> 01:20:38,319
that uh that resulted in so much

2089
01:20:35,119 --> 01:20:40,719
innovation right of amount of time well

2090
01:20:38,319 --> 01:20:42,399
i mean there's two times that he goes

2091
01:20:40,719 --> 01:20:44,560
home

2092
01:20:42,399 --> 01:20:46,399
would he have been able to do it and do

2093
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:47,920
do it if you'd stayed at cambridge i

2094
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:50,238
think you would have

2095
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,158
i don't think it really uh although i do

2096
01:20:50,238 --> 01:20:54,158
like to tell my advanced students when i

2097
01:20:52,158 --> 01:20:56,399
lecture on the history of physics to the

2098
01:20:54,158 --> 01:20:58,158
physics and chemistry students

2099
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:00,319
especially we've been doing it over zoom

2100
01:20:58,158 --> 01:21:03,439
last year when we get to newton and so

2101
01:21:00,319 --> 01:21:05,519
on because these kids are you know 21 22

2102
01:21:03,439 --> 01:21:06,960
i like to say well you know when newton

2103
01:21:05,520 --> 01:21:08,800
was your age

2104
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,639
and he had to go home

2105
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,320
during an epidemic do you know what he

2106
01:21:10,639 --> 01:21:14,000
produced

2107
01:21:12,319 --> 01:21:15,840
so can you actually summarize this for

2108
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:18,238
people who don't know how old was newton

2109
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:20,560
and what did he produce

2110
01:21:18,238 --> 01:21:24,638
well newton goes up to cambridge as it

2111
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:28,560
said when he's 18 years old in 1660

2112
01:21:24,639 --> 01:21:31,119
and the so-called miraculous year

2113
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:33,920
the anus mirabilis where you get the

2114
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:38,639
development in the calculus and in

2115
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:42,560
optical discoveries especially is 1666

2116
01:21:38,639 --> 01:21:45,359
right so he's what 24 years old at the

2117
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:47,600
time but judging from his

2118
01:21:45,359 --> 01:21:51,039
the notebooks that i mentioned he's

2119
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:54,400
already before that come to an awful lot

2120
01:21:51,039 --> 01:21:56,800
of uh developments uh over the previous

2121
01:21:54,399 --> 01:21:58,559
couple of years

2122
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,719
does it have much to do with the fact

2123
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,080
that he twice went home

2124
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:04,319
it is true

2125
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:06,238
that the optical experiments that we

2126
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:08,399
talked of a while ago with the light on

2127
01:22:06,238 --> 01:22:11,119
the wall moving up and down were done at

2128
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:13,759
home in fact you can visit the very room

2129
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:15,840
he did it in to this day

2130
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:18,159
yeah it's very cool and if you look

2131
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:19,840
through the window in that room there is

2132
01:22:18,158 --> 01:22:21,920
an apple tree

2133
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:23,199
out there in the garden so you might be

2134
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,800
wrong about this

2135
01:22:23,198 --> 01:22:26,319
i thought you were lying to me what

2136
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:28,719
maybe there's an apple involved after

2137
01:22:26,319 --> 01:22:31,439
all well it's it's not the same apple

2138
01:22:28,719 --> 01:22:33,679
tree but it's cuttings how do you know

2139
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:37,638
they don't last that long but okay it's

2140
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:37,639
400 years ago oh

2141
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,039
wow i continue with the dumbest

2142
01:22:39,439 --> 01:22:43,039
questions okay so

2143
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:44,399
you're saying that perhaps going home

2144
01:22:43,039 --> 01:22:47,359
was not

2145
01:22:44,399 --> 01:22:49,920
it may have given him an opportunity to

2146
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:52,000
work things through and after all he did

2147
01:22:49,920 --> 01:22:54,079
make use of that room and he could do

2148
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,158
things like put you know a shade over

2149
01:22:54,079 --> 01:22:57,119
the window move things around cut holes

2150
01:22:56,158 --> 01:22:59,759
in it and

2151
01:22:57,119 --> 01:23:02,719
do stuff probably in his rooms at

2152
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:05,039
cambridge he maybe not although

2153
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:07,520
when he stayed at cambridge

2154
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:09,600
subsequently became a fellow and then

2155
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:12,560
the first uh actually the second

2156
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:14,960
lucasian professor there he was actually

2157
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:18,080
really the first one because

2158
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:19,840
isaac barrow who was the mathematician

2159
01:23:18,079 --> 01:23:21,279
professor of optics who recognized

2160
01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:22,880
newton's genius

2161
01:23:21,279 --> 01:23:24,399
gave up what would have been his

2162
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:27,039
position

2163
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:28,960
because he recognized um

2164
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:31,039
not newton may not have learned too much

2165
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,359
from him although they did interact

2166
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:35,519
and and so newton was the first lucasian

2167
01:23:33,359 --> 01:23:36,960
professor really the one that stephen

2168
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:38,800
hawking held

2169
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:40,000
until he died

2170
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,480
and we know

2171
01:23:40,000 --> 01:23:44,960
that the rooms that he had there at

2172
01:23:42,479 --> 01:23:46,238
cambridge uh subsequently because rooms

2173
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,399
are still there

2174
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:50,799
he built an all chemical furnace outside

2175
01:23:48,399 --> 01:23:52,399
did all sorts of stuff in those rooms

2176
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:54,400
uh and

2177
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:55,279
don't forget you didn't have to do too

2178
01:23:54,399 --> 01:23:58,158
much

2179
01:23:55,279 --> 01:24:00,079
as a lucasian professor every so often

2180
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:02,079
you had to go give these lectures

2181
01:24:00,079 --> 01:24:04,399
whether anybody was there or not and

2182
01:24:02,079 --> 01:24:07,039
deposit the notes

2183
01:24:04,399 --> 01:24:09,920
uh you know for the future which is how

2184
01:24:07,039 --> 01:24:12,479
we have all those things

2185
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:14,399
oh they were stored in and now we have

2186
01:24:12,479 --> 01:24:16,638
them and now we know just how terrible

2187
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:18,559
the teacher newton was yeah but we know

2188
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:21,840
how brilliant these notes are in fact

2189
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:23,920
the second volume of newton's

2190
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,920
of the notes really on the great book

2191
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:29,600
that he published the optics which he

2192
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:32,239
published in 1704 that has just been

2193
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:35,520
uh finished with full annotations and

2194
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:38,559
analysis by the greatest analyst of

2195
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:40,080
newton's optics alan shapiro who uh

2196
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,080
retired a few years ago at the

2197
01:24:40,079 --> 01:24:43,679
university of minnesota and been working

2198
01:24:42,079 --> 01:24:46,319
on newton's optics

2199
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:49,679
ever since i knew him and before and

2200
01:24:46,319 --> 01:24:51,279
i've known him since 1976.

2201
01:24:49,679 --> 01:24:54,158
is there

2202
01:24:51,279 --> 01:24:56,158
something you could say broadly about

2203
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:59,198
what either that work on optics or

2204
01:24:56,158 --> 01:25:00,638
principia itself as a

2205
01:24:59,198 --> 01:25:01,678
something that i've never actually

2206
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,639
looked at

2207
01:25:01,679 --> 01:25:06,079
as a piece of work

2208
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:09,279
is it

2209
01:25:06,079 --> 01:25:10,960
powerful in itself or is it just an

2210
01:25:09,279 --> 01:25:12,719
important

2211
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:14,719
moment in history in terms of the amount

2212
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:15,439
of inventions that are within

2213
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:18,319
the

2214
01:25:15,439 --> 01:25:20,879
amount of ideas that are within or is it

2215
01:25:18,319 --> 01:25:23,840
a really powerful work in itself well it

2216
01:25:20,880 --> 01:25:26,560
is a powerful work in itself you can see

2217
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:29,600
this uh this guy

2218
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:32,560
coming to grips with and pushing through

2219
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:36,880
and working his way around complicated

2220
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,880
and difficult issues melding

2221
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:41,759
experimental situations which nobody had

2222
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:43,679
worked with before even discovering new

2223
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,440
things trying to figure out ways of

2224
01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:48,000
putting this together with mathematical

2225
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:49,198
structures succeeding and failing at the

2226
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:52,479
same time

2227
01:25:49,198 --> 01:25:55,678
and we can see him doing that

2228
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:58,158
i mean what is uh what is uh contained

2229
01:25:55,679 --> 01:25:59,840
within principia i don't even know in

2230
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,759
terms of the scope

2231
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:03,760
of the work all right is it the entirety

2232
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:05,760
of the body of work of uh

2233
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:08,480
of newton no no no no the principia

2234
01:26:05,760 --> 01:26:12,320
mathematic as is the calculus

2235
01:26:08,479 --> 01:26:14,158
well he all right so

2236
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:16,639
the principia is divided into three

2237
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:18,960
books excellent

2238
01:26:16,639 --> 01:26:20,719
book one contains his version of the

2239
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:23,679
laws of motion

2240
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:26,960
and the application of those laws to

2241
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:29,679
figure out when a body moves in certain

2242
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:32,239
curves and is forced to move in those

2243
01:26:29,679 --> 01:26:33,679
curves by forces directed to certain

2244
01:26:32,238 --> 01:26:36,799
fixed points

2245
01:26:33,679 --> 01:26:39,760
what is the nature of the mathematical

2246
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:43,119
formula for those forces that's all that

2247
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:46,400
book one is about and it contains not

2248
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:48,800
the kind of version of the calculus that

2249
01:26:46,399 --> 01:26:51,279
uses algebra of the sort that i was

2250
01:26:48,800 --> 01:26:54,719
trying to explain before

2251
01:26:51,279 --> 01:26:56,800
but is done in terms of

2252
01:26:54,719 --> 01:26:59,679
ratios between

2253
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:02,639
geometric line segments when one of the

2254
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:04,239
line segments goes very very small

2255
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:07,520
it's called the kind of limiting

2256
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:10,638
procedure which is calculus but it's a

2257
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:12,960
geometrically structured although it's

2258
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:14,000
clearly got algebraic elements in it as

2259
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,158
well

2260
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:19,520
and that makes the principia's

2261
01:27:16,158 --> 01:27:22,879
mathematical structure rather hard for

2262
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:24,400
people who aren't studying it today to

2263
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:28,960
go back to

2264
01:27:24,399 --> 01:27:28,960
book two contains his

2265
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:34,079
work on what we now call hydrostatics

2266
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:36,399
and a little bit about hydrodynamic

2267
01:27:34,079 --> 01:27:39,760
hydrodynamics a fuller development of

2268
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:39,759
the concept of pressure

2269
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:44,560
which is a complicated concept and book

2270
01:27:43,600 --> 01:27:47,440
three

2271
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:49,520
applies what he did in book one to the

2272
01:27:47,439 --> 01:27:51,678
solar system

2273
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:54,080
and it is successful

2274
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:55,600
partially

2275
01:27:54,079 --> 01:27:58,479
because

2276
01:27:55,600 --> 01:28:00,159
the only way that you can exactly solve

2277
01:27:58,479 --> 01:28:02,959
the only types of problems you can

2278
01:28:00,158 --> 01:28:05,359
exactly solve in terms of the

2279
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:08,000
interactions of

2280
01:28:05,359 --> 01:28:10,639
two particles governed by gravitational

2281
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,840
force between them is for only two

2282
01:28:10,639 --> 01:28:13,760
bodies

2283
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:17,039
if there's more than two

2284
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:19,280
let's say it's a b and c a x on b b x on

2285
01:28:17,039 --> 01:28:22,560
c c axon a

2286
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:25,279
you can cannot solve it exactly you have

2287
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:27,760
to develop techniques the fullest sets

2288
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:29,840
of techniques are really only developed

2289
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:32,800
about 30 or 40 years after newton's

2290
01:28:29,840 --> 01:28:35,440
death by french

2291
01:28:32,800 --> 01:28:36,639
mathematicians like laplace

2292
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:40,079
newton

2293
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:42,960
tried to apply his structure to the

2294
01:28:40,079 --> 01:28:45,119
sun earth moon because the moon's motion

2295
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:47,198
is very complicated

2296
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:50,800
the moon for instance

2297
01:28:47,198 --> 01:28:55,119
exactly repeats its observable position

2298
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:56,480
among the stars only every 19 years

2299
01:28:55,119 --> 01:28:58,079
that is if you

2300
01:28:56,479 --> 01:29:00,799
look up where the moon is among the

2301
01:28:58,079 --> 01:29:03,119
stars at certain times and it changes

2302
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:05,440
it's it's complicated that's by the way

2303
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:08,639
that was discovered

2304
01:29:05,439 --> 01:29:10,960
that was discovered by the babylonians

2305
01:29:08,639 --> 01:29:12,639
that fact in 19 years thousands of years

2306
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,480
ago yeah and then you have to look that

2307
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:15,920
little piece of data and how do you make

2308
01:29:14,479 --> 01:29:17,439
sense of it well i mean that that is

2309
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:20,480
data and you have to and it's

2310
01:29:17,439 --> 01:29:23,359
complicated so newton actually kind of

2311
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:26,238
reverse engineered a technique that had

2312
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:28,799
been developed by a man named horox

2313
01:29:26,238 --> 01:29:31,119
using certain laws of kepler's to try

2314
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:32,079
and get around this thing in newton then

2315
01:29:31,119 --> 01:29:33,920
sort of

2316
01:29:32,079 --> 01:29:35,279
my understanding i've never studied this

2317
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:37,679
has reversed

2318
01:29:35,279 --> 01:29:40,158
sort of reversed it and fit it together

2319
01:29:37,679 --> 01:29:42,158
with his force calculations by way of an

2320
01:29:40,158 --> 01:29:44,238
approximation

2321
01:29:42,158 --> 01:29:45,920
and

2322
01:29:44,238 --> 01:29:48,479
was able to construct a model to make

2323
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:49,359
some predictions

2324
01:29:48,479 --> 01:29:53,439
fit

2325
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:54,960
things backwards pretty well

2326
01:29:53,439 --> 01:29:57,599
okay

2327
01:29:54,960 --> 01:30:00,560
where does data fit into this we kind of

2328
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:02,800
earlier in the discussion

2329
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:04,719
uh mention data as part of the

2330
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,400
scientific method

2331
01:30:04,719 --> 01:30:09,840
how important was

2332
01:30:06,399 --> 01:30:12,638
data to newton okay so like you

2333
01:30:09,840 --> 01:30:14,400
mentioned uh prism and playing with it

2334
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:16,480
and looking at stuff and then coming up

2335
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:18,719
with calculations and so on where does

2336
01:30:16,479 --> 01:30:20,799
data fit into any of his ideas

2337
01:30:18,719 --> 01:30:23,359
all right well let me say two things

2338
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:26,239
first one we rarely use the phrase

2339
01:30:23,359 --> 01:30:27,759
scientific method anymore because there

2340
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:28,959
is no one

2341
01:30:27,760 --> 01:30:31,360
easily

2342
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:33,520
describable such method in a certain i

2343
01:30:31,359 --> 01:30:35,359
mean humans have been playing around

2344
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:37,679
with the world and learning how to

2345
01:30:35,359 --> 01:30:40,319
repetitively do things and make things

2346
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:41,440
happen ever since you know humans became

2347
01:30:40,319 --> 01:30:42,479
humans

2348
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:44,000
um

2349
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:45,519
do you have a preferred definition of

2350
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:47,760
the scientific method what are the

2351
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,840
various uh no i don't

2352
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:52,079
i prefer to talk about

2353
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,079
um

2354
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:55,039
the

2355
01:30:53,760 --> 01:30:58,639
considered

2356
01:30:55,039 --> 01:31:00,319
manipulation of artificial structures to

2357
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:05,119
produce results

2358
01:31:00,319 --> 01:31:08,719
that can be worked together with schemes

2359
01:31:05,119 --> 01:31:10,960
to construct other devices and make

2360
01:31:08,719 --> 01:31:10,960
uh

2361
01:31:11,039 --> 01:31:14,399
predictions if you will about the way

2362
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:16,480
such things will work

2363
01:31:14,399 --> 01:31:19,279
so ultimately it's about producing other

2364
01:31:16,479 --> 01:31:21,279
devices it's like leads you down uh i

2365
01:31:19,279 --> 01:31:24,158
think so principally

2366
01:31:21,279 --> 01:31:26,238
uh i mean you may have data if you will

2367
01:31:24,158 --> 01:31:29,198
like astronomical data

2368
01:31:26,238 --> 01:31:31,678
obtained otherwise and so on but yes

2369
01:31:29,198 --> 01:31:34,000
and but but but number two here is this

2370
01:31:31,679 --> 01:31:35,679
question of data what is data

2371
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:37,760
in that sense see when we talk about

2372
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:39,760
data today

2373
01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:42,320
um we have

2374
01:31:39,760 --> 01:31:45,600
a kind of complex notion which

2375
01:31:42,319 --> 01:31:50,158
reverts to even issues of statistics

2376
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:52,320
and measurement procedures and so on so

2377
01:31:50,158 --> 01:31:55,039
let me put it to you this way so

2378
01:31:52,319 --> 01:31:57,279
let's say i had a ruler in front of me

2379
01:31:55,039 --> 01:31:59,760
go on and it's marked off in little

2380
01:31:57,279 --> 01:32:01,840
black marks separated by let's say

2381
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:03,440
distances

2382
01:32:01,840 --> 01:32:05,600
called a millimeter

2383
01:32:03,439 --> 01:32:08,960
okay now i make a mark on this piece of

2384
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:10,000
paper here so i made a nice black mark

2385
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:11,439
right

2386
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,198
nice black mark

2387
01:32:11,439 --> 01:32:15,678
and i ask you i want you to measure that

2388
01:32:13,198 --> 01:32:17,759
and tell me how long it is

2389
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:20,319
you're going to take the ruler

2390
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:22,239
you're going to put it next to it

2391
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:24,960
and you're going to look

2392
01:32:22,238 --> 01:32:27,279
and it's not going to sit even if you

2393
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:29,520
put one end as close as you can on one

2394
01:32:27,279 --> 01:32:31,840
black mark the other end probably isn't

2395
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:34,000
going to be exactly on a black mark well

2396
01:32:31,840 --> 01:32:36,319
you'll say it's closer to this or that

2397
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:38,079
you write down a number and i say okay

2398
01:32:36,319 --> 01:32:40,559
take the ruler away a minute i take this

2399
01:32:38,079 --> 01:32:42,639
away come back in five minutes put the

2400
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,920
piece of paper down do it again

2401
01:32:42,639 --> 01:32:45,600
you're going to probably come up with a

2402
01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:46,880
different number

2403
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,920
and you're going to do that a lot of

2404
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:49,359
times

2405
01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:51,920
and then if i tell you i want you to

2406
01:32:49,359 --> 01:32:54,158
give me your best estimate of what the

2407
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,520
actual length of that thing is what are

2408
01:32:54,158 --> 01:32:56,879
you going to do

2409
01:32:55,520 --> 01:32:59,840
you're going to

2410
01:32:56,880 --> 01:33:02,079
average all of these numbers

2411
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:02,079
why

2412
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,360
statistics

2413
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,639
well yes

2414
01:33:07,359 --> 01:33:10,880
statistics

2415
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:14,079
there's lots of ways of going around it

2416
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:15,920
but the average is the best estimate on

2417
01:33:14,079 --> 01:33:17,439
the basis of what's called the central

2418
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:19,199
limit theorem

2419
01:33:17,439 --> 01:33:20,479
a statistical thing we were talking

2420
01:33:19,198 --> 01:33:22,678
about things

2421
01:33:20,479 --> 01:33:26,879
that were not really developed until the

2422
01:33:22,679 --> 01:33:29,039
1750s 60s and 70s newton died in 1727.

2423
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:31,359
the intuition perhaps was there not

2424
01:33:29,039 --> 01:33:33,439
really i'll tell you what people did

2425
01:33:31,359 --> 01:33:35,679
including newton although newton is

2426
01:33:33,439 --> 01:33:37,279
partially the one exception

2427
01:33:35,679 --> 01:33:39,039
we talked a while ago about this guy

2428
01:33:37,279 --> 01:33:41,759
christian huygens

2429
01:33:39,039 --> 01:33:42,800
he measured lots of things and he was a

2430
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,480
good

2431
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:47,039
mechanic himself

2432
01:33:44,479 --> 01:33:48,959
he and his brother ground lenses huygens

2433
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:51,679
i told you developed the first pendulum

2434
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:54,719
mechanism pendulum driven clock with a

2435
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:56,639
mechanism and so on also

2436
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,399
a spring watch where he got into a

2437
01:33:56,639 --> 01:33:59,600
controversy with hook over that by the

2438
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:02,079
way

2439
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:04,800
um well these mechanics and the

2440
01:34:02,079 --> 01:34:06,639
controversy yeah

2441
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:08,719
well we also have

2442
01:34:06,639 --> 01:34:11,760
huygens's notes

2443
01:34:08,719 --> 01:34:15,119
um they're preserved at the at leiden

2444
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:16,800
university in holland he's dutch

2445
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:18,719
for his work in optics which was

2446
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,480
extensive we don't have time to go into

2447
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:22,480
that except the following

2448
01:34:20,479 --> 01:34:24,799
a number of years ago i went through

2449
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:26,399
those things because in this optical

2450
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:29,520
theory that he had

2451
01:34:26,399 --> 01:34:32,079
there are four numbers that you've got

2452
01:34:29,520 --> 01:34:35,360
to be able to get good numbers on to be

2453
01:34:32,079 --> 01:34:37,359
able to predict other things

2454
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:39,039
so what would we do today what in fact

2455
01:34:37,359 --> 01:34:41,118
was done at the end of the 18th century

2456
01:34:39,039 --> 01:34:42,800
when somebody went back to this you do

2457
01:34:41,118 --> 01:34:44,639
what you just i told you to do with the

2458
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,960
ruler you make a lot of measurements and

2459
01:34:44,639 --> 01:34:49,118
average results

2460
01:34:46,960 --> 01:34:51,039
we have huygens notes he did make a lot

2461
01:34:49,118 --> 01:34:53,920
of measurements

2462
01:34:51,039 --> 01:34:55,359
one after the other after the other

2463
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:58,560
but when he

2464
01:34:55,359 --> 01:35:00,960
came to use the numbers for calculations

2465
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:03,119
and indeed when he published things

2466
01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:05,439
at the end of his life

2467
01:35:03,118 --> 01:35:08,000
he gives you one number and it's not the

2468
01:35:05,439 --> 01:35:08,799
average of any of them it's just one of

2469
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:13,198
them

2470
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:14,560
which one was it the one that he thought

2471
01:35:13,198 --> 01:35:16,960
he got

2472
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:19,840
so good at

2473
01:35:16,960 --> 01:35:21,920
working by practice that he put down the

2474
01:35:19,840 --> 01:35:24,880
one he was most confident in

2475
01:35:21,920 --> 01:35:27,760
that was the general procedure

2476
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:30,319
at the time you wouldn't publish a paper

2477
01:35:27,760 --> 01:35:32,480
in which you wrote down six numbers and

2478
01:35:30,319 --> 01:35:34,238
said well i measured this six times let

2479
01:35:32,479 --> 01:35:35,279
me put them together none of them is

2480
01:35:34,238 --> 01:35:38,158
really

2481
01:35:35,279 --> 01:35:40,880
they would have said the right number

2482
01:35:38,158 --> 01:35:42,719
but i'll put them together and give you

2483
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:43,920
a good number no you would have been

2484
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:46,399
thought of that you know you don't know

2485
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:49,840
what you're doing yeah

2486
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:52,879
by the way there's just an inkling of

2487
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:54,400
value to that approach

2488
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:56,560
just an inkling

2489
01:35:54,399 --> 01:35:58,638
we sometimes use statistics as like a

2490
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:59,760
thing that like oh that solves all the

2491
01:35:58,639 --> 01:36:01,440
problems

2492
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:03,840
we'll just do a lot of it and we'll take

2493
01:36:01,439 --> 01:36:05,359
the average or whatever it is as many

2494
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,600
excellent books and mathematics have

2495
01:36:05,359 --> 01:36:11,679
highlighted the flaws

2496
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:14,320
in our uh approach to certain sciences

2497
01:36:11,679 --> 01:36:16,319
that rely heavily on statistics okay let

2498
01:36:14,319 --> 01:36:19,519
me ask you again for a friend

2499
01:36:16,319 --> 01:36:21,840
about uh this alchemy thing

2500
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:25,280
you know it'd be nice to create gold but

2501
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:27,600
also seems to uh come into play quite a

2502
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:29,920
bit throughout the history of science

2503
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:32,480
perhaps in positive ways in terms of its

2504
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:34,000
impact can you say something to the

2505
01:36:32,479 --> 01:36:35,599
history of alchemy

2506
01:36:34,000 --> 01:36:36,840
a little bit

2507
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:40,159
sure

2508
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:43,279
um it used to be thought

2509
01:36:40,158 --> 01:36:45,439
two things one that alchemy

2510
01:36:43,279 --> 01:36:48,158
which dates certainly back to the

2511
01:36:45,439 --> 01:36:50,000
islamic period in islam

2512
01:36:48,158 --> 01:36:52,879
you're talking you know

2513
01:36:50,000 --> 01:36:55,039
11th 12th 13th centuries

2514
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:56,719
among islamic natural philosophers and

2515
01:36:55,039 --> 01:36:58,880
experimenters

2516
01:36:56,719 --> 01:37:02,239
but it used to be thought that

2517
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:05,440
alchemy which picked up strikingly in

2518
01:37:02,238 --> 01:37:07,359
the 15th 16th century 1500s and

2519
01:37:05,439 --> 01:37:10,638
thereabouts

2520
01:37:07,359 --> 01:37:13,198
was a sort of mystical procedure

2521
01:37:10,639 --> 01:37:14,800
involving all sorts of strange notions

2522
01:37:13,198 --> 01:37:17,519
and so on and

2523
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:20,480
that's not entirely untrue

2524
01:37:17,520 --> 01:37:25,119
but it is substantially untrue in that

2525
01:37:20,479 --> 01:37:28,319
alchemists were engaged in what uh

2526
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:32,399
was known as chrysopoeia that is

2527
01:37:28,319 --> 01:37:36,719
looking for ways to transform

2528
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:39,679
invaluable materials into valuable ones

2529
01:37:36,719 --> 01:37:41,520
but in the process of doing so or

2530
01:37:39,679 --> 01:37:42,480
attempting to do so

2531
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,320
they

2532
01:37:42,479 --> 01:37:48,238
learned how to

2533
01:37:44,319 --> 01:37:52,000
uh create complex amalgams of various

2534
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:55,279
kinds they used very elaborate apparatus

2535
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:58,399
glass olympics in which they would use

2536
01:37:55,279 --> 01:37:59,439
heat to produce chemical decompositions

2537
01:37:58,399 --> 01:38:00,960
they would

2538
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:03,839
write down and observe these

2539
01:38:00,960 --> 01:38:06,079
compositions and many of the so-called

2540
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:07,760
really strange-looking alchemical

2541
01:38:06,079 --> 01:38:10,238
formulas and statements where they'll

2542
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:11,119
say something like i i can't produce it

2543
01:38:10,238 --> 01:38:13,519
but it'll be

2544
01:38:11,118 --> 01:38:15,198
the soul of mars will

2545
01:38:13,520 --> 01:38:18,080
combine with the

2546
01:38:15,198 --> 01:38:21,359
this etc etc these

2547
01:38:18,079 --> 01:38:24,238
it has been shown are almost all actual

2548
01:38:21,359 --> 01:38:26,719
formulas for how to engage in the

2549
01:38:24,238 --> 01:38:28,399
production of complex amalgams

2550
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:31,039
and what to do

2551
01:38:28,399 --> 01:38:34,319
and by the time of newton

2552
01:38:31,039 --> 01:38:36,800
newton was reading the works of a

2553
01:38:34,319 --> 01:38:39,118
uh fellow by the name of starkey who was

2554
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:40,639
actually came from harvard

2555
01:38:39,118 --> 01:38:42,880
uh

2556
01:38:40,639 --> 01:38:44,480
shortly before

2557
01:38:42,880 --> 01:38:46,880
in which um

2558
01:38:44,479 --> 01:38:49,519
things had progressed if you will to the

2559
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:52,159
point where the procedure turns into

2560
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:55,520
what historians call chrysopoeia

2561
01:38:52,158 --> 01:38:57,839
which basically runs into the notion of

2562
01:38:55,520 --> 01:39:00,400
thinking that may these things are made

2563
01:38:57,840 --> 01:39:02,880
out of particles

2564
01:39:00,399 --> 01:39:05,599
this is the mechanical philosophy can we

2565
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,679
engage in processes chemical processes

2566
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:10,079
to rearrange these things

2567
01:39:07,679 --> 01:39:11,840
which is not so stupid after all

2568
01:39:10,079 --> 01:39:15,519
i mean we do it except we happen to do

2569
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:17,360
it in reactors not in chemical processes

2570
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:19,840
unless of course it had happened that

2571
01:39:17,359 --> 01:39:21,359
cold fusion had worked which it didn't

2572
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:24,480
um i uh

2573
01:39:21,359 --> 01:39:26,158
well right but um so that's the way

2574
01:39:24,479 --> 01:39:28,559
they're thinking about these things

2575
01:39:26,158 --> 01:39:30,158
there's a kind of mix and newton engages

2576
01:39:28,560 --> 01:39:33,600
extensively

2577
01:39:30,158 --> 01:39:38,319
in those sorts of manipulations in fact

2578
01:39:33,600 --> 01:39:40,639
more in that than almost anything else

2579
01:39:38,319 --> 01:39:43,079
except for his optical investigations if

2580
01:39:40,639 --> 01:39:46,480
you look through the latter parts of the

2581
01:39:43,079 --> 01:39:49,198
1670s the last five six seven years or

2582
01:39:46,479 --> 01:39:51,359
so of that there's more on that than

2583
01:39:49,198 --> 01:39:54,238
there is on anything else he's not

2584
01:39:51,359 --> 01:39:56,399
working on mechanics he's pretty much

2585
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:58,399
gone pretty far in optics he'll turn

2586
01:39:56,399 --> 01:40:00,399
back to optics later on

2587
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:02,479
so optics and alchemy

2588
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:05,439
so what you're saying is isaac newton

2589
01:40:02,479 --> 01:40:07,439
liked shiny things

2590
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:09,279
well actually if you go online and look

2591
01:40:07,439 --> 01:40:10,719
at what bill newman the professor at

2592
01:40:09,279 --> 01:40:13,198
indiana

2593
01:40:10,719 --> 01:40:15,520
at bloomington indiana has produced

2594
01:40:13,198 --> 01:40:18,399
you'll find the very shiny thing called

2595
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:19,920
the star regulus which newton describes

2596
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:22,479
as having produced according to a

2597
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:24,639
particular way which newman figured out

2598
01:40:22,479 --> 01:40:25,919
and was able to do it and it's very

2599
01:40:24,639 --> 01:40:28,000
shiny

2600
01:40:25,920 --> 01:40:28,800
there you go proves the theorem

2601
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,520
i

2602
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:34,719
can ask you about god religion and its

2603
01:40:31,520 --> 01:40:37,840
role in newton's life

2604
01:40:34,719 --> 01:40:37,840
was there

2605
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,279
helpful

2606
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:44,880
constructive

2607
01:40:41,279 --> 01:40:47,920
or destructive influences of religion

2608
01:40:44,880 --> 01:40:49,440
in his work and and in his life

2609
01:40:47,920 --> 01:40:52,480
well there you begin to touch on a

2610
01:40:49,439 --> 01:40:55,519
complex question um

2611
01:40:52,479 --> 01:40:57,599
the role that god played would be an

2612
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:59,360
interesting question to answer should

2613
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,520
one go and be able to speak with this

2614
01:40:59,359 --> 01:41:03,439
invisible character who doesn't exist

2615
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:05,199
but putting that aside for the moment

2616
01:41:03,439 --> 01:41:07,678
yeah we don't like to talk about others

2617
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:09,919
while they're not here so right

2618
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:12,560
um newton is

2619
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:14,319
a deeply religious man not unusually so

2620
01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:17,800
of course for the assignment

2621
01:41:14,319 --> 01:41:17,799
and um

2622
01:41:19,039 --> 01:41:24,960
clearly his upbringing

2623
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:25,920
and perhaps his early experiences

2624
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:28,319
have

2625
01:41:25,920 --> 01:41:30,639
exacerbated that in a number of ways

2626
01:41:28,319 --> 01:41:33,840
that he takes a lot of things personally

2627
01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:38,079
and and he finds perhaps solace

2628
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:39,520
in thinking about a sort of governing

2629
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:41,118
abstract

2630
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,800
rule-making

2631
01:41:41,118 --> 01:41:45,279
exacting

2632
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:45,279
deity

2633
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:50,960
i think there is little question

2634
01:41:48,560 --> 01:41:52,320
that his

2635
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:55,439
conviction

2636
01:41:52,319 --> 01:41:58,479
that you can figure things out

2637
01:41:55,439 --> 01:42:02,238
has a fair bit to do

2638
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:03,279
with his profound belief that this rule

2639
01:42:02,238 --> 01:42:06,718
maker

2640
01:42:03,279 --> 01:42:09,599
doesn't do things arbitrarily

2641
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:10,639
newton does not think that miracles have

2642
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:14,079
happened

2643
01:42:10,639 --> 01:42:16,159
since maybe the time of christ if then

2644
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:18,399
and not in the same way he was for

2645
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:21,039
instance an anti-trinitarian

2646
01:42:18,399 --> 01:42:22,158
he did not hold that christ had a divine

2647
01:42:21,039 --> 01:42:24,079
being

2648
01:42:22,158 --> 01:42:28,960
but was rather endowed with certain

2649
01:42:24,079 --> 01:42:30,158
powers by the rule maker and whatnot and

2650
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:33,439
um

2651
01:42:30,158 --> 01:42:34,638
he uh did not think that some of the

2652
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:37,118
uh

2653
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:39,760
tales of the old testament with various

2654
01:42:37,118 --> 01:42:42,000
miracles and so on occurred in anything

2655
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:43,039
like that way some may have some may not

2656
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,520
have

2657
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:48,000
um like everybody else of course he did

2658
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:49,840
think that creation had happened about

2659
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:52,639
six thousand years ago

2660
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:54,639
wait really oh yeah sure

2661
01:42:52,639 --> 01:42:55,840
well biblical chronology can give you a

2662
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:57,760
little bit about that's a little

2663
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:59,119
controversial but sure

2664
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:02,079
interesting

2665
01:42:59,118 --> 01:43:04,158
wow the deity created

2666
01:43:02,079 --> 01:43:06,319
the universe

2667
01:43:04,158 --> 01:43:07,920
six thousand years ago and that didn't

2668
01:43:06,319 --> 01:43:09,679
interfere with his

2669
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:12,000
uh playing around with the sun and the

2670
01:43:09,679 --> 01:43:14,880
moon and the oh no because he's figuring

2671
01:43:12,000 --> 01:43:17,920
out he's he's watching the brilliant

2672
01:43:14,880 --> 01:43:20,480
construction that this

2673
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:21,600
perfect entity did six thousand years

2674
01:43:20,479 --> 01:43:23,919
ago

2675
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:26,079
yeah has produced plus or minus a few

2676
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:29,760
years well if you go with bishop buster

2677
01:43:26,079 --> 01:43:29,760
it's 4004 bce

2678
01:43:30,079 --> 01:43:34,479
i want to be precise about it

2679
01:43:32,079 --> 01:43:36,840
we always on this this is a serious

2680
01:43:34,479 --> 01:43:39,519
program we always want to be

2681
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:42,079
precise uh okay let me ask another

2682
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:45,440
ridiculous question if uh

2683
01:43:42,079 --> 01:43:48,399
if newton were to travel forward in time

2684
01:43:45,439 --> 01:43:52,319
and visit with einstein

2685
01:43:48,399 --> 01:43:52,319
and have a discussion about

2686
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:57,118
space time and general relativity that

2687
01:43:55,039 --> 01:43:58,719
conception of time that conception of

2688
01:43:57,118 --> 01:44:01,118
gravity what do you think that

2689
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:02,319
discussion will go

2690
01:44:01,118 --> 01:44:05,198
like

2691
01:44:02,319 --> 01:44:06,799
uh put that way i think newton would sit

2692
01:44:05,198 --> 01:44:08,479
there and shock and say i have no idea

2693
01:44:06,800 --> 01:44:10,480
what you're talking about

2694
01:44:08,479 --> 01:44:12,479
if on the other hand

2695
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:15,039
there's a time machine you go back and

2696
01:44:12,479 --> 01:44:16,238
bring a somewhat younger newton

2697
01:44:15,039 --> 01:44:19,840
not a man

2698
01:44:16,238 --> 01:44:22,238
my age say i mean he lived a long time

2699
01:44:19,840 --> 01:44:24,239
you know into his mid 80s

2700
01:44:22,238 --> 01:44:25,359
but take him when he's in his 40s let's

2701
01:44:24,238 --> 01:44:27,198
say

2702
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:30,238
bring him forward and don't immediately

2703
01:44:27,198 --> 01:44:32,638
introduce him to einstein let's take him

2704
01:44:30,238 --> 01:44:34,319
for a ride on a railroad

2705
01:44:32,639 --> 01:44:36,079
let him experience the railroad oh

2706
01:44:34,319 --> 01:44:37,279
that's right

2707
01:44:36,079 --> 01:44:39,118
take him

2708
01:44:37,279 --> 01:44:39,920
around and

2709
01:44:39,118 --> 01:44:41,118
um

2710
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,239
show him

2711
01:44:41,118 --> 01:44:44,319
uh

2712
01:44:42,238 --> 01:44:48,158
a sparking machine

2713
01:44:44,319 --> 01:44:51,359
he knows about sparks sending off sparks

2714
01:44:48,158 --> 01:44:53,198
show him wires have him touch the wires

2715
01:44:51,359 --> 01:44:56,479
and get a little shock

2716
01:44:53,198 --> 01:44:59,678
show him a clicking telegraph

2717
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:02,319
machine of the kind then let him hear

2718
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:04,000
the clicks in a telephone receiver and

2719
01:45:02,319 --> 01:45:05,599
so on do that

2720
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,560
for a couple of months

2721
01:45:05,600 --> 01:45:11,039
let him get accustomed to things

2722
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:12,480
then take him into not einstein yet

2723
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:14,158
let's say we're taking him into the

2724
01:45:12,479 --> 01:45:16,479
1890s

2725
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:18,960
einstein is young man then we take him

2726
01:45:16,479 --> 01:45:21,198
into some of the laboratories

2727
01:45:18,960 --> 01:45:24,399
we show him some of the equipment the

2728
01:45:21,198 --> 01:45:26,879
devices not the most elaborate ones we

2729
01:45:24,399 --> 01:45:29,439
show him certain things we educate him

2730
01:45:26,880 --> 01:45:31,600
bit by bit well the optics maybe focus

2731
01:45:29,439 --> 01:45:33,919
on that certainly

2732
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:36,159
you begin to show him things he's a

2733
01:45:33,920 --> 01:45:38,319
brilliant human being

2734
01:45:36,158 --> 01:45:42,479
i think bit by bit

2735
01:45:38,319 --> 01:45:44,079
he would begin to see what's going on

2736
01:45:42,479 --> 01:45:45,919
but if you just dumped him in front of

2737
01:45:44,079 --> 01:45:48,158
einstein he'd sit there his eyes would

2738
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:50,800
glaze over

2739
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:53,359
i mean this uh i guess it's it's almost

2740
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:53,360
a question

2741
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:57,920
of how big of a leap

2742
01:45:56,319 --> 01:46:00,799
how many leaps have been taken in

2743
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:02,480
science that go from newton to einstein

2744
01:46:00,800 --> 01:46:04,639
we sometimes in a compressed version of

2745
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:07,198
history think that

2746
01:46:04,639 --> 01:46:08,880
not much

2747
01:46:07,198 --> 01:46:10,238
oh that's totally wrong

2748
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:11,520
a lot

2749
01:46:10,238 --> 01:46:14,000
huge amounts

2750
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:15,679
in multifarious ways

2751
01:46:14,000 --> 01:46:18,000
involving fundamental conceptions

2752
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:20,239
mathematical structures the evolution of

2753
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:21,760
novel experimentation and devices the

2754
01:46:20,238 --> 01:46:24,638
organization

2755
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:28,480
everything everything i mean to a point

2756
01:46:24,639 --> 01:46:29,520
where i wonder even if newton was

2757
01:46:28,479 --> 01:46:32,638
uh

2758
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:35,360
like you said 40 but even like 30. so

2759
01:46:32,639 --> 01:46:36,880
he's very like if he would be able to

2760
01:46:35,359 --> 01:46:39,599
catch up with the conception of

2761
01:46:36,880 --> 01:46:41,039
everything i i wonder as a scientist

2762
01:46:39,600 --> 01:46:43,840
how much

2763
01:46:41,039 --> 01:46:45,679
you load in from age five

2764
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:48,079
about this world in order to be able to

2765
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:50,800
conceive of the world

2766
01:46:48,079 --> 01:46:52,000
of ideas that uh that push that science

2767
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,279
forward

2768
01:46:52,000 --> 01:46:55,520
i mean you mentioned the railroad and

2769
01:46:53,279 --> 01:46:57,519
all those kinds of things that that we

2770
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:59,679
might that might be fundamental to our

2771
01:46:57,520 --> 01:47:04,000
ability to invent even when it doesn't

2772
01:46:59,679 --> 01:47:04,000
directly obviously seem relevant

2773
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,840
well

2774
01:47:05,760 --> 01:47:11,280
yes

2775
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:14,480
um i mean the railroad the steam engine

2776
01:47:11,279 --> 01:47:16,399
the watt engine etc i mean that was

2777
01:47:14,479 --> 01:47:18,638
really the one engine you know was

2778
01:47:16,399 --> 01:47:21,839
developed pretty although what knew

2779
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:23,760
joseph black a chemist scientist so on

2780
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:27,199
did stuff on heat was developed pretty

2781
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:27,199
much independently of

2782
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:33,118
the developing thoughts about heat

2783
01:47:31,198 --> 01:47:34,960
at the time but what it's not

2784
01:47:33,118 --> 01:47:38,719
independent of

2785
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:42,319
is the evolution of practice in the

2786
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:45,279
manufacture and construction of devices

2787
01:47:42,319 --> 01:47:47,840
which can do things in extraordinarily

2788
01:47:45,279 --> 01:47:50,639
novel ways and the premium being

2789
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:53,279
gradually placed on calculating how you

2790
01:47:50,639 --> 01:47:55,279
can make them more efficient

2791
01:47:53,279 --> 01:47:56,079
that is of a piece

2792
01:47:55,279 --> 01:47:58,800
with

2793
01:47:56,079 --> 01:48:01,439
a way of thinking about the world in

2794
01:47:58,800 --> 01:48:03,520
which you're controlling things

2795
01:48:01,439 --> 01:48:05,439
and working it's something that you know

2796
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:06,159
humans have been doing for a long time

2797
01:48:05,439 --> 01:48:08,319
but

2798
01:48:06,158 --> 01:48:09,118
in this more concerted

2799
01:48:08,319 --> 01:48:11,359
and

2800
01:48:09,118 --> 01:48:14,238
uh structured way

2801
01:48:11,359 --> 01:48:16,158
i think you really don't find it in the

2802
01:48:14,238 --> 01:48:17,599
fullest sense until

2803
01:48:16,158 --> 01:48:20,960
uh

2804
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:25,679
well into the 1500s and really not fully

2805
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:25,679
until the 17th century later on

2806
01:48:25,920 --> 01:48:32,000
so newton had this uh year of miracles

2807
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:34,559
i wonder if i could ask you briefly

2808
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,840
about einstein in his year miracles i've

2809
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:38,800
been reading

2810
01:48:35,840 --> 01:48:40,639
i'm re-reading revisiting

2811
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,560
the brilliance of

2812
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:44,639
the papers that einstein published in

2813
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,639
the year 1905

2814
01:48:44,639 --> 01:48:48,639
one of which one of the nobel prize the

2815
01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:50,319
photoelectric effect but also brian

2816
01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:52,239
motion special

2817
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:54,158
theory of relativity

2818
01:48:52,238 --> 01:48:58,319
and of course the uh

2819
01:48:54,158 --> 01:48:58,319
the old e equals mc squared

2820
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:02,800
is there um

2821
01:49:00,479 --> 01:49:05,118
does that make sense to you that uh

2822
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:06,639
these two figures had such productive

2823
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:09,039
years

2824
01:49:06,639 --> 01:49:10,800
that there's this moment of genius maybe

2825
01:49:09,039 --> 01:49:12,000
maybe if we zoom out

2826
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:13,599
i mean i

2827
01:49:12,000 --> 01:49:15,359
my work is very much in artificial

2828
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:16,719
intelligence so

2829
01:49:15,359 --> 01:49:17,920
wondering about the nature of

2830
01:49:16,719 --> 01:49:20,000
intelligence

2831
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:23,118
like how did we

2832
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:25,118
how did evolution on earth produce

2833
01:49:23,118 --> 01:49:27,519
genius

2834
01:49:25,118 --> 01:49:29,920
that could come up with so much in so

2835
01:49:27,520 --> 01:49:31,599
little time to me that gives me hope

2836
01:49:29,920 --> 01:49:33,520
that one person

2837
01:49:31,599 --> 01:49:35,440
can change the world

2838
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:38,239
in such a small amount of time well of

2839
01:49:35,439 --> 01:49:38,238
course there are

2840
01:49:38,960 --> 01:49:43,599
precedents for

2841
01:49:40,719 --> 01:49:45,840
in both newtons and einstein's cases for

2842
01:49:43,599 --> 01:49:48,400
elements of what we're finding there

2843
01:49:45,840 --> 01:49:50,319
it's you know and so on

2844
01:49:48,399 --> 01:49:51,839
well i have no idea you know i'm sure

2845
01:49:50,319 --> 01:49:53,759
you must have read it was kind of a

2846
01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:56,719
famous story that um

2847
01:49:53,760 --> 01:49:58,320
after einstein died he donated his brain

2848
01:49:56,719 --> 01:50:00,239
and they sliced it up to see if they

2849
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:03,118
could find something unusual there and

2850
01:50:00,238 --> 01:50:04,079
nothing unusual visibly

2851
01:50:03,118 --> 01:50:07,198
in there

2852
01:50:04,079 --> 01:50:08,399
so i have i

2853
01:50:07,198 --> 01:50:11,519
clearly

2854
01:50:08,399 --> 01:50:13,839
there are people who for various reasons

2855
01:50:11,520 --> 01:50:16,560
maybe both intrinsic and

2856
01:50:13,840 --> 01:50:19,599
extrinsic in the sense of experience and

2857
01:50:16,560 --> 01:50:21,280
so on are capable of coming up with

2858
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:22,719
these extraordinary

2859
01:50:21,279 --> 01:50:26,238
uh results

2860
01:50:22,719 --> 01:50:28,000
many years ago when i was a student

2861
01:50:26,238 --> 01:50:29,598
a friend of mine came in and said did

2862
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:31,599
you read about did you read this i

2863
01:50:29,599 --> 01:50:32,960
forget what anyway there was a story in

2864
01:50:31,599 --> 01:50:35,440
the paper

2865
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:36,960
it was about i think it was a young

2866
01:50:35,439 --> 01:50:38,879
woman

2867
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,840
who um

2868
01:50:38,880 --> 01:50:41,760
was

2869
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:44,400
she couldn't speak

2870
01:50:41,760 --> 01:50:46,320
and she she was somewhere on the autism

2871
01:50:44,399 --> 01:50:48,319
spectrum she could not

2872
01:50:46,319 --> 01:50:50,960
um read

2873
01:50:48,319 --> 01:50:52,799
other people's affect

2874
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:56,800
in any ways

2875
01:50:52,800 --> 01:50:58,079
but she could sit down at a piano

2876
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,800
and

2877
01:50:58,079 --> 01:51:04,158
having heard it once and then run

2878
01:51:00,800 --> 01:51:05,199
variations on the most complex

2879
01:51:04,158 --> 01:51:06,399
uh

2880
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:09,519
pianistic

2881
01:51:06,399 --> 01:51:12,319
works of chopin and others

2882
01:51:09,520 --> 01:51:12,320
right now how

2883
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:20,158
some aspect of our mind is able to tune

2884
01:51:17,520 --> 01:51:22,480
in in some aspect of reality and become

2885
01:51:20,158 --> 01:51:23,759
a master of it and every once in a while

2886
01:51:22,479 --> 01:51:25,439
that means

2887
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:26,960
coming up with breakthrough ideas in

2888
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:27,919
physics

2889
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,079
yeah

2890
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:31,359
how the heck does that happen

2891
01:51:30,079 --> 01:51:33,039
who knows

2892
01:51:31,359 --> 01:51:34,639

conversation i've learned so much about

2896
01:51:38,079 --> 01:51:41,760
isaac newton who's one of the most

2897
01:51:39,840 --> 01:51:43,360
fascinating figures in human history so

2898
01:51:41,760 --> 01:51:45,760
thank you so much for talking pleasure

2899
01:51:43,359 --> 01:51:46,880

thomas kuhn

2906
01:51:58,238 --> 01:52:02,718
a philosopher of science

2907
01:52:00,719 --> 01:52:04,960
the answers you get depend on the

2908
01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,719
