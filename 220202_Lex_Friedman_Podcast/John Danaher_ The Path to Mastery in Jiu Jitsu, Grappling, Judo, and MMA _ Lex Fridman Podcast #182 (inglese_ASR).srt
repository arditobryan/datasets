00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,080
the following is a conversation with

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:07,040
john donahue widely acknowledged

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,719
as one of the greatest coaches and minds

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,879
in the martial arts world

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,559
having coached many champions in jiu

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,560

00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:20,079
mma including gordon ryan gary tonin

chris weidman and george saint-pierre

10
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:26,960
quick mention of our sponsors onnet

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,759
simply safe

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,160
indeed and lynnode check them out in the

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,719
description to support this podcast

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:36,640
as a side note let me say that john is a

15
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,679
scholar of not just jiu jitsu

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:43,280
but judo wrestling muay thai boxing

17
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,960
mma and outside of that topics of

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,439
history psychology

19
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,160
philosophy and even artificial

20
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:50,640
intelligence

21
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,839
as you'll hear in this conversation

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,399
after this chat

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,239
i started to entertain the possibility

24
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,120
of returning back to competition as a

25
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,878
black belt

26
00:00:57,119 --> 00:01:00,320
maybe even training with john and his

27
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:02,718
team for a few weeks

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,760
leading up to the competition for a

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,359
recreational practitioner such as myself

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,760
the value of training and competing in

31
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,519
jiu jitsu is that it is one of the best

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,600
ways to get humbled

33
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,560
to me keeping the ego in check is

34
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:17,759
essential

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,719
for a productive and happy life this

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,920
is the lex friedman podcast and here is

37
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:25,359
my conversation

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,640
with john donahue are you afraid of

39
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:29,118
death

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,239
let's start with an easy question

41
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:34,078
there's no warm-up that's

42
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:36,319
it they're jumping jacks

43
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,519
let's uh let's break that down into two

44
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,078
questions

45
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:40,560
um i'm a human being and like any human

46
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:43,839
being

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,359
i'm biologically programmed to be

48
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,359
terrified of death

49
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:52,078
every physical element in our bodies

50
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:53,359
is designed to keep us away from death

51
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:54,798
i'm no different from anyone else in

52
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:56,799
that regard

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,240
if you throw me from the top of the

54
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,680
entire state building

55
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,078
i'm gonna scream all the way down to the

56
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,399
concrete um if you wave a

57
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,078
loaded firearm in my face i'm gonna

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,598
flinch away in horror the same way

59
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:12,799
anyone else would um so

60
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:13,439
in that first sense of are you afraid of

61
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
death

62
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,800
uh my my body is

63
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:20,000
terrified of injury leading to death the

64
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,920
same way

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,199
in any other human being would so when

66
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,519
death is imminent

67
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,958
there's a terror that goes through the

68
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,439
same adrenaline dumps that you would go

69
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,319
through

70
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:32,560
um uh but on the other hand you're also

71
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,399
asking a much deeper question which is

72
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,560
presumably are you afraid of

73
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,000
non-existence what comes after

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,479
your physical death and that's the more

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,080
interesting question um

76
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:46,479
no uh i should start

77
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,120
right uh by by by scene from from the

78
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,039
start i

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,560
i'm a materialist i don't believe that

80
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,439
we have an immortal soul i don't believe

81
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
there's a life

82
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:55,759
after our physical death um in this

83
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,560
sense from someone who

84
00:02:55,759 --> 00:03:00,479
starts from that point of view you have

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:04,640
to understand that

86
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:06,479
everyone has two deaths

87
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:08,000
we always talk about our death as though

88
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,158
there was only one

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,840
but we all have two deaths there was a

90
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:18,239
time before you were born

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:20,400
when you were dead

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,560
you weren't afraid of that period of

93
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,480
non-existence

94
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
you don't even think about it so why

95
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:28,318
would you be afraid

96
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,920
of your second period of non-existence

97
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,598
you came from non-existence

98
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:33,199
you're going to go back into it you

99
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,598
weren't afraid of the first

100
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:37,839
why are you somehow afraid of the second

101
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:40,238
so it doesn't really make sense to me

102
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,840
as to why people would be afraid of

103
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,799
non-existence you dealt with it fine the

104
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,959
first time

105
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,560
um deal with it the second time but your

106
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,400
mind didn't exist

107
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
for the first death and it won't exist

108
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,319
after you die either

109
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,480
but it does exist now enough to

110
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,399
comprehend that there's this

111
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,479
thing that you know nothing about that's

112
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,840
coming which is non-existent actually

113
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,359
you do know about it because you know

114
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,039
what it was like before you were born

115
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,879
there was just nothing

116
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,318
every every every time you go to sleep

117
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,798
at night you get a sneak preview of

118
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,919
death

119
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:11,360
it's just this kind of

120
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:13,199
nothing happens you wake up in the

121
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,599
morning you're alive again

122
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,519
but it's not about the sleeping it's

123
00:04:15,598 --> 00:04:20,560
about the falling asleep

124
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:23,280
and every night when you fall asleep

125
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,000
you assume you're going to wake up here

126
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:26,319
you know

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,079
you're not waking up and the knowledge

128
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,240
is a whole step from that

129
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:32,000
to the idea of fearing it i'm fully

130
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,079
aware that there's going to be a

131
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,519
time i don't wake up but are you going

132
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,120
to be afraid of it is there some mortal

133
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:37,918
terror you have of this no you didn't

134
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,079
have it before

135
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:40,959
you don't have it when you sleep um

136
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,959
going from

137
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,239
the fact that you know you won't wake up

138
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:45,519
to terror is

139
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,918
two different things that's an extra

140
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,959
step and at that point you're making a

141
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,918
choice at that

142
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,719
at that point what about what some

143
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,560
people

144
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
in our in this context we might call

145
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:59,199
like the third death which

146
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,839
is when um

147
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,439
everybody forgets the entirety of

148
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:05,038
consciousness in the universe forgets

149
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,680
that you've ever existed that john

150
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:08,879
donahue

151
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,319
ever existed so it's almost like a

152
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,918
cosmic death it's like

153
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,599
everything goes yeah not not just

154
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,680
i would say it's like knowledge the

155
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,199
history books forget about who you are

156
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,360
because the history books this is

157
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,360
inevitable by the way we're all

158
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,400
very very small players in a very big

159
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,120
game and

160
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:28,719
inevitably we're all going to go at some

161
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:32,000
point

162
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,440
yeah but doesn't so you're it's it's

163
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,319
disappointing of course like

164
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:37,600
it's um but but it's not even it would

165
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:39,839
be arrogance to say

166
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,360
um i'm disappointed in the idea that i

167
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,638
will disappear but there's this far

168
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,400
greater things than me that will

169
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,439
disappear i mean it

170
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,879
it's crushing to think that

171
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:50,839
there's going to come a time when no one

172
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:52,639
will ever hear beethoven's symphonies

173
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:54,478
again that

174
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,160
the mysteries of the pharaohs will be

175
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,918
lost and no one will even comprehend

176
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
they once existed like

177
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,758
humanity has come up with so many

178
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,959
amazing things over

179
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,280
its existence and to think that one day

180
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,120
this is just all happening on a tiny

181
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:10,638
speck in a distant corner of a very

182
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,120
small

183
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,759
galaxy and among millions of galaxies

184
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,519
that

185
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,879
this is all for nothing okay i can

186
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:18,159
understand there's a kind of dread that

187
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,680
comes with this

188
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:23,199
um uh but there's also a sense in which

189
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
the moment you're born and the moment

190
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,680
you can think about these things you

191
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,160
know this is your

192
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,720
inevitable fate is it so inevitable so

193
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,560
if we

194
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,479
look at we're in austin and there's a

195
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,639
guy named elon musk

196
00:06:32,478 --> 00:06:36,800
and he's hoping in fact that is the

197
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,120
drive behind many of his passions

198
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,639
is the human beings becoming

199
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,959
multi-planetary species

200
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,160
and expanding out exploring and

201
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:47,038
colonizing

202
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,800
the solar system the galaxy and maybe

203
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,719
the rest of the universe

204
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,079
is that something that fills you with

205
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,919
excitement uh it's

206
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:58,959
as a project it's very exciting i um

207
00:06:55,918 --> 00:07:02,560
the whole i mean we all grew up with

208
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:03,598
science fiction the idea of exploration

209
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,399
the same way

210
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:07,519
uh human beings in earlier centuries

211
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:09,439
were thrilled with the idea of

212
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,839
discovering a new world you know america

213
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:12,160
or

214
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,439
some other part of the world that they

215
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,360
sailed to and come back

216
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:17,279
but now instead of sailing oceans you're

217
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,800
sailing solar systems and

218
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,839
ultimately even further um so of course

219
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,160
that's exciting

220
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:25,519
but as far as relieving us from

221
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,400
non-existence it's just

222
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,038
plain a delaying game because ultimately

223
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:30,560
even

224
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:32,318
the universe itself if the laws of

225
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,598
thermodynamics are correct will

226
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,360
ultimately die of course we might not

227
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:40,879
understand

228
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,199
most of the physics and how

229
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:44,879
the universe functions you said laws of

230
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,240
thermodynamics but maybe that's just a

231
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,720
tiny little

232
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,240
fraction of what the universe actually

233
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,879
is maybe there's multiple dimensions

234
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,120
maybe

235
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,360
maybe there's multiple universes maybe

236
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,720
the entirety of this experience

237
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,639
you know there's guys like donald

238
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,160
hoffman i think that all of this is just

239
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,598
an illusion that we don't

240
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,199
like human cognition and perception

241
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,560
constructs a whole it's like a video

242
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,478
game it would construct that's very

243
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,000
distant from the actual reality

244
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:11,918
and maybe one day we'll understand that

245
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,639
reality maybe it'll be like the matrix

246
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,000
kind of thing

247
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,759
so there's a lot of different

248
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,598
possibilities here and there's also

249
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,199
philosopher

250
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,120
named ernest becker i don't know if you

251
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,000
know that is he wrote

252
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,840
denial of death and his idea he

253
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,839
disagrees with you but he's dead now

254
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,918
is is that he thinks that the terror of

255
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,918
death

256
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,360
the terror of the knowledge that we're

257
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:37,439
going to die

258
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,719
is within all of us and is in fact the

259
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,440
driver behind

260
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,440
most of the creativity that we do

261
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,040
exploring out into the universe

262
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:49,440
but also you becoming one of the great

263
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:50,879
scholars of the martial arts the

264
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,920
philosophers

265
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:55,439
of fighting is because you're actually

266
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:58,159
terrified of death

267
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,600
and you want you want to somehow

268
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,079
permeate

269
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,759
like your knowledge your ideas your

270
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,720
essence to permeate

271
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:07,278
human civilization so that even when

272
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,639
your

273
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:13,439
body dies you live on

274
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:14,159
i would agree with him and so far as uh

275
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,640
death

276
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,000
is the single greatest motivator for

277
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,639
action

278
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,080
but going beyond that and saying it's

279
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:24,159
somehow terrifying

280
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,160
that's that's an extra step on his part

281
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,439
um and not everyone's going to follow

282
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:31,199
him on that step

283
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,240
i do believe that death is

284
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,640
the single most important element in

285
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,680
life

286
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:41,759
that gives value to our days if you

287
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:43,278
think for example of a situation where

288
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:46,080
a god came to you and gave you

289
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:46,080
immortality

290
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,360
life would be very very different for

291
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:54,159
you uh

292
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:57,200
you're a talented research scientist

293
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:59,199
you work to a schedule why because

294
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,480
ultimately you know your life is finite

295
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,360
and actually very finite

296
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,440
and could be even more so if fate plays

297
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,959
its hand and you

298
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
die an early death or what have you we

299
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:12,479
never know what's going to happen

300
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,480
tomorrow

301
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,639
as such we get work done

302
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:21,199
as soon as we can the moment you gain

303
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,000
immortality

304
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,879
you can always put every project off you

305
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,039
can always say

306
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:28,320
i don't need to do this today because i

307
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,719
can do it

308
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,680
four centuries from now and as you

309
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,920
extend

310
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,000
artificially a human life the motivation

311
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:39,679
to get things done here and now

312
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,440
and work industriously and and excel

313
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,599
fades away because you can always come

314
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,040
back to the idea that you can do this in

315
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,240
the future

316
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:52,399
and so what gives value to our days is

317
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,799
ultimately death and value

318
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,278
it's not the only form of the reason

319
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:59,919
behind value but a huge part of what we

320
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,000
consider value is scarcity and death

321
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,000
gives us scarcity of days

322
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,120
and is probably the single greatest

323
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,399
motivator for

324
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,679
almost every action we partake in it's

325
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:12,958
kind of tragic and

326
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:15,838
beautiful that what

327
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,159
what makes things amazing is that they

328
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,160
end

329
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:22,799
yeah i think it would actually be a

330
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:26,719
terrible burden to be

331
00:11:22,799 --> 00:11:26,719
immortal you would um

332
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,720
life would be in many ways very hollow

333
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,199
and meaningless i think

334
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,079
people talk about death taking away the

335
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,480
meaning of life

336
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:39,759
but i think immortality would have a

337
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,759
very similar effect in a different

338
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,880
direction

339
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:48,559
so given this short life

340
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:51,200
we could think about jiu jitsu we can

341
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:54,319
think about any kind of pursuit

342
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:57,680
what do you think makes a great life

343
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,720
is it the highest

344
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,039
peak of achievement you know you think

345
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,759
about like an olympic gold medal

346
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:06,639
the highest level of performance or is

347
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,039
it

348
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
the longevity of performance of doing

349
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,240
many amazing

350
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,519
things and doing it for a long time i

351
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,000
think the latter

352
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,078
is kind of what we talk about in at

353
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,720
least american society

354
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,559
you know we want people to be healthy

355
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,519
balanced

356
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,319
perform well for a long time and then

357
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,839
there's

358
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,720
maybe like the gladiator

359
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,920
ethic which is the highest peak is what

360
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,920
defines

361
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,519
you asked an initial question which what

362
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:40,559
makes a great life

363
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,399
but then pointed towards two options

364
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,000
one of longevity versus are there a

365
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,039
degree of difficulty there's got to be a

366
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,039
lot more than that shortly

367
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,399
i mean think about um first of all

368
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,159
we have to understand from the start

369
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,958
there's never going to be an agreed-upon

370
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,000
set of criteria for this is a great life

371
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,559
from all perspective

372
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,679
uh if you look from the perspective of

373
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,518
say machiavelli

374
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,120
then stalin lived a great life he was

375
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,799
highly successful at what he did he

376
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,399
started from nothing so

377
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,319
the degree of difficulty and what he did

378
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:15,759
was extraordinarily high

379
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,720
he had massive impact upon world history

380
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,159
he oversaw the defeat of almost all of

381
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,800
his major enemies

382
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:23,519
he lived to old age and died of natural

383
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:25,439
causes

384
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,799
so from machiavelli's point of view he

385
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,120
had a great life

386
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,039
if you ask the ukrainian farmer in the

387
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,440
1930s whether he lived a great life you

388
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:35,519
get a very different answer

389
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,720
so everything's going to come from what

390
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,399
perspective you

391
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,680
you begin with this you're going to look

392
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,639
out at the world with a given point of

393
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,479
view and you're going to make your

394
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,240
judgments was this a great life or was

395
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,519
this a terrible life

396
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,320
um going back to your point you were

397
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,759
actually

398
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:55,519
i think focusing the question on on more

399
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:58,319
in terms of uh great single performances

400
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,320
versus longevity performances yes

401
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,680
presumably this isn't really a question

402
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,440
about uh

403
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,599
what makes a great life then because

404
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,680
there's so much more than

405
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,040
that to a great life i don't know i'm

406
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:10,958
going to push back on that so

407
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:12,958
i think their parallels are very much

408
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,359
closer than you're making them seem

409
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:16,479
i think let's compare stalin stalin is

410
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,800
an example

411
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,879
of somebody who held power considered by

412
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:23,919
many to be one of the most powerful men

413
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,120
ever he held power for 30 years

414
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,679
so that's what i'm referring to

415
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,159
longevity and then there's a few people

416
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:30,958
i have to i wish my knowledge of history

417
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,519
was better

418
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,799
but people who fought a few great

419
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,120
battles

420
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:39,198
and they did not maintain power but

421
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,720
that's this contrast here for example

422
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:45,838
alexander the great yes who died at 33

423
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:49,278
um from probably unnatural causes

424
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:53,040
um uh had around

425
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:56,320
four to five truly defining battles

426
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:58,240
in his life which uh

427
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,320
responsible for the for the lion's share

428
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:03,278
of of his achievements

429
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,920
and burned very bright but didn't burn

430
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:06,799
long

431
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:08,799
um stalin on the other hand started from

432
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,519
nothing and quietly methodically worked

433
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,319
his way

434
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,320
through the revolutionary phase and uh

435
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,000
gained increasing amounts of power

436
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,639
and as he said um went all the way to

437
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,078
the end of her

438
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,519
uh of his career um yeah there's there's

439
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:26,799
definitely something to be said for

440
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,600
for longevity um

441
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:31,278
but as to which one is greater than the

442
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,278
other you can't

443
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:37,039
give a a definition or um

444
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,879
a set of criteria which will

445
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,360
definitively say this is better than

446
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:40,879
that

447
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,480
but when you look ultimately we look at

448
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,159
alexander as great but in a different

449
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,360
way and we look at stalin

450
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,958
i didn't think many people would say sam

451
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,959
was a great person but from the

452
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:53,198
machiavellian point of view

453
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:55,278
he would say he was great also

454
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:56,399
but when you think about beautiful

455
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:59,519
creations

456
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:03,120
done by human beings in the space of

457
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:06,159
say martial arts in the space of sport

458
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,759
what inspires you the peak of

459
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:08,399
performance i i see where you're coming

460
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,560
from like

461
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,919
it's a great question um for me it

462
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,479
always comes down to

463
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:16,000
degree of difficulty but things are

464
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:20,320
difficult in different ways

465
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,919
okay um a single flawless

466
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,600
performance in youth is still

467
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:26,958
that wins a gold medal let's say for

468
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,240
example um

469
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,758
uh nadia komenichi won the olympic gold

470
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,680
medal in gymnastics the first person

471
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,480
ever to get a perfect score

472
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,919
um if she had disappeared after that we

473
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,759
would still remember that as

474
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,039
an incredible moment and the degree of

475
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,879
difficulty to

476
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,159
to get a perfect score in olympic

477
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:47,919
gymnastics is

478
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,198
just off the charts um and contrast that

479
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,919
with someone who went to

480
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,719
four olympics and got four silver medals

481
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:54,319
i mean they're both

482
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,920
incredible achievements they're just

483
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,440
different

484
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,278
the the attributes that lead to

485
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,120
longevity um

486
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:03,039
typically tend to conflict with the

487
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,679
attributes that bring

488
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:06,078
a powerful single performance one is all

489
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,880
about

490
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:09,198
focus on on a particular event the other

491
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,760
is

492
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,120
uh on spreading your resources over time

493
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,038
both that present tremendous

494
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,639
difficulties

495
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,558
there's no need to say one is better

496
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,160
than the other there's also just

497
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:27,599
for me personally the stories of the

498
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,600
of somebody who truly struggled are

499
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:31,439
are the most powerful i know a bunch of

500
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:33,519
people don't necessarily agree because

501
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,000
you said perfection

502
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,038
perfection is kind of the antithesis of

503
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,440
struggle

504
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:40,079
but i look at somebody okay my own life

505
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,840
somebody i

506
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,439
i'm a fan oh i'm a fan of everybody i'm

507
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,639
a huge fan of yours i'm trying not to be

508
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,720
nervous here but

509
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,880
uh somebody i'm a fan of in the judo

510
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,960
world is travis stevens

511
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,480
he's a remarkable fella by the way a

512
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,279
remarkable human being

513
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
insane in the best kinds of ways i think

514
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:59,200
i started judo i

515
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,720
i really started martial arts i have

516
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,279
wrestled if you consider those martial

517
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,000
arts that's

518
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:04,720
my that's been in my blood i'm russian

519
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,558
so

520
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,720
but beyond that you know the the whole

521
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,599
pajama thing we wear the ghee

522
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,640
i started by watching travis in 2008

523
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,279
olympics

524
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,640
was that accidental did you know travis

525
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,960
prior to watching no no

526
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,720
i just tuned in now that's an unusual

527
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,160
choice it was just random you just tuned

528
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,079
in and you saw travis stevens

529
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,160
i tuned into the olympics and i was

530
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:30,000
wondering what judo is

531
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:32,080
and then s i started watch

532
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,679
we're we're all proud of our countries

533
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:36,798
and so on so i started watching

534
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:40,880
he was i think the only american

535
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:44,000
in the olympics for judo uh maybe the

536
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,000
so this kayla harrison was 2012. and

537
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,279
ronda was there too so i watched rhonda

538
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,640
and travis

539
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:52,240
but obviously sort of i was i was

540
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
focused on somebody who also weighed the

541
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,839
same as i did so there was a kind of

542
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,640
i think 81 kilograms so there's a

543
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,558
connection

544
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,000
but also there's an intensity to him

545
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:06,319
like he would get

546
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,759
like angry at his own failures and he

547
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,639
would just refuse to quit

548
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:11,200
it's that kind of dan gable mentality i

549
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,520
just

550
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,440
that was inspiring to me that he's the

551
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,000
underdog and the way people talk about

552
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,038
him

553
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,319
the commentators that it was an unlikely

554
00:19:19,038 --> 00:19:24,000
person to do well

555
00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:26,319
right and i they the fu attitude

556
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,200
behind that saying no i'm gonna still

557
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:29,839
win gold

558
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,400
obviously he didn't do well in 2008 but

559
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,759
that

560
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:36,640
was the that was somehow inspiring and

561
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:38,720
i just remember he pulled me in but then

562
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,000
i started to see this

563
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,200
sport i guess you can call it

564
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,359
of effortlessly

565
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,400
dominating your opponent and like

566
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:50,879
throwing

567
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,080
because i in to me wrestling was like a

568
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,200
grind

569
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:56,960
you kind of control you slowly just

570
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:00,480
break your opponent

571
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,279
the idea that you could with like a foot

572
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,798
sweep

573
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,079
was fascinating to me that just because

574
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:09,440
of timing

575
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,480
you can take these like monsters giant

576
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,000
people

577
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,640
like incredible athletes and just smash

578
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,279
them

579
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,038
with it it just doesn't there was no

580
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:20,798
struggle to it it was always like a look

581
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,759
of surprise judo

582
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:25,119
dominance in judo has a look like the

583
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,519
other person is like what

584
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,279
what just happened yes this is very

585
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,359
different from wrestling it's built into

586
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:32,558
the rule structure too the whole idea of

587
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,759
an epon of a

588
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:38,480
match being over in an instant and um

589
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,839
that creates a a thrilling spectator

590
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,000
sport because

591
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,319
you can as you say with usherwise or the

592
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,798
footsweeps

593
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,678
you can take someone out who's heavily

594
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,639
favored

595
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:52,720
and if you're not judo is the most

596
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,320
unforgiving of all the grappling sports

597
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,319
you can if you have a lapse of

598
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:59,839
concentration for half a second

599
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:02,720
it's done it's over um if those guys get

600
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:05,599
a grip on each other

601
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,400
any one of them can throw the other the

602
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,480
the idea

603
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:14,159
you know uh when you see someone like um

604
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,480
nomura who won three olympic gold medals

605
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:17,919
to

606
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,759
to win across three olympics and that's

607
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,600
an incredible achievement given

608
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,839
how many ways there are to lose in the

609
00:21:21,599 --> 00:21:26,879
standing position in judo and how

610
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:29,839
unforgiving it is as a sport it shows an

611
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,679
incredible level of dominance

612
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:33,918
i think when i was i was also introduced

613
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,720
at that time

614
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,960
to the idea jessica judo i think in

615
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,720
jiu-jitsu is the same

616
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,360
a lot of sports is probably the same is

617
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,640
there's ways to win that include

618
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:49,678
kind of um if i were to use a bad

619
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,200
term stalling which is like use strategy

620
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,120
to slow down

621
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,120
to destroy all the weapons your opponent

622
00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:58,319
has and just to wait it out

623
00:21:55,119 --> 00:22:00,239
to sort of break your opponent by

624
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,759
yeah shutting down all their weapons but

625
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,400
not using any of your own

626
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:08,319
yes and now travis was always going for

627
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,320
he's off of course really good at

628
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:12,798
gripping and con to that whole game but

629
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:15,439
he was going for the big throws

630
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,918
and he was almost getting frustrated uh

631
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:20,320
by

632
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:23,520
a lot of the opponents i remember uh

633
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:25,279
ola bishop i think yes uh from germany

634
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,519
from germany very talented

635
00:22:25,279 --> 00:22:29,200
very incredible i know he's very good at

636
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,480
doing big throws and he's incredible

637
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,480
judoka but

638
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,079
he was also incredible at just

639
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,159
frustrating his opponents with like

640
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:38,399
gripping and strategy and so on

641
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,520
and i just remember feeling the pain of

642
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,559
this person

643
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:44,480
like travis who went through just he

644
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:46,480
broke like every part of his body he

645
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,640
went through so many injuries

646
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,919
just this person who dedicated his

647
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,159
entire life

648
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:57,200
to this moment in 2008 and then 2012 and

649
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,240
in 2016 just ever gave everything you

650
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,240
could see it on his face

651
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:04,399
that you know his weapons are being shut

652
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:06,240
down

653
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,559
and he's still pushing forward he's

654
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,279
still with that both the frustration

655
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:12,558
and the power i mean the the the kind of

656
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:14,879
throw he does

657
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:15,599
is the his his main one i think is the

658
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,600
standing

659
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,719
was called tsunagi keep on saying i can

660
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,319
hit pause

661
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,038
that was that was the other thing is

662
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:26,480
like the techniques he used

663
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:27,519
was the these big throws that

664
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,839
there's something to me about the

665
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,798
synagogue i fell in love with that throw

666
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:34,399
uh that's my become my main throw

667
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:36,079
standing sanagi

668
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,600
that is like why do why do you favor the

669
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:39,599
standing variation because of the

670
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,359
amplitude

671
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:46,079
you get a more powerful yeah power

672
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:47,519
it's like are you a fan of koga yes

673
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,639
that's so that's why

674
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:54,158
travis so koga and travis opened up

675
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,919
my uh travis uses the same gripping

676
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,080
patterns for saying i guess

677
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:59,520
all the same and the way he uses his

678
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:01,519
hips and turns

679
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,679
and i remember like going to my judo

680
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:05,440
club and other judo clubs and

681
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,120
ask and they're all saying this is the

682
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,640
wrong way to do it

683
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:09,918
the way travis does is the wrong way to

684
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,360
do it and i remember like i've always

685
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,919
been amazed by this by the way

686
00:24:11,359 --> 00:24:15,759
i don't mean to cut you off but i i

687
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:20,159
could literally

688
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:23,200
fill 20 hours of reproductions of people

689
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,080
who will tell me that

690
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:27,360
either my students or other great world

691
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:31,038
champions

692
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:35,199
um are doing things wrong yeah and

693
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:37,200
i'm i'm looking at them and i'm like

694
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:39,360
who would i rather trust here in in

695
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,080
their judgment

696
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:42,798
koga who was one of the greatest

697
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:46,149
throwers

698
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,759
of all time or you

699
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,798
[Laughter]

700
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:51,919
a recreational guy who couldn't throw my

701
00:24:50,798 --> 00:24:55,679
grandmother yes

702
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:59,360
um uh i'm supposed to take your word

703
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,480
over his well say don't listen to what

704
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:01,759
people say

705
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,400
i'm going to give you a piece of advice

706
00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:07,440
here watch what the best people

707
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,679
do okay that's how you get

708
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,038
superior athletic performance i'm going

709
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,360
to say that again

710
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:14,798
don't listen to what people say watch

711
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,479
what they do

712
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:17,839
particularly under the stress of high

713
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,519
level competition because that's when

714
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,399
you see their real game

715
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:24,000
what they really do under pressure okay

716
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,080
and if you can emulate that

717
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,400
you're going to be very successful i

718
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:31,918
guess what i was frustrated with

719
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,519
to your point is that the argument

720
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,960
against koga is

721
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,639
what he has a very specific body type

722
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,240
and he figured out something that worked

723
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,600
for him

724
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:47,120
thus the statement is that might not be

725
00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:48,158
applicable to you or to the general

726
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:51,199
public of

727
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,480
of uh judo players that want to succeed

728
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:58,558
that by the way at the shallow level

729
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:00,159
might be true might be true the point is

730
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:02,960
there might be a body of knowledge

731
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:06,240
that's yet to be discovered and explored

732
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,880
that koga opened up that i wanted to

733
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,159
understand

734
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:12,000
why his technique worked

735
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,679
it made no sense to me that with a

736
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,319
single foot like the way you turn the

737
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,720
hip

738
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:17,599
the single foot that steps in why does

739
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,038
that work

740
00:26:17,599 --> 00:26:21,439
because it was actually very difficult

741
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,359
to make work uh for me as a

742
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,640
white belt in the very beginning it

743
00:26:23,359 --> 00:26:26,639
doesn't make sense

744
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,159
like people just they don't they don't

745
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,400
get loaded up onto your hip

746
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,840
anyway for people don't watch koga

747
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,798
highlights watch travis stevens

748
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:35,439
highlights

749
00:26:32,798 --> 00:26:36,879
but the the the details of the technique

750
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,320
don't make sense

751
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,559
but when mastered that it feels like

752
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:44,079
there's something fundamental there that

753
00:26:42,558 --> 00:26:48,480
hasn't been explored yet

754
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:52,798
it's like koga and travis made me think

755
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,079
that we don't know most of the body

756
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:56,400
mechanics involved

757
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:58,000
in dominance in judo like we just kind

758
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,679
of found a few pockets

759
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,200
that work really well the ichimoda

760
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,240
there's these different throws

761
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,519
also i wonder if there's like totally

762
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,079
cool new things that we haven't

763
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:07,918
discovered

764
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,000
and that's saying i gave a little peek

765
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,679
because there's very few people

766
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,079
that i'm aware of that do it the way

767
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:17,200
travis and koga did

768
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:20,960
may i ask you a question yes um

769
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,679
the choice of standing sanagi um i i

770
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,519
should

771
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,480
uh say this for you for your listeners

772
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:25,918
they're probably thinking what the hell

773
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,120
are these two guys talking about

774
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,880
um uh sanagi is one of the more high

775
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,519
percentage throws in the olympic sport

776
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,559
of judah

777
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,558
um probably uh

778
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:39,119
uchimata is probably number one and

779
00:27:36,558 --> 00:27:42,158
variations of sanagi would be

780
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:43,278
in the top five for sure um the basic

781
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,440
choice you have

782
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,839
in modern competition is the more

783
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,919
difficult standing

784
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:51,439
where you literally are up on your feet

785
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,799
and you perform

786
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,480
a shoulder throw that takes your

787
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:58,319
opponent over from a full

788
00:27:54,480 --> 00:28:00,480
standing position the most popular form

789
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,398
of synagi and modern competition by a

790
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,000
landslide is not the standing version

791
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:05,439
it's a drop saying argue where you go

792
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,398
down to your knees um

793
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,679
this means you have a much easier time

794
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,278
getting underneath your opponent's

795
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,399
center of gravity the defining feature

796
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:13,679
of any synagogue

797
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:15,759
is getting underneath your opponent's

798
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,480
center of gravity and lifting them that

799
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,240
ceo

800
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,240
literally means to to lift and carry

801
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:24,640
why did you choose the more difficult

802
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:27,600
version what was your motivation

803
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,640
you know you're a smart kid you know

804
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:30,558
right from the start

805
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,080
that for every standing sanagi there's

806
00:28:30,558 --> 00:28:33,918
20 drops and argues in modern

807
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:34,879
competition one is obviously more high

808
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,520
percentage

809
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:38,880
one obviously works for a wider variety

810
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,558
of body types

811
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,480
uh the number of people who are

812
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,639
successful with standing sanagi is

813
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,558
dramatically lower

814
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,399
and it appears to be a move which is

815
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,918
completely absent in the heavyweight

816
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,558
divisions

817
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,720
and rarely seen in the lightweight

818
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:57,278
divisions

819
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,000
why what was the motivation why did you

820
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:02,558
willingly adopt the less high percentage

821
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,919
over the this would be very interesting

822
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:06,398
percentage i i

823
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,440
i i would love you to break it apart

824
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,439
because um

825
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,880
i apply the same kind of thinking to

826
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,360
basically everything i mentioned you

827
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,320
offline there's these boston dynamics

828
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:18,079
spot robots when i first met spot i

829
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,119
found love

830
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:23,519
i don't understand what exactly but

831
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:24,558
there's magic there and i just got

832
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,720
excited by it

833
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:28,240
and that met that fire burns i want to

834
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,600
work these robots i want to work with

835
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,798
robots

836
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:34,240
i want to i felt like there's something

837
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:36,398
special there that

838
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,000
i could build something interesting with

839
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,079
create something interesting with

840
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,200
and the same with with the same standing

841
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,918
sanagi

842
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,600
from koga and travis i just fell in love

843
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,120
with that technique just even watching i

844
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:47,678
didn't even know what the hell to do

845
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,239
with it

846
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,759
was it aesthetic it's the standing scene

847
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,240
i guess more beautiful in execution

848
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,839
there's no

849
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,759
engine in in my own

850
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,038
let's we're talking about love here

851
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,679
right in my own

852
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,278
definition of aesthetic yes it's not

853
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:05,440
just beauty because you could argue

854
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,278
there's more elegance sort of ichimata

855
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,159
is very beautiful and effortless

856
00:30:07,278 --> 00:30:11,679
i love i love something about the

857
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,440
dominance of it

858
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:18,720
i love the idea in sport

859
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,759
of two people that are the best in the

860
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,120
world

861
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:25,919
and one of them dominating the other

862
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,918
and uh to me the standing say nagi

863
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:32,720
you're lifted off your feet

864
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:35,600
and especially when it's done perfectly

865
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,000
and with really strong resistance from

866
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:40,079
the other

867
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:42,079
person it results in a big slam

868
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,558
and that was like beautiful to me that's

869
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:47,199
the uh alexander carell and like

870
00:30:44,558 --> 00:30:48,000
big pickups i love that it's interesting

871
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,240
though

872
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,679
it's you're correct and so far as you

873
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,679
you're not just going with

874
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,880
aesthetic and the sense of beauty but

875
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,240
also

876
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,880
but you are making uh as it were value

877
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,720
judgments

878
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,840
yes about the throw and that's

879
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:06,798
fascinating to me

880
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:09,199
um because there's two

881
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:10,798
elements to any grappling sport i've

882
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,278
always i'm always

883
00:31:10,798 --> 00:31:14,480
um insistent upon the idea that jujitsu

884
00:31:13,278 --> 00:31:17,119
is both an art

885
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,480
and a science okay it has scientific

886
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:20,000
elements insofar as it

887
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,759
works according to the laws of physics

888
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,640
and lever and fulcrum et cetera et

889
00:31:21,759 --> 00:31:26,398
cetera

890
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,559
um but it also has

891
00:31:26,398 --> 00:31:30,000
an aesthetic element and so far as

892
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:32,798
you're making choices

893
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,319
with technique you're expressing who you

894
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:37,119
are as a person you have

895
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:38,639
10 000 different variations of moves you

896
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:39,678
could use but you're specifically

897
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,120
choosing these

898
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,278
that's an element of choice and

899
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,158
self-expression on your part and insofar

900
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,919
as that is true

901
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,278
combat sports are not just a size but

902
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,759
they're also an art

903
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,319
so most combat sports have this sense

904
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:52,079
which they

905
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,918
have the features of both an art and a

906
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:57,278
science and

907
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:59,919
um it's not just about

908
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:01,599
high percentage in in your case i mean

909
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,360
me personally i'm obsessed with

910
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,038
percentages what what are the ways to

911
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,079
make signs yeah

912
00:32:05,038 --> 00:32:11,119
but that's also choices involved yeah

913
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:14,558
but um but there is an

914
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:17,518
undeniably aesthetic element

915
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:18,879
to martial arts where you as it were

916
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,120
express

917
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,399
who you are as a person in terms of the

918
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,119
techniques you're ultimately going to

919
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,839
choose

920
00:32:23,119 --> 00:32:27,599
does that get in the way do you allow

921
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:28,558
yourself to enjoy the aesthetic beauty

922
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,599
of a technique

923
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,798
of course yeah when i when martial arts

924
00:32:31,599 --> 00:32:34,398
have done well

925
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:36,319
it's the most beautiful sport in the

926
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:37,278
world okay when it's done poorly it's

927
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,798
the ugliest

928
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,880
but but

929
00:32:40,798 --> 00:32:44,639
a beautifully applied submission holder

930
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:47,760
perfect throw a

931
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,000
a superbly set up takedown are among the

932
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:51,759
most difficult

933
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,519
techniques to execute in all of sports

934
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:54,720
and when they're done well they're magic

935
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:56,798
to observe

936
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,278
but do you uh prefer certain techniques

937
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,599
over others because of their

938
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:02,640
like for example i'll tell you for me

939
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,398
chokes

940
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,440
of all sorts with the ghee without the

941
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:10,639
ghee probably with the geese the most

942
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,919
beautiful to me personally

943
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,320
i i value them above all others um

944
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,600
people mostly associate myself and my

945
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:19,038
students with leg locking

946
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,558
they're usually rather surprised to

947
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:22,158
learn that i actually value

948
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:25,440
strangleholds far above

949
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:27,760
leg logs um but

950
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,200
not for aesthetic reasons for

951
00:33:27,759 --> 00:33:30,558
effectiveness we can talk about that

952
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,080
later a few wish

953
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:35,519
well let's step back sorry we drifted

954
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:37,759
awfully far off topic man

955
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,798
this is with i think this is beautiful

956
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:41,599
uh

957
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:43,278
we're drifting along the river of uh

958
00:33:41,599 --> 00:33:45,678
life and martial arts

959
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:46,798
can you explain the fundamentals of jiu

960
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,399
jitsu yes

961
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:51,278
if i couldn't i wouldn't be much of a

962
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:56,319
coach um

963
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:59,519
jiu-jitsu is an art and science

964
00:33:56,319 --> 00:34:00,720
which looks to use a combination of

965
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:04,319
tactical

966
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,038
and mechanical advantage to focus

967
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:08,319
a very high percentage of my strength

968
00:34:07,038 --> 00:34:11,199
against a very

969
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,559
low percentage of my opponent's strength

970
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,878
at a critical point

971
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:16,799
on their body such that if i were to

972
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,279
exert my strength upon that critical

973
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,839
point

974
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,839
they could no longer continue to fight

975
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:30,638
well that's about weapons and defenses

976
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:32,159
but then is there something more to be

977
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,079
said about the set of tools

978
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,200
that are that we're talking about that's

979
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,879
where the art comes in

980
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,439
because ultimately you have a set of

981
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,440
choices and those choices that you make

982
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,240
will be an act of self-expression on

983
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:45,039
your part

984
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,000
some will prefer this some will prefer

985
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:47,199
that

986
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,358
that's where you come in as an

987
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,918
individual that's an overall definition

988
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:55,279
of jiu jitsu

989
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:55,279
of being a set of choices

990
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:01,519
that where you're

991
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,000
using the things you're powerful in

992
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:05,119
versus

993
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,800
the things your opponent is weak in no

994
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,480
i was only talking about percentages of

995
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,519
body strength if i have

996
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,838
for example let's say um we have two

997
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:16,880
athletes athlete a and athlete b

998
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:18,799
athlete a has 100 units of strength

999
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,559
however we define that overall

1000
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:24,880
athlete b has 50. okay so ostensibly

1001
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:26,239
athlete a is twice as strong as athlete

1002
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,358
b

1003
00:35:26,239 --> 00:35:33,199
but athlete b can maneuver his body

1004
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,159
into a set of positions focused around a

1005
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,480
critical point

1006
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,358
of his opponent's body where he can

1007
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,679
apply

1008
00:35:37,358 --> 00:35:41,039
40 units of strength out of his total of

1009
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:43,759
50.

1010
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,759
his opponent can only defend with 20

1011
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:49,920
units of strength out of his total

1012
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,560
of 100 you have now completely reversed

1013
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,720
the strength discrepancy originally

1014
00:35:52,559 --> 00:35:57,199
athlete a was twice as strong as b

1015
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:59,039
now on that one localized point the knee

1016
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,199
the elbow the neck

1017
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,639
b is now twice as strong as a under

1018
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:06,719
those circumstances

1019
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:08,480
b should win i guess what i'm trying to

1020
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,480
get at by the way that's really

1021
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,199
beautifully said

1022
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,480
is what you just said could be applied

1023
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,118
to

1024
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:18,639
other games other battles it could be

1025
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,119
applied to the game of chess

1026
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:22,319
uh it could be applied to war most

1027
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,440
obviously in war

1028
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:27,200
i think about for example um

1029
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,920
the american strategic bombing campaign

1030
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:29,919
in world war ii

1031
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,760
the eighth army air force was tasked

1032
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,240
with the idea of destroying german

1033
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,240
industry

1034
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,000
did they attack all of german industry

1035
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,119
of course not

1036
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,199
that would be stupid they attacked the

1037
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,358
ball bearing industry

1038
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:53,039
why because almost all

1039
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:54,639
of modern machines require ball bearings

1040
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,480
in order to operate

1041
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:57,759
in order for the mechanical interfaces

1042
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,358
of machines to operate you have to

1043
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,800
reduce friction it's done through ball

1044
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:04,799
bearings

1045
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:06,560
if you knocked out one tiny component

1046
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,400
of german industry the ball bearing

1047
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:10,799
industry the rest of it

1048
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,400
couldn't operate so too with the human

1049
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,039
body i didn't have to fight your whole

1050
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,838
body

1051
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:17,279
i just have to fight your left knee if i

1052
00:37:15,838 --> 00:37:19,599
can break your left knee the rest of

1053
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,720
your body is irrelevant to me

1054
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:26,880
but then isn't the art of jiu jitsu

1055
00:37:22,719 --> 00:37:29,919
discovering the the left knee

1056
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,920
the discovering the weak points

1057
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,358
you know a huge part of jiu-jitsu is

1058
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,039
understanding the weak strengths and

1059
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,199
weaknesses of the human body

1060
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:38,639
there's parts of the human body that are

1061
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,679
shockingly robust

1062
00:37:38,639 --> 00:37:42,480
and there are other parts that are

1063
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:45,039
shockingly vulnerable the major joints

1064
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,400
and of course the most vulnerable of all

1065
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:48,880
the unprotected neck

1066
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,480
so if we take the something i'm not

1067
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:52,800
familiar with but i was incredibly

1068
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,159
impressed by is the body lock

1069
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,160
that i saw um

1070
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,799
nick rodriguez nick rodriguez used last

1071
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,960
time a few weeks ago

1072
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,640
but then i also got to hang out with

1073
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,159
craig jones who

1074
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:09,920
also has a very good body loan so that

1075
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:12,399
that was uh i don't know if this body

1076
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:15,599
lock applies to all positions but i was

1077
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:19,358
seeing it from when craig is uh

1078
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,440
on top of your opponent

1079
00:38:19,358 --> 00:38:23,920
and trying to pass the go or passing the

1080
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,720
guard use the body lock as a controlling

1081
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,440
position

1082
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,399
the the principle behind it is that it

1083
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,960
shuts down

1084
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:36,000
as you've spoken about it shuts down

1085
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:38,400
the weapons of a very strong opponent

1086
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,119
that's absolutely correct in the case of

1087
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,800
um

1088
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,599
guard possession what makes god position

1089
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,200
dangerous what makes someone a powerful

1090
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,960
guard player

1091
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:52,159
is the movement of their hips forward

1092
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,880
and backward and side to side

1093
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:55,920
body locking is designed to shut down

1094
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,920
that movement

1095
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,000
and does a very fine job of it you'll

1096
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,639
see all of my students accelerate gordon

1097
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,079
ryan is probably the single best body

1098
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:06,159
dog guard passer i've ever seen

1099
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:07,519
nikki ryan is outstanding with it nick

1100
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:09,519
rodriguez is very good

1101
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,679
craig jones is outstanding all of my

1102
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:12,800
students use this for a very simple

1103
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:15,199
reason

1104
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,560
understand what is the central problem

1105
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,719
of shutting down a

1106
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:20,000
dangerous guard player it's his hips

1107
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:21,439
that's what makes him a dangerous leg

1108
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,920
locker you go up against a dangerous leg

1109
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,480
lock him

1110
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,358
body lock guard pass single best way to

1111
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,400
shut down

1112
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:30,799
most of his entries um

1113
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,680
we're all strong in leglogs so in our

1114
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,000
gym

1115
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:35,519
you gotta control the hips as soon as

1116
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,880
possible these can otherwise can be a

1117
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:40,960
very difficult thing to avoid

1118
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,838
leg entanglements as you go to parts and

1119
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,720
across the board my students excel in in

1120
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:47,679
uh

1121
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:49,358
in body lock guard passing they

1122
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:51,039
understand what's the most dangerous

1123
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:52,159
feature their opponent has the lateral

1124
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,400
movement of their hips

1125
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,679
what's the single best way to stop that

1126
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,320
body lock and then

1127
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,960
work from there so if this asymmetry of

1128
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,519
power

1129
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,639
is fundamental to jiu jitsu how do you

1130
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:05,280
discover that how do you

1131
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,000
how did you discover the body life that

1132
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,200
as a

1133
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,639
as one of many methodologies of

1134
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,639
achieving this asymmetry

1135
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:14,400
um it would be an overstatement to say

1136
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,838
we discovered the body line right body

1137
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,880
law passing has been around

1138
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:20,159
longer than we've been around um but

1139
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:22,240
what i would say is that

1140
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,598
in a room full of dangerous leg lockers

1141
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:24,959
you've got to have a way to shut down

1142
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,400
the hips

1143
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,519
and so once we started using body locks

1144
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,920
we saw that was one

1145
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:35,519
excellent way to get around that problem

1146
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:37,119
as with all development it comes from

1147
00:40:35,519 --> 00:40:40,318
trial and error

1148
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,079
you will often see people teach the

1149
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,239
technique to a certain level and

1150
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,599
you see the teaching you know there's a

1151
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:47,358
lot of inadequacies there

1152
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,960
and that doesn't cover a lot of the

1153
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,199
problems that we're encountering

1154
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:53,838
and so trial and error is the single

1155
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:57,118
most important part of the development

1156
00:40:53,838 --> 00:40:58,559
trial and error in um in the training

1157
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,920
room amongst ourselves

1158
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:03,119
in in hard training or no it never

1159
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,480
begins with hard training

1160
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,000
or everything techniques are born the

1161
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,519
same way we're born

1162
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,519
weak and in need of nutrition

1163
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:16,800
uh you have to like this build them up

1164
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:18,639
organically like children

1165
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,400
and you start with minimal resistance

1166
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:22,000
and you make progress over time

1167
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,000
when you first go to the gym do you put

1168
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,920
500 pounds on the bench press and try to

1169
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,400
bench press it no you'll be killed

1170
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,760
you start off with the bar you build

1171
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,358
over time and then one day

1172
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,040
five years from now perhaps you really

1173
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,799
are lifting 500 pounds

1174
00:41:33,039 --> 00:41:37,759
but only a four would attempt that on

1175
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,760
their first attempt

1176
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,160
and they're born like children in your

1177
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,280
mind first like

1178
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:47,039
uh there's a spark of another one it's

1179
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,280
like scientific development

1180
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,279
on a subject matter which is

1181
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,119
intrinsically simpler

1182
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:58,880
okay there's a sense in which

1183
00:41:55,119 --> 00:42:00,400
naive and overly simplistic assessments

1184
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,640
of scientific method

1185
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,000
may not work well at advanced levels of

1186
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:05,358
science but they work damn well in the

1187
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,400
training room with jiu-jitsu

1188
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,799
whether the subject matter is inherently

1189
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,240
simpler than it is in research science

1190
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:16,000
and as a result

1191
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:17,679
there'll be a spark you'll see something

1192
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,079
right and there's possibilities there

1193
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:20,318
okay

1194
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,359
let's let's puzzle this out let's work

1195
00:42:20,318 --> 00:42:23,920
with this

1196
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:24,480
and uh you run into a lot of failures

1197
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,159
this

1198
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,760
you know you've suddenly been oh man if

1199
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:29,440
i put my hip this way this works really

1200
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,119
well then suddenly you try and spare and

1201
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,318
you get caught in a simple alma plata

1202
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,358
and you know okay that didn't work as

1203
00:42:32,318 --> 00:42:36,079
well as i thought

1204
00:42:33,358 --> 00:42:37,440
and then you look to rectify things if

1205
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,800
things go on promising research

1206
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:41,280
directions you keep them

1207
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,400
if not you discard them well it's funny

1208
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,240
you say science

1209
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,400
it feels like more like art there's

1210
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:48,399
somebody i really admire

1211
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,680
that talks about this kind of ideas

1212
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,318
johnny i from apple

1213
00:42:49,679 --> 00:42:54,078
he's the lead designer he recently left

1214
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:56,000
but he was the designer

1215
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,359
behind most of the products we know and

1216
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,440
loved from apple

1217
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:01,039
and when you say designer be more

1218
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:05,200
precise what exactly was he

1219
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:06,960
was he working on in apple the iphone

1220
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,239
which which parts of the iphone did he

1221
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,679
would like the

1222
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:12,159
entirety of it was he a leader of a

1223
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,159
research

1224
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:15,679
team or was he the person personally

1225
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:18,799
responsible for their development

1226
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:22,318
he's kind of i would say

1227
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,800
very similar to your position

1228
00:43:22,318 --> 00:43:26,400
he wasn't necessarily the last the

1229
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,318
person executing the fine

1230
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,760
the manufacturer right yeah of course

1231
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:33,199
but there's the

1232
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,560
uh he's somebody that's very hands-on

1233
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,879
and it's it's like okay so he worked

1234
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:40,960
obviously extremely close to steve jobs

1235
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,800
steve jobs has this idea

1236
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,318
we should have a computer that's as thin

1237
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,318
as a sheet of paper

1238
00:43:44,318 --> 00:43:48,239
and then you start to play with ideas of

1239
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:50,318
like what does that actually look like

1240
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,679
the reason i bring it up is because he

1241
00:43:50,318 --> 00:43:54,159
talked about

1242
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:54,960
he had these ideas that he would not

1243
00:43:54,159 --> 00:43:57,519
tell steve

1244
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:58,480
because he he talked about in the same

1245
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:00,318
exact language as

1246
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,920
you're saying is there's like like a

1247
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:04,960
little baby

1248
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,920
that it's very fragile

1249
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,440
it it needs time to grow absolutely and

1250
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:11,680
then steve jobs would

1251
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,559
often roll in was too ruthless you're

1252
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:15,679
too ruthless

1253
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:16,000
this is he would destroy ideas because

1254
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:19,039
uh

1255
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:21,119
johnny ive and the team

1256
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,119
didn't have actually good responses to

1257
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,039
the criticism at first

1258
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:26,880
because when they're babies you can't

1259
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:29,599
defend the baby

1260
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:31,599
uh but you needed time to develop you

1261
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,720
need to sleep on it you need to rethink

1262
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:34,880
it to do dream

1263
00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:36,318
things and all those kinds of things

1264
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:37,358
it's fascinating you say this lex

1265
00:44:36,318 --> 00:44:39,759
because this is

1266
00:44:37,358 --> 00:44:41,519
actually the entire history of

1267
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:44,720
scientific development is

1268
00:44:41,519 --> 00:44:46,159
literally the story of the juxtaposition

1269
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:50,078
between the need

1270
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:52,719
to protect and nurture new theories

1271
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:53,119
versus the need to rigorously test them

1272
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,480
with

1273
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:58,079
with harsh testing that either verifies

1274
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,480
them or falsifies them

1275
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,000
and learning to find a satisfactory

1276
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,400
compromise between those two

1277
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,599
is a very very difficult thing when you

1278
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,440
look at the

1279
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:10,559
history of science you will see that

1280
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:12,880
there's some pretty damn chaotic moments

1281
00:45:10,559 --> 00:45:14,239
anytime there's major theory change

1282
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,160
where

1283
00:45:14,239 --> 00:45:21,679
all kinds of apparently um

1284
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:22,318
uh undesirable tricks they use to

1285
00:45:21,679 --> 00:45:24,879
protect

1286
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,000
certain theories with ad hoc hypotheses

1287
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:29,358
etc etc

1288
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,039
and uh and ultimately

1289
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:36,400
only time and

1290
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:37,679
success over time will justify a theory

1291
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,519
there's usually a period where

1292
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:40,719
when one theory goes in to replace

1293
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:43,199
another there's

1294
00:45:40,719 --> 00:45:44,879
something of a battle between competing

1295
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:46,719
uh groups of scientists some of whom

1296
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,760
advocate theory a some who advocate

1297
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:50,879
theory b

1298
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,960
they often use seemingly

1299
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,800
unscrupulous methods to protect or

1300
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,920
attack another person's theory they dig

1301
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,240
for proofs

1302
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,039
and usually some period of time has to

1303
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:00,959
go by

1304
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:03,119
sometimes in some cases it simply

1305
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,119
involved older scientists protecting an

1306
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,480
initial theory dying off

1307
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:11,838
and new scientists just

1308
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:14,159
replacing them with numbers and

1309
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:16,318
this is a common common theme and the

1310
00:46:14,159 --> 00:46:18,719
same applies in jujitsu you know

1311
00:46:16,318 --> 00:46:20,159
so many times especially when i first

1312
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:22,399
started working with leglocks i would

1313
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,399
show

1314
00:46:22,639 --> 00:46:26,078
things i had worked on to

1315
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:30,880
even world champion black belts they

1316
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,919
would try it once or twice

1317
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,599
and fail be like it doesn't work and

1318
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,599
we're like

1319
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:39,760
you tried it once on it on another guy

1320
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,039
who's also a world champion who

1321
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:45,520
has a strong ability to resist it and

1322
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:46,318
that's it no more it doesn't work and

1323
00:46:45,519 --> 00:46:48,318
then

1324
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,159
uh five years later they would see my

1325
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:52,159
students

1326
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,318
finishing world champions with it and in

1327
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,639
some cases finishing the very people

1328
00:46:54,318 --> 00:46:57,599
who said that the technique would never

1329
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,639
work

1330
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:02,160
i mean if there was ever a refutation of

1331
00:47:00,639 --> 00:47:03,199
a statement that that's a pretty clear

1332
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:07,759
example

1333
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:10,000
um and there has to be a sense in which

1334
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:11,599
you you can't be too forgiving you have

1335
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:13,039
to test hypotheses

1336
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:15,760
but on the other hand you can't be too

1337
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:19,039
ruthless either you have to

1338
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:22,480
look for uh promise and and uh

1339
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,079
my advice is start slow like again

1340
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,599
the analogy of lifting weights you don't

1341
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,640
lift the heaviest weights on your first

1342
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:29,838
day you build up

1343
00:47:26,639 --> 00:47:32,159
you work progressively over time um

1344
00:47:29,838 --> 00:47:34,480
now you also have to have some common

1345
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,318
sense here you can't be too forgiving to

1346
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,280
a technique if it's repeatedly failing

1347
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:40,800
then and good people have tried it and

1348
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,720
multiple good people have tried and it's

1349
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,800
just not working out then okay

1350
00:47:42,719 --> 00:47:46,318
it's time to dismiss it but don't be too

1351
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,119
quick you know

1352
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:50,000
is this where your idea of uh training

1353
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,480
with lower

1354
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,239
belts yeah quite a bit comes from yeah

1355
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,039
i've actually just as a side comment and

1356
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:58,479
maybe you can

1357
00:47:55,039 --> 00:48:01,599
elaborate i the the place

1358
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,199
the gym uh balance studios with the phil

1359
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:04,880
and rick mcglarees where i got my black

1360
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:06,558
belt where i grew up as a jiu jitsu

1361
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,559
person in philadelphia

1362
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,800
they have a huge number of black belts

1363
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:14,240
but they have a huge number of

1364
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:17,039
all other ranks and the way they picked

1365
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:18,078
sparring partners people you train with

1366
00:48:17,039 --> 00:48:19,920
is very ad hoc

1367
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,920
it's very loose it's very one of those

1368
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,280
places one of those gyms where you can

1369
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,760
just kind of

1370
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,480
you can train for like three four hours

1371
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,800
and it's great

1372
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,880
you could take a break or you could jump

1373
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,880
back in very informal yeah and you can

1374
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:34,000
go to war with black belts but then you

1375
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,599
can also

1376
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,039
play around with the purple and the blue

1377
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,880
belts and so on excellent

1378
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:41,358
and that was really beneficial for

1379
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:43,119
growth and you know you can pick

1380
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:44,558
which because everybody has a style you

1381
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:45,838
can pick which style you really want to

1382
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:50,000
work on right

1383
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:51,599
and then i came to um uh boston broadway

1384
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,599
jiu jitsu

1385
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:54,960
with john clark who i love he's a good

1386
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,440
friend but

1387
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,079
you know the it's a little bit more

1388
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,519
formal

1389
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,359
and i found myself it's a very

1390
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:03,759
interesting journey if i would be

1391
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:06,558
training with black belts the whole time

1392
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,839
and uh it was a very different

1393
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,640
experience

1394
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,558
i found myself exploring much less i

1395
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,558
found myself

1396
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,240
learning much less i mean part of that

1397
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:19,359
is on my on me

1398
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:23,039
but part of it was also realizing that

1399
00:49:19,358 --> 00:49:24,880
uh wow there's a value to training with

1400
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,358
people that are much worse than you

1401
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,720
yes is there is there a philosophy you

1402
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:31,920
could speak to on that yeah

1403
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:33,679
um you probably know it already um you

1404
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,639
know from your studies and artificial

1405
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,078
intelligence that

1406
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,239
all human beings are naturally

1407
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,280
risk-averse this is a

1408
00:49:38,239 --> 00:49:44,000
bias which is deeply seated in

1409
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:46,240
in all of us i'm sure you're you're well

1410
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:48,960
read on people like duversky and etc

1411
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,919
who talk about this all the time for

1412
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,480
your viewers

1413
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,318
uh there are numerous psychological

1414
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:55,519
experiments that have shown that most

1415
00:49:54,318 --> 00:49:59,039
people

1416
00:49:55,519 --> 00:50:02,400
to the point of irrationality fear loss

1417
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:04,719
more than they are excited at the

1418
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,400
prospect of an equivalent gain

1419
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:08,159
so for example if you have a hundred

1420
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,160
dollars in your wallet

1421
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:12,000
you're more worried about the idea of

1422
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:14,159
losing the hundred dollars that you have

1423
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,318
now then you would be excited by the

1424
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:21,199
prospect of gaining a hundred dollars

1425
00:50:16,318 --> 00:50:24,318
that i could potentially offer you um

1426
00:50:21,199 --> 00:50:26,399
this comes out whenever you get black

1427
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:27,679
belt versus black belt confrontations or

1428
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,880
any kind of

1429
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:33,919
similar um skill level whenever you get

1430
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:37,599
similar skill levels

1431
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:39,358
the chances of defeat get very very high

1432
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:40,559
interestingly if you're a white belt and

1433
00:50:39,358 --> 00:50:42,159
you're going against a black belt you'll

1434
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,519
take risks why

1435
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:45,039
because there's no shame in losing to a

1436
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:45,440
black belt when you're a white ball so

1437
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:46,800
you'll

1438
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,119
you'll play more light-heartedly and

1439
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,920
you'll you'll have a more fun role

1440
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,640
but when you have very similar skill

1441
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,880
levels

1442
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:55,759
you're going to come back to what the

1443
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,480
techniques

1444
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:02,319
that are most likely to get you a win

1445
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,760
that number of techniques is usually

1446
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:06,719
pretty small

1447
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,240
and if you're always battling with the

1448
00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:10,799
same tough opponents

1449
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:11,679
every day where if you make even a

1450
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,480
single error

1451
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:17,118
it will cost you that match in sparring

1452
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:20,000
and you don't like losing

1453
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,440
you're going to stay with a very small

1454
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,280
set of moves

1455
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,559
you might get slightly better at their

1456
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,440
execution over time

1457
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:28,960
but you as an individual will not grow

1458
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,639
growth

1459
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:36,079
as it does in organic life forms

1460
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:37,598
comes from small beginnings and builds

1461
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,119
over time

1462
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,640
you can't take an untested untried move

1463
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,559
and get it on a world champion black

1464
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:45,759
belt it's going to get crushed so it's

1465
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:48,480
not ready for that

1466
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,480
it's like a a lion cub being thrown out

1467
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:53,199
into the serengeti plains

1468
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,800
the lion cub is just too small and too

1469
00:51:53,199 --> 00:51:57,039
ineffective it's a lion

1470
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,480
but it's a cub and it's not until it

1471
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:02,079
grows into maturity that it can be a

1472
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:02,079
line that can dominate the serengeti

1473
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:06,719
plains

1474
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:08,799
why i always encourage my students to

1475
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:13,598
play with a variety of belt types

1476
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:16,160
um and spend the majority of their time

1477
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,760
with lesser belts for development

1478
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:19,440
purposes when you're getting closer to a

1479
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,760
competition you obviously want to change

1480
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,920
that

1481
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,280
you want to be getting more a

1482
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:26,400
competitive sense of

1483
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:28,160
of hard work but you must learn to

1484
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,760
divide up your training cycles

1485
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:34,799
into non-competition cycles

1486
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,520
where you're presumably working with

1487
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,359
people who are

1488
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:39,280
slightly lower in leveling yourself and

1489
00:52:37,358 --> 00:52:40,318
in some cases quite a bit lower than

1490
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,280
yourself

1491
00:52:40,318 --> 00:52:44,239
and then competition cycles where you're

1492
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:47,040
working with people much

1493
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:48,239
closer to your own skill level is there

1494
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:50,480
something to be said

1495
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,239
about the the flip side of that which is

1496
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,679
um

1497
00:52:52,239 --> 00:52:55,919
when you're training with people at the

1498
00:52:53,679 --> 00:52:58,719
same skill level

1499
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:59,358
being okay losing to them yes you have

1500
00:52:58,719 --> 00:53:01,598
to see

1501
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:03,119
training for what it is training is

1502
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:05,039
about skill development

1503
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:06,800
not about winning or losing you've got

1504
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:10,639
to you've got to understand

1505
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:12,240
that you don't need to win every battle

1506
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,000
you only need to win the battles that

1507
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:15,679
count and the

1508
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,519
the battles that count are in the world

1509
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:19,519
championship finals okay

1510
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:20,800
that's the one that counts think about

1511
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:21,920
that win

1512
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:23,440
okay that's the one you're going to be

1513
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,119
remembered for you're not going to be

1514
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:27,039
remembered for the battle you lost on

1515
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,720
tuesday afternoon at 3 p.m and some

1516
00:53:27,039 --> 00:53:30,318
nameless gym with some guys that

1517
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:31,679
no one cares about no one's going to

1518
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,440
remember that you're going to be

1519
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:35,838
remembered for your peak performances

1520
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,599
not your everyday performances focus

1521
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:38,558
your everyday performances on skill

1522
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:40,240
development

1523
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,160
so that your peak performances you can

1524
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:44,879
focus on winning

1525
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:45,440
you know i just this is not a therapy

1526
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:48,640
session

1527
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:52,000
but if i could just speak

1528
00:53:48,639 --> 00:53:55,118
every session is a therapy session

1529
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:57,440
there is still an

1530
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:59,440
ape thing in there of course you think i

1531
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,880
don't feel it

1532
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,880
you think everyone in the room doesn't

1533
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,640
feel it because

1534
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:05,920
for example you haven't never seen me

1535
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:08,480
roll

1536
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,639
uh you know when there's people you know

1537
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:11,519
i've seen the look in people's eyes when

1538
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:15,279
they see me

1539
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:17,519
train and they i could see maybe it's me

1540
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:18,720
projecting but they think i thought you

1541
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:20,000
were supposed to be good

1542
00:54:18,719 --> 00:54:22,159
i thought you're supposed to be a black

1543
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:24,880
belt like

1544
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:25,838
that look they're like i'm gonna give

1545
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,079
you some therapy

1546
00:54:25,838 --> 00:54:28,078
okay

1547
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,440
do you know how many people have come up

1548
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:36,798
to me

1549
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:39,039
over the years who have visited

1550
00:54:36,798 --> 00:54:41,519
the training halls that i work in and

1551
00:54:39,039 --> 00:54:44,558
they come up to me and go man

1552
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,599
i rolled with gary tonan i did really

1553
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:48,559
well with him

1554
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:50,838
like like really well really wrong i'm

1555
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,240
like oh that's very very good very

1556
00:54:50,838 --> 00:54:53,759
impressive

1557
00:54:52,239 --> 00:54:55,519
and then i see them talking to their

1558
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:58,960
friends like man

1559
00:54:55,519 --> 00:54:58,960
i tapped out gary toner

1560
00:54:59,679 --> 00:55:05,358
and i'm i'm sitting there going

1561
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,480
yeah and you can see that they're just

1562
00:55:05,358 --> 00:55:08,639
like wow

1563
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:10,000
dude i'm i'm way better than i thought i

1564
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:13,440
was

1565
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:17,679
gary tonin all of my students

1566
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:19,599
um i pushed him in the direction of of

1567
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:21,358
giving up bad positions so that they

1568
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:22,880
practice working getting out of critical

1569
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,078
situations is a huge part of our

1570
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:26,160
training program

1571
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,359
but gary tonan takes that to a level

1572
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:30,318
that just no one else

1573
00:55:27,358 --> 00:55:31,838
even gets close it's it's just amazing

1574
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:35,039
like he will put himself

1575
00:55:31,838 --> 00:55:38,318
in impossible situations where

1576
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:40,480
it's a fully locked strangle

1577
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,159
a hundred percent on with both his arms

1578
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:43,760
behind his back

1579
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:46,318
and he'll try to work out from there

1580
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:48,880
yeah and

1581
00:55:46,318 --> 00:55:52,000
seven times out of ten he does but three

1582
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:55,119
times out of ten he gets caught

1583
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,760
he i'm a huge advocate of handicapped

1584
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,920
training

1585
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,599
where you handicap yourself to work on

1586
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:03,119
skills

1587
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:05,838
he's took that to heart to a level that

1588
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,440
few people i believe can match i just

1589
00:56:05,838 --> 00:56:07,920
wonder what his psychology is like

1590
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,358
because

1591
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,000
it goes back to what we talked about

1592
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:14,318
four legs you have to understand

1593
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,519
its skill development don't take it

1594
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:17,759
personally

1595
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:19,599
um i understand i hear where you're

1596
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:20,240
coming from we've all got what you call

1597
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:22,640
the ape

1598
00:56:20,239 --> 00:56:23,679
reflex where we want to be dominant okay

1599
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:25,199
we all do like

1600
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:27,598
because there's thousands of white belts

1601
00:56:25,199 --> 00:56:28,879
out there that have tabbed gary tonin

1602
00:56:27,599 --> 00:56:30,559
yeah and they're walking around and

1603
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,760
they're people saying online dude i tap

1604
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,920
gary tonan

1605
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:35,359
like gary tonan's like one of the best

1606
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,318
in the world so i'm one of the best in

1607
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:40,159
the world

1608
00:56:36,318 --> 00:56:42,000
and um uh does gary get upset about this

1609
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:43,759
no of course not because gary knows that

1610
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
when it counts on stage he's going to be

1611
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:47,440
going

1612
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,960
100 with a set of skills that very few

1613
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:52,240
people can match

1614
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,798
um he can go into an ebi overtime

1615
00:56:52,239 --> 00:56:57,598
at the 205 pound weight division against

1616
00:56:54,798 --> 00:57:00,798
an adcc champion

1617
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:03,920
starting in a full arm lock position and

1618
00:57:00,798 --> 00:57:04,639
effortlessly get out with no problems in

1619
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,200
seconds

1620
00:57:04,639 --> 00:57:08,879
because he's been in that situation 25

1621
00:57:07,199 --> 00:57:12,719
000 times

1622
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:16,079
with varying degrees of skill opponents

1623
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:18,798
and there's just no panic no fear

1624
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:20,240
he's just doing what he's done so many

1625
00:57:18,798 --> 00:57:24,079
thousands of times

1626
00:57:20,239 --> 00:57:25,598
and that's a fine fine example of a guy

1627
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:26,640
who didn't give a damn what happened in

1628
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,119
the training room

1629
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,480
but when it counted on the stage in

1630
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,960
front of the cameras

1631
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,798
it it kicked in yeah he's he's an

1632
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,119
incredible inspiration actually uh

1633
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:38,318
this he's a practitioner something

1634
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:40,160
you've recently

1635
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:41,599
talked quite a bit about which is uh the

1636
00:57:40,159 --> 00:57:45,199
power of escaping

1637
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:46,798
sort of bad positions uh i think

1638
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:49,039
you've talked about it which is really

1639
00:57:46,798 --> 00:57:52,639
interesting framing is uh

1640
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:54,000
escaping bad positions is one of the

1641
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:57,199
best ways

1642
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:00,159
if not the best way to demonstrate

1643
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:01,279
dominance psychologically over your

1644
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:05,039
opponent

1645
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:07,119
that anything they throw at you

1646
00:58:05,039 --> 00:58:08,639
like their weapons are useless against

1647
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:10,160
you um

1648
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:11,679
there's a little bit of legs friedman

1649
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:15,279
kicking through on this question

1650
00:58:11,679 --> 00:58:18,639
your obsession with dominance is um uh

1651
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:19,280
it's a therapy session it's a therapy

1652
00:58:18,639 --> 00:58:22,318
session

1653
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,000
i'm coming from a wrestling perspective

1654
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:26,000
i think it's not just lex friedman i

1655
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:29,519
think it's dan gable i think it's

1656
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,039
dominant the gary tonan ethic

1657
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:32,719
it just goes against everything

1658
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:36,318
wrestling is about you

1659
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:39,679
never put yourself in a bad position and

1660
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:41,039
the fact this it's uh philosophically i

1661
00:58:39,679 --> 00:58:42,719
don't know what to do with it it's a

1662
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,759
total reframing

1663
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:49,039
of showing dominance

1664
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:51,599
by escaping any bad position

1665
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:53,679
yeah let's talk about the idea of what

1666
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:56,160
what what is the value of escapes

1667
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:56,719
why do i put this in as as the first

1668
00:58:56,159 --> 00:59:00,000
skill

1669
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:04,000
that every jdc student must master

1670
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:07,199
um believe it or not uh

1671
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,199
when i talked about how it

1672
00:59:07,679 --> 00:59:10,719
pertains to dominance that's its

1673
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,519
smallest

1674
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,798
value its greatest value has nothing to

1675
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:19,199
do with dominance

1676
00:59:14,798 --> 00:59:21,838
it has to do with confidence

1677
00:59:19,199 --> 00:59:22,480
you can train someone and teach them

1678
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:25,759
technique

1679
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,039
until you're blue in the face but at

1680
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,000
some point

1681
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:31,759
the athlete in question has to go out

1682
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,159
there on the stage

1683
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:36,400
and pull the trigger when the time is

1684
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:36,399
right

1685
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,760
what's going to give you that ability to

1686
00:59:40,318 --> 00:59:45,759
go from the physical

1687
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:50,079
skills that you've learned to execution

1688
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,079
under pressure is confidence

1689
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:57,599
i always talk about skill development

1690
00:59:56,719 --> 00:59:59,358
and yes

1691
00:59:57,599 --> 01:00:03,119
skill development is the absolute

1692
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:03,119
bedrock of my training programs

1693
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:09,919
but you can't finish at that level

1694
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:11,680
there has to be something more than that

1695
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,358
and you have to go from the physical

1696
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:15,039
element of skill

1697
01:00:13,358 --> 01:00:16,400
into the psychological element of

1698
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:19,838
confidence

1699
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,680
i can teach you an armbar all day

1700
01:00:19,838 --> 01:00:24,239
you can get to a point where you can

1701
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:26,838
flawlessly execute armbars and drilling

1702
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:30,399
and even in a certain level of

1703
01:00:26,838 --> 01:00:33,679
competition but if you believe

1704
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:35,280
that in attempting an armbar on a

1705
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,039
dangerous opponent with good guard

1706
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,240
passing skills say the armbar is being

1707
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:40,239
performed from guard position

1708
01:00:40,318 --> 01:00:43,679
that if the armbar fails and your

1709
01:00:43,039 --> 01:00:46,960
opponent

1710
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:49,759
uses that failure to set up a strong

1711
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:50,960
pass and get into a side pin possibly

1712
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,280
into the mount

1713
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:55,679
and you don't have the ability to get

1714
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:58,480
out of that side panel mount

1715
01:00:55,679 --> 01:01:00,480
you won't pull the trigger on the armbar

1716
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:02,798
and so even though you had all

1717
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:04,000
the requisite physical skills to perform

1718
01:01:02,798 --> 01:01:06,719
the technique

1719
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,719
when push came to shove and the critical

1720
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,358
moment came

1721
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:13,759
you back down you didn't pull the

1722
01:01:11,358 --> 01:01:13,759
trigger

1723
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:20,480
building that confidence is the key

1724
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:21,440
to championship performance and the

1725
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:24,880
single

1726
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,519
best way to do it is to take away the

1727
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,559
innate

1728
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:31,679
fear that we all have of bad

1729
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,200
outcomes that makes us naturally risk

1730
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:35,759
averse

1731
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:37,439
when you don't believe you can be pinned

1732
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,160
when you don't believe your god can be

1733
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,480
passed

1734
01:01:38,159 --> 01:01:42,480
you'll take risks because there's no

1735
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:45,199
downside to your actions

1736
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:46,000
an unpinnable person and an unpassable

1737
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:47,759
person

1738
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,239
doesn't have much to fear in a jujitsu

1739
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,520
match you can come out and fire with all

1740
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:52,719
guns blazing

1741
01:01:51,519 --> 01:01:54,559
because then you know at the end of the

1742
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:56,399
day no one's going to hold you down no

1743
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,720
one's going to pass your guard

1744
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,318
that's your first two goals in jujitsu

1745
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:01,679
they're the most boring goals

1746
01:02:00,318 --> 01:02:03,440
they're not exciting to learn no one

1747
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:04,639
wants to come in and they first met told

1748
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,318
okay you're going to practice escapes

1749
01:02:04,639 --> 01:02:08,159
for the next year of your life i can't

1750
01:02:06,318 --> 01:02:10,000
still go you're kidding me

1751
01:02:08,159 --> 01:02:11,279
but that's what you gotta have that's

1752
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,119
your first skill

1753
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:16,079
and that's what i push upon all of my

1754
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:18,640
students you'll see almost all of them

1755
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,960
are very very strong and escape skills

1756
01:02:18,639 --> 01:02:23,440
they know that if things go wrong

1757
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,240
they can always get out they can always

1758
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:28,240
live to fight another day

1759
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:31,199
and that is what gives them the ability

1760
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:35,759
to attack without fear

1761
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:38,159
i think that is so profound and so rare

1762
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,000
it's so rare to hear this i think it's

1763
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:41,759
because it's the most painful thing to

1764
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:45,440
do

1765
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:48,319
always ask yourself when you enter a

1766
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:52,720
jujitsu match you

1767
01:02:48,318 --> 01:02:54,798
already know ahead of time

1768
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,558
if you're going to lose how you're going

1769
01:02:54,798 --> 01:02:58,719
to lose

1770
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:00,240
okay there's only a certain number of

1771
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:01,838
realistic submissions that work in the

1772
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:03,199
sport of judas who the number is very

1773
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:06,318
small

1774
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:08,558
so ahead of time you already know

1775
01:03:06,318 --> 01:03:10,318
the most likely methods of submission

1776
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,359
loss and jujitsu are going to be things

1777
01:03:10,318 --> 01:03:14,639
like heel hook

1778
01:03:11,358 --> 01:03:17,358
armbar renegade strangle guillotine etc

1779
01:03:14,639 --> 01:03:18,318
just work backwards from that knowledge

1780
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:19,679
so start off

1781
01:03:18,318 --> 01:03:21,759
learning how to defend all of those

1782
01:03:19,679 --> 01:03:23,440
things you know what the major

1783
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:25,280
losing positions are in jiu-jitsu

1784
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,880
someone gets mounted on you rear mount

1785
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:28,720
side control neon valley those are

1786
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,640
positions you can only lose from

1787
01:03:28,719 --> 01:03:31,919
so work backwards from there getting out

1788
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:34,159
of those positions

1789
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:36,240
and that's how i always start i always

1790
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:40,159
say with my students

1791
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:44,000
i teach beginners from the ground up

1792
01:03:40,159 --> 01:03:46,078
and i teach experts backwards

1793
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,000
what does that mean when a young student

1794
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,920
comes to me with no skills

1795
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,318
they learn from the ground up they start

1796
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,400
on their backs defending pins

1797
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:55,599
then they start on their backs working

1798
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,798
from half guard bottom

1799
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:58,960
then on their backs working from

1800
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,239
variations of guard they don't even get

1801
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:02,798
to see top position

1802
01:04:00,239 --> 01:04:03,439
until they're strong off their backs

1803
01:04:02,798 --> 01:04:05,679
then

1804
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:07,599
they go on to their knees and they start

1805
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:09,919
passing

1806
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:12,079
start standing and passing and then they

1807
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:13,440
work their pins and transitions

1808
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:15,280
and then ultimately they stand up to

1809
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,880
their feet and they work

1810
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:19,440
standing position on their feet so they

1811
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,760
work from ground

1812
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,559
back on the floor to ground knees on the

1813
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,319
floor

1814
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,920
ground standing and then both athletes

1815
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:27,679
standing is a gradual progression over

1816
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,798
time where they work from the bottom to

1817
01:04:27,679 --> 01:04:31,440
the top

1818
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:32,719
with regards experts i teach them in

1819
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:34,400
game first

1820
01:04:32,719 --> 01:04:35,919
they must become very very strong and

1821
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:40,480
what finishes the match

1822
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:43,838
which is submission holds okay

1823
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:46,639
in chess we always talk about end game

1824
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,519
i do the same thing in judetsum i start

1825
01:04:46,639 --> 01:04:49,519
experts

1826
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:51,119
just looking at the mechanics of

1827
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:52,559
breaking people and all the

1828
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,559
sufficient holds that i teach you should

1829
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:56,000
know that i teach only a very small

1830
01:04:54,559 --> 01:05:00,160
number of submission holds

1831
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:02,000
around six um it's interesting

1832
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:03,358
my students have by far and away the

1833
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,039
highest submission rate

1834
01:05:03,358 --> 01:05:06,838
in contemporary jiu-jitsu but they only

1835
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,599
learn around six to seven submission

1836
01:05:06,838 --> 01:05:12,719
holds

1837
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,920
i start them with mechanics where they

1838
01:05:12,719 --> 01:05:16,959
learn the end game

1839
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:16,960
how to break someone

1840
01:05:19,838 --> 01:05:28,318
once they develop in their mind

1841
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:31,039
the belief that if the conditional

1842
01:05:28,318 --> 01:05:33,440
if they can get to one of those six

1843
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:36,000
positions

1844
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:37,440
there's a very high likelihood they'll

1845
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:40,639
win

1846
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:42,960
if they truly believe then

1847
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:44,798
when it's competition time they'll

1848
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:46,400
[ __ ] find a way

1849
01:05:44,798 --> 01:05:49,280
to get to those positions that's

1850
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,200
confidence but if you don't believe

1851
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,720
let's say you believe man if i get to a

1852
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:53,838
finishing position an armbar or a

1853
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:55,519
strangle

1854
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:57,038
there's only like a 20 chance i'll

1855
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:58,719
finish with it how hard are you going to

1856
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:02,079
fight to get to that position

1857
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:05,838
you're not why why would you

1858
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:07,200
but if you believe there's a 98 chance

1859
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:10,639
if you get to that position you'll

1860
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:12,639
finish you'll find a way to get down

1861
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:14,960
that is so powerful there are certain

1862
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:16,159
things maybe going back to judo a little

1863
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:18,960
bit as

1864
01:06:16,159 --> 01:06:19,279
the there's a clock choke for people who

1865
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,838
are

1866
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:22,400
listening it's with the ghee when a

1867
01:06:21,838 --> 01:06:25,358
purple

1868
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:27,280
or when a person is in a turtle position

1869
01:06:25,358 --> 01:06:28,719
in a crouching position

1870
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:31,039
and this is something that's done in

1871
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:32,639
judo quite a bit but i have

1872
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,160
doesn't matter what the technique is i

1873
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:36,879
have a belief in my

1874
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:37,440
head that there's not a person in the

1875
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,599
world

1876
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:46,318
that i can't choke with that clock joke

1877
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:50,000
and i've done that and that it was a

1878
01:06:46,318 --> 01:06:51,599
it built on itself the belief

1879
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,079
made the technique better and better and

1880
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,760
better now you're on to something

1881
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:57,440
that's exactly the mindset that i'm

1882
01:06:55,760 --> 01:07:00,559
trying to coach but that's step

1883
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:03,039
one you have to believe that

1884
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:04,319
but you got to stop somewhere and then

1885
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,680
it's step one but then you have to

1886
01:07:04,318 --> 01:07:06,880
create a system but it's a damn

1887
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,118
important step yeah

1888
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:11,599
so you coach the end game first and then

1889
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:13,280
you fill in the details afterwards

1890
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:16,480
yeah that's a huge confidence builder

1891
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:19,119
but i just i have to say

1892
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:20,480
to admit and it makes me sad but i think

1893
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:22,160
i'm not alone i think a

1894
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,599
majority of jiu jitsu people are like

1895
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,719
this that

1896
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,440
uh i didn't do the the beginner step

1897
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:30,719
that you talk

1898
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:33,358
about which is the focusing and escapes

1899
01:07:30,719 --> 01:07:34,239
i think i learned the wrong lessons from

1900
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:37,279
being

1901
01:07:34,239 --> 01:07:38,399
from losing i remember in a blue belt

1902
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,480
competition

1903
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:44,798
long ago one

1904
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:48,639
i was uh i think it was yeah it was the

1905
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:51,199
finals of atlanta ibjf tournament

1906
01:07:48,639 --> 01:07:53,199
and there's a person that passed my

1907
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:57,038
guard

1908
01:07:53,199 --> 01:08:01,038
uh and he took him out

1909
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:03,280
and he stayed a mount for a long time

1910
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:05,520
and i couldn't breathe and it was like

1911
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,319
one of those things where i was truly

1912
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:08,719
dominated

1913
01:08:06,318 --> 01:08:10,639
i don't think i've been dominated just a

1914
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:13,679
match quite like that before

1915
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:14,558
and or after and the lesson i learned

1916
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:17,599
from that

1917
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:20,319
is i'm not gonna let like

1918
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:22,159
as opposed to working on escapes i'm not

1919
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:24,400
gonna let anyone pass my guard

1920
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:26,399
what you learned is don't take risks

1921
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:29,519
don't take risks

1922
01:08:26,399 --> 01:08:31,198
which is ultimately what kills you

1923
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,799
ultimately you become the best you can

1924
01:08:31,198 --> 01:08:35,358
you got to take risks as they say

1925
01:08:32,798 --> 01:08:37,679
nothing risk nothing gained

1926
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,199
failure usually makes us even more

1927
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,239
risk-averse than we started we're

1928
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:42,238
already

1929
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:43,278
mentally biased being human beings in

1930
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:48,399
that direction

1931
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:50,319
and failure tends to reinforce that um

1932
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:52,559
i work hard in my training programs to

1933
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:55,279
try and correct that fold

1934
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:57,359
is it still possible for a person who's

1935
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:59,040
a black ball to to then just go back to

1936
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:02,960
that beginning journey i guess

1937
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:04,079
of course let me tell you something

1938
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,000
i'm probably going to catch a lot of

1939
01:09:04,079 --> 01:09:09,278
flack for saying this i have

1940
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:10,719
a belief i won't say something i won't

1941
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:14,000
call it knowledge because it's not known

1942
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:17,600
but i have a fervent belief

1943
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,439
that human beings in

1944
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:21,838
most skill activities not all skill

1945
01:09:19,439 --> 01:09:24,960
activities but i will say combat sports

1946
01:09:21,838 --> 01:09:25,439
for sure can reinvent themselves in five

1947
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,560
year

1948
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:30,158
periods now you might be saying

1949
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:32,400
five years what's magical about five

1950
01:09:30,158 --> 01:09:32,399
years

1951
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:39,198
mike tyson was 13 years old when he was

1952
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:44,640
taken in by customarto

1953
01:09:39,198 --> 01:09:47,838
by the age of 18 he was beating

1954
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:49,279
world-class boxers in the gym and had

1955
01:09:47,838 --> 01:09:51,359
already made a

1956
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,120
a strong name for himself in

1957
01:09:51,359 --> 01:09:54,159
international boxing it was already a

1958
01:09:53,119 --> 01:09:57,039
known figure

1959
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:57,039
it was five years

1960
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:06,880
yasiro yamashita the judo player

1961
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:10,159
began judo at 13.

1962
01:10:06,880 --> 01:10:13,039
he placed silver and the old japans

1963
01:10:10,158 --> 01:10:13,039
at 17.

1964
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:20,079
i could go on all day with examples

1965
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:24,079
of athletes who within a

1966
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:26,000
five-year time frame of starting a sport

1967
01:10:24,079 --> 01:10:27,840
were competing at world championship

1968
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:31,279
level i'm going to give you

1969
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:32,159
a rough and ready definition of sport

1970
01:10:31,279 --> 01:10:36,079
mastery

1971
01:10:32,158 --> 01:10:39,279
okay i believe that if you can play

1972
01:10:36,079 --> 01:10:39,920
a competitive match against someone

1973
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:44,000
ranked

1974
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:46,158
in the top 25 in your sport

1975
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,760
and it's a serious international sport i

1976
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:49,359
would call you someone who's mastered

1977
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:52,400
that sport

1978
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:54,238
okay you're damn good

1979
01:10:52,399 --> 01:10:56,079
if you can go with the number 25

1980
01:10:54,238 --> 01:10:57,919
wrestler in the world

1981
01:10:56,079 --> 01:10:59,519
and give them a hard competitive match

1982
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,840
in the gym you may not win it but

1983
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:03,600
you know they had a good workout you

1984
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:07,039
have

1985
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,039
shown mastery of wrestling

1986
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:13,119
or indeed any other combat sport you

1987
01:11:09,119 --> 01:11:15,760
care to name

1988
01:11:13,119 --> 01:11:17,039
there are numerous examples of people

1989
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:20,960
doing far better than that

1990
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:23,198
in five years winning

1991
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:26,158
medals at world championships and even

1992
01:11:23,198 --> 01:11:28,319
olympic games in that five-year period

1993
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:30,158
this is not an unrealistic goal there is

1994
01:11:28,319 --> 01:11:31,920
a lot of empirical evidence to show that

1995
01:11:30,158 --> 01:11:33,920
people have done this in the past a lot

1996
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,560
of it

1997
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:37,279
so if you fully immerse yourself in a

1998
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,199
sport

1999
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:41,039
with a well worked out well-planned

2000
01:11:39,198 --> 01:11:42,639
training program there is a mountain of

2001
01:11:41,039 --> 01:11:43,279
evidence to show that in a five-year

2002
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,159
period

2003
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:46,158
you can go from

2004
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:53,279
a complete beginner to a

2005
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:54,480
very very impressive skill level to the

2006
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:57,279
point where you're competitive with some

2007
01:11:54,479 --> 01:11:59,119
of the best people on the planet

2008
01:11:57,279 --> 01:12:00,399
you can reinvent yourself in these

2009
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:01,920
five-year periods

2010
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:03,359
what happens with most people is they

2011
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,199
get to a certain level and they get

2012
01:12:03,359 --> 01:12:06,799
complacent they get lazy

2013
01:12:05,198 --> 01:12:08,238
and they just keep doing the same old

2014
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:10,079
thing they've been doing

2015
01:12:08,238 --> 01:12:11,599
but if you're diligent and you're

2016
01:12:10,079 --> 01:12:14,079
purposeful

2017
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:16,000
five years you can accomplish an awful

2018
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,920
lot and as i said there's a mountain of

2019
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:20,880
evidence to show it

2020
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:22,800
by the way as a small aside somebody

2021
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,400
who's mentioned taversky and yamashita

2022
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:26,000
in the same conversation you're one of

2023
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:27,039
the most impressive people i've ever

2024
01:12:26,000 --> 01:12:31,198
spoken to

2025
01:12:27,039 --> 01:12:33,679
but it's that's a small side uh

2026
01:12:31,198 --> 01:12:36,719
so if if there's this complete beginner

2027
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:39,840
this is really interesting

2028
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,600
there is empirical evidence that you can

2029
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:44,319
achieve incredible things in a short

2030
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,320
amount of time

2031
01:12:44,800 --> 01:12:47,840
there's a complete beginner standing

2032
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:51,279
before you

2033
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:54,719
and that beginner has fire in their eyes

2034
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:58,238
and they want to achieve mastery

2035
01:12:54,719 --> 01:13:00,880
where do you place most of the credit

2036
01:12:58,238 --> 01:13:01,519
for it for a journey that does achieve

2037
01:13:00,880 --> 01:13:03,520
mastery

2038
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,719
is it the set of ideas they have in

2039
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:07,920
their mind

2040
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:09,279
is it the the set of drills or the way

2041
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:13,119
they practice

2042
01:13:09,279 --> 01:13:13,119
is it genetics and luck

2043
01:13:13,359 --> 01:13:16,639
those are all good in science all of

2044
01:13:15,279 --> 01:13:18,559
those factors you've mentioned

2045
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:21,360
play a definite role let's start with

2046
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:21,360
luck okay

2047
01:13:21,439 --> 01:13:27,039
we are all subject to fortune

2048
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,239
and fortune can be good and fortune can

2049
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,560
be bad

2050
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:32,079
uh life is in many ways beautiful but

2051
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:35,120
life is also tragic

2052
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:37,519
and i've had students who showed

2053
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:40,399
enormous promise and just tragic events

2054
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,400
occurred in their lives

2055
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:46,238
the vicitudes of fortune can be

2056
01:13:44,719 --> 01:13:48,399
a wonderful thing in your life and they

2057
01:13:46,238 --> 01:13:52,319
can be a a terrible tragedy

2058
01:13:48,399 --> 01:13:54,719
um i've had students who who died uh

2059
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:56,319
for various reasons who could have gone

2060
01:13:54,719 --> 01:13:58,719
on to become world champions

2061
01:13:56,319 --> 01:13:59,599
i've had students who uh on a much

2062
01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:02,800
lighter note just

2063
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:04,480
fell in love and just wanted to have

2064
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,640
kids and move away and

2065
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:08,399
that's that's a that's a wonderful thing

2066
01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:12,079
but different direction

2067
01:14:08,399 --> 01:14:14,559
um you just never know so luck does

2068
01:14:12,079 --> 01:14:15,600
play some role um even things like where

2069
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:19,600
you're born

2070
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:21,440
uh the location of your physical

2071
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,440
location in the world or even the

2072
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:24,639
socio-economic location can

2073
01:14:23,439 --> 01:14:26,719
can play a role which could be

2074
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:28,719
detrimental or favorable

2075
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:30,239
so yeah luck does play some role

2076
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:31,760
thankfully it's one of the smaller

2077
01:14:30,238 --> 01:14:35,359
elements

2078
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:37,920
and i do believe that a truly

2079
01:14:35,359 --> 01:14:40,719
resourceful mind can overcome

2080
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:41,039
the majority of what fortune throws at

2081
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:43,439
us

2082
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:46,880
and and get two goals provided you're

2083
01:14:43,439 --> 01:14:46,879
sufficiently mentally robust

2084
01:14:47,279 --> 01:14:51,759
other things you mentioned genetics

2085
01:14:49,399 --> 01:14:54,559
[Music]

2086
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,440
i do believe in certain sports genetics

2087
01:14:54,560 --> 01:14:58,560
really do

2088
01:14:55,439 --> 01:15:01,759
play a powerful powerful role for

2089
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:05,760
example in any sport where

2090
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:08,640
power output and reaction speed

2091
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,000
ability to take physical damage then

2092
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:13,280
there are genetic elements which

2093
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:15,840
will help okay for example i

2094
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:17,679
couldn't imagine a world in which even

2095
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,560
if i i have a crippled leg so

2096
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,359
even if i uh grew up in a world where my

2097
01:15:20,560 --> 01:15:23,440
leg was

2098
01:15:21,359 --> 01:15:25,119
was normal and i had normal legs and

2099
01:15:23,439 --> 01:15:28,238
everything was fine with my body

2100
01:15:25,119 --> 01:15:30,399
i don't believe that

2101
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:32,319
i could win the olympic gold medal in

2102
01:15:30,399 --> 01:15:33,279
100 meter sprinting for example okay i

2103
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:36,960
just don't have enough

2104
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:40,880
fast twitch muscle fibers but the more

2105
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:44,158
a sport involves skill and tactics

2106
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:44,800
the less you will see genetics playing a

2107
01:15:44,158 --> 01:15:47,679
role

2108
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:49,199
if you look at the middle podiums in

2109
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,319
jiu-jitsu for example

2110
01:15:49,198 --> 01:15:54,879
you will see that no one body type

2111
01:15:52,319 --> 01:15:55,359
is definitively superior to another you

2112
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:57,760
will see

2113
01:15:55,359 --> 01:16:00,960
every variation of body type and the

2114
01:15:57,760 --> 01:16:03,199
metal platforms and jujitsu

2115
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,880
as skill and tactics become more and

2116
01:16:03,198 --> 01:16:06,799
more important and things like just

2117
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,000
power output over time become less and

2118
01:16:06,800 --> 01:16:11,600
less important

2119
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:13,679
then you will see that um genetics play

2120
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,520
less and less of a role i'm i'm happy to

2121
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,279
say that the sport of jiu-jitsu

2122
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,120
the evidence seems pretty clear that

2123
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:20,719
there's no one dominant body type in a

2124
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:23,039
sport of judas who rather there's just

2125
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:24,319
advantages for one type and there's

2126
01:16:23,039 --> 01:16:25,760
advantages for another

2127
01:16:24,319 --> 01:16:28,639
you just have to learn to tailor your

2128
01:16:25,760 --> 01:16:28,640
game to your body

2129
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:34,880
with regards to training program yes i

2130
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,080
believe with all my heart

2131
01:16:34,880 --> 01:16:39,600
and all my soul that

2132
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:41,198
your training program does make a

2133
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,800
difference i've dedicated my life to

2134
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:46,158
that obviously i'm biased

2135
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:47,600
in this regard um i do believe that all

2136
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:49,119
of the students that i taught

2137
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:50,800
who became world champions would have

2138
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:51,760
been great athletes whether or not they

2139
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:55,360
had met me or not

2140
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:56,880
i believe that but i do also believe it

2141
01:16:55,359 --> 01:16:58,399
would have taken them a lot longer

2142
01:16:56,880 --> 01:16:59,920
and they may not have gotten to the

2143
01:16:58,399 --> 01:17:01,759
level that they did they

2144
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:04,158
i'm sure they would have been impressive

2145
01:17:01,760 --> 01:17:06,000
but i do believe

2146
01:17:04,158 --> 01:17:08,158
that the nature of a training program

2147
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,640
plays an enormous difference

2148
01:17:08,158 --> 01:17:12,399
i don't mean to say this in an arrogant

2149
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:14,640
way i believe that

2150
01:17:12,399 --> 01:17:16,238
there's again a mountain of evidence to

2151
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:17,840
suggest this is true because you see it

2152
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:20,238
in many different sports

2153
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,039
let's talk for example about your

2154
01:17:20,238 --> 01:17:24,718
country

2155
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:24,719
russia and its wrestling program

2156
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:30,079
russia is an enormous country but the

2157
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,400
location

2158
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:34,000
where russia's wrestling program comes

2159
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:35,920
from is actually very small

2160
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,520
and the population is actually very

2161
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,000
small i can't

2162
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,840
verify this but i was told once i can't

2163
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:43,198
verify this but the number of people who

2164
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,000
wrestle in russia is actually

2165
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:45,839
significantly

2166
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,679
smaller than the number of people who

2167
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:50,719
wrestle in the united states

2168
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:52,800
it's also not part of the school uh uh

2169
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,880
athletics and it is in the united states

2170
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,079
yes that's a different point we'll come

2171
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:57,679
back to right to that because that's

2172
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:59,679
also an important point

2173
01:17:57,679 --> 01:18:00,960
but if you look at the actual numbers of

2174
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,000
people there they're actually pretty

2175
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,000
small

2176
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:05,760
so ostensibly if it comes down to a

2177
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:07,760
numbers game america should dominate at

2178
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:09,760
the olympics if we have more wrestlers

2179
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,280
now this the story gets more complicated

2180
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,039
because america has a different

2181
01:18:11,279 --> 01:18:14,880
style of wrestling the collegiate style

2182
01:18:13,039 --> 01:18:18,079
than the international freestyle that

2183
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:18,079
is a complicating factor

2184
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:25,600
but nonetheless uh what you see there

2185
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:27,600
is that numbers on everything rather

2186
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:29,440
the manner in which people are trained

2187
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:33,039
clearly has an impact

2188
01:18:29,439 --> 01:18:34,639
and we know very little about the this

2189
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:36,319
very little reliable information about

2190
01:18:34,640 --> 01:18:39,360
the training program for wrestling

2191
01:18:36,319 --> 01:18:42,079
in uh in the russian states

2192
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:43,839
but one thing is incontestable is the

2193
01:18:42,079 --> 01:18:46,238
amount of success that they've had in

2194
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,560
international world championship and

2195
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:52,079
olympic competition

2196
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:54,640
they are disproportionately successful

2197
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:56,238
despite their relatively small numbers

2198
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:57,280
there's nothing genetically special

2199
01:18:56,238 --> 01:18:59,678
about them

2200
01:18:57,279 --> 01:19:01,519
um you can talk about

2201
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:03,279
performance-enhancing drugs but those

2202
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:04,960
are a worldwide phenomenon

2203
01:19:03,279 --> 01:19:08,319
they don't have any access to technology

2204
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:08,319
that the rest of the world doesn't have

2205
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,359
at some point you've got to start asking

2206
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,399
what are they doing differently in the

2207
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:18,079
training room

2208
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:20,960
and there are many other examples

2209
01:19:18,079 --> 01:19:22,800
of similar situations my country new

2210
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,000
zealand um

2211
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:28,400
has an insanely

2212
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:29,520
successful rugby program the sport of

2213
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:32,879
rugby

2214
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:35,440
which they have dominated for

2215
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,440
literally generations despite the fact

2216
01:19:35,439 --> 01:19:39,359
that our population is

2217
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:40,719
very very small compared with the rest

2218
01:19:39,359 --> 01:19:41,759
of the country and we don't excel in

2219
01:19:40,719 --> 01:19:44,960
many other sports

2220
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,880
it's new zealand does fairly well and

2221
01:19:44,960 --> 01:19:49,520
sports overall but nothing like they do

2222
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,880
in rugby

2223
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,120
and you've got to ask yourself is there

2224
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:56,000
a culture there which which

2225
01:19:53,119 --> 01:19:56,880
built this up and the world is full of

2226
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:00,319
examples

2227
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:02,679
of seemingly small and unpromising

2228
01:20:00,319 --> 01:20:04,079
areas or locations putting out

2229
01:20:02,679 --> 01:20:07,199
disproportionately high

2230
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:10,719
numbers of successful athletes

2231
01:20:07,198 --> 01:20:12,319
and that points to the idea that

2232
01:20:10,719 --> 01:20:15,039
different training programs

2233
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:16,719
have different success rates and so i

2234
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:17,600
truly believe with all my heart and all

2235
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:20,639
my soul

2236
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,000
that how you train does make a

2237
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:23,840
significant difference

2238
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,920
i would even go further and say it makes

2239
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,279
the most difference is it the only thing

2240
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,480
absolutely not we've already talked

2241
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:30,800
about fortune we've talked about

2242
01:20:28,479 --> 01:20:31,919
genetics

2243
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,039
if you want to get nasty you can even

2244
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,800
talk about things like performance

2245
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:36,399
enhancing drugs that obviously plays a

2246
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:40,480
role in modern sports

2247
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:44,238
um uh but i do believe

2248
01:20:40,479 --> 01:20:46,799
that the majority of uh

2249
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:48,879
of what creates success is the

2250
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,239
interaction between the athlete and the

2251
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:52,560
training program

2252
01:20:50,238 --> 01:20:53,919
now the training program is one thing i

2253
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:54,719
do believe that's the single most

2254
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:56,399
important but

2255
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:58,319
right behind it is the athlete

2256
01:20:56,399 --> 01:21:01,759
themselves okay

2257
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:03,519
um in my own experience uh people

2258
01:21:01,760 --> 01:21:04,960
talk about athletes that i've trained

2259
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,920
successfully but they never talk about

2260
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:07,520
athletes that i've trained

2261
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:09,520
unsuccessfully

2262
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:11,600
um always remember that for every

2263
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,280
champion a coach producers there's a

2264
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,120
hundred

2265
01:21:13,279 --> 01:21:16,639
people that they coach that no one ever

2266
01:21:15,119 --> 01:21:20,000
heard of and

2267
01:21:16,639 --> 01:21:23,119
this is completely normal

2268
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,920
a coach can never take the lion's share

2269
01:21:23,119 --> 01:21:27,439
of the credit

2270
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:30,079
a coach creates possibilities

2271
01:21:27,439 --> 01:21:31,279
but it's the athlete who actualizes the

2272
01:21:30,079 --> 01:21:34,559
possibilities

2273
01:21:31,279 --> 01:21:36,639
and so building that rapport and finding

2274
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:38,400
the right people to excel in your

2275
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,279
training program is also a big part of

2276
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:40,839
it

2277
01:21:39,279 --> 01:21:43,519
what makes the difference between the

2278
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:45,840
successful your successes and your

2279
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:49,040
failures as a coach

2280
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:52,159
a range of reasons the single most

2281
01:21:49,039 --> 01:21:54,000
important is persistence

2282
01:21:52,158 --> 01:21:55,679
people will point to all kinds of

2283
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:58,079
virtues amongst athletes this guy's the

2284
01:21:55,679 --> 01:22:00,880
most courageous the sky's the strongest

2285
01:21:58,079 --> 01:22:02,719
these are all virtues but the one

2286
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:05,920
indispensable

2287
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:07,679
virtue is persistence the ability just

2288
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:09,279
to stay in the game long enough to get

2289
01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:11,760
the results you seek

2290
01:22:09,279 --> 01:22:12,559
but what does persistence really look

2291
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,000
like

2292
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,080
if we can just break that apart a little

2293
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:17,520
bit it's actually this is a great

2294
01:22:16,079 --> 01:22:19,760
question you're asking because

2295
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:21,280
most people see it as a kind of

2296
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:23,119
simplistic

2297
01:22:21,279 --> 01:22:25,599
doggedness where you just show up every

2298
01:22:23,119 --> 01:22:27,679
day that's not it

2299
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,880
the most important form of persistence

2300
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:32,000
is persistence of

2301
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:33,679
thinking which looks to push you in

2302
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,920
increasingly

2303
01:22:33,679 --> 01:22:38,000
efficient more and more efficient

2304
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:40,319
methods of training

2305
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:42,560
famously people talk about the idea that

2306
01:22:40,319 --> 01:22:45,039
the hardest work of all is hard thinking

2307
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:46,639
and they're absolutely right okay coming

2308
01:22:45,039 --> 01:22:47,359
into the gym and just doing the same

2309
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:49,279
thing

2310
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:51,679
for a decade isn't going to make you

2311
01:22:49,279 --> 01:22:53,840
better what's going to make you better

2312
01:22:51,679 --> 01:22:54,880
is progressive training over time where

2313
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,199
you identify

2314
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:59,039
clear goals marked out in time

2315
01:22:57,198 --> 01:23:01,519
increments three months six months 12

2316
01:22:59,039 --> 01:23:04,719
months five years

2317
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:06,990
and build those short-term goals into a

2318
01:23:04,719 --> 01:23:08,158
program of long-term goals

2319
01:23:06,989 --> 01:23:09,840
[Music]

2320
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:11,679
making sure that the training program

2321
01:23:09,840 --> 01:23:13,760
changes over time so that as your skill

2322
01:23:11,679 --> 01:23:15,760
level rises the challenges you face in

2323
01:23:13,760 --> 01:23:17,920
the gym become higher and higher

2324
01:23:15,760 --> 01:23:19,360
don't kill them at the start with

2325
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,440
challenges that are too hard for them to

2326
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:23,679
deal with they get discouraged and leave

2327
01:23:21,439 --> 01:23:25,759
build them slowly over time but make

2328
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:26,960
sure they don't just get left in a swamp

2329
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:28,239
where they're just doing the same thing

2330
01:23:26,960 --> 01:23:29,439
that we're doing three years ago and

2331
01:23:28,238 --> 01:23:32,158
they get bored and

2332
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:33,279
there's two ways you can leave in a gym

2333
01:23:32,158 --> 01:23:36,158
you can leave

2334
01:23:33,279 --> 01:23:38,079
from adversity it was too tough or you

2335
01:23:36,158 --> 01:23:41,119
can leave from boredom

2336
01:23:38,079 --> 01:23:43,359
everyone talks about the first no one

2337
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:45,920
talks about the second

2338
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:47,359
most people when they get to black belt

2339
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,800
they get bored

2340
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:49,920
they know what their game is they know

2341
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,119
what they're good at they know what

2342
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:52,800
they're not good at

2343
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:53,840
when they compete they stick with what

2344
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,960
they're good at and they avoid what

2345
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:57,119
they're not good at

2346
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:58,158
yeah and they get bored they reach a

2347
01:23:57,119 --> 01:24:01,039
plateau

2348
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:02,000
and that's it my whole thing is to make

2349
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:03,519
sure it's not so

2350
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:05,039
tough at the start that they leave

2351
01:24:03,520 --> 01:24:06,480
because of adversity

2352
01:24:05,039 --> 01:24:08,479
and then for the rest of their career to

2353
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:10,718
make sure it's not boring so they leave

2354
01:24:08,479 --> 01:24:12,238
because of boredom travis stevens

2355
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:14,239
actually said something that

2356
01:24:12,238 --> 01:24:16,000
changed the way i see training he said

2357
01:24:14,238 --> 01:24:18,000
it as a side comment but he said

2358
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,920
that at the end of a training at the end

2359
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:21,760
of a good training session

2360
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,158
your mind should be exhausted not your

2361
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,159
body

2362
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:30,238
and um i've for most of my life

2363
01:24:27,840 --> 01:24:31,279
saw good training sessions where my body

2364
01:24:30,238 --> 01:24:34,000
was exhausted

2365
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,639
yes i believe that's the case with most

2366
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,719
people

2367
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:38,000
yeah you should come out of the training

2368
01:24:36,719 --> 01:24:40,158
session with your mind

2369
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,439
buzzing with ideas like possibilities

2370
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:43,198
for tomorrow

2371
01:24:41,439 --> 01:24:44,479
and by the way on that note i would go

2372
01:24:43,198 --> 01:24:46,799
further and say that

2373
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:48,559
the training session doesn't finish when

2374
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:51,039
your body stops moving

2375
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:53,039
it finishes when your mind stops moving

2376
01:24:51,039 --> 01:24:54,399
and your mind shouldn't stop moving

2377
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:56,238
after that session there should be

2378
01:24:54,399 --> 01:24:57,198
analysis what did i do well what did i

2379
01:24:56,238 --> 01:24:58,718
do badly

2380
01:24:57,198 --> 01:25:00,879
how could i do better with the things

2381
01:24:58,719 --> 01:25:02,560
that i did well i can ask about

2382
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:05,119
something that

2383
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,960
i truly enjoy and i think is really

2384
01:25:05,119 --> 01:25:07,840
powerful but most people don't seem to

2385
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:11,520
believe in that but

2386
01:25:07,840 --> 01:25:13,920
it's drilling i don't know

2387
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:15,280
maybe people are different but i love

2388
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,199
the idea

2389
01:25:15,279 --> 01:25:19,359
maybe even outside of jiu jitsu of doing

2390
01:25:17,198 --> 01:25:23,279
the same thing over and over

2391
01:25:19,359 --> 01:25:26,479
it's like jiro dreams of sushi i love

2392
01:25:23,279 --> 01:25:29,198
doing the thing uh that

2393
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:31,198
nobody wants to do and doing it 10 times

2394
01:25:29,198 --> 01:25:34,559
100 times thousand times more than

2395
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:37,439
what nobody wants to do so

2396
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:39,120
i'm a huge fan of drilling obviously i'm

2397
01:25:37,439 --> 01:25:40,158
not a professional athlete but i feel

2398
01:25:39,119 --> 01:25:43,519
like if i actually

2399
01:25:40,158 --> 01:25:45,198
gave myself if i wanted to be really

2400
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,440
good at jiu jitsu like

2401
01:25:45,198 --> 01:25:48,799
reach the level of being in the top 25

2402
01:25:47,439 --> 01:25:51,919
when i was much younger

2403
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:51,920
like really strive

2404
01:25:52,479 --> 01:25:59,039
i think i could achieve it by drilling

2405
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:02,079
hmm that's i had this belief untested

2406
01:25:59,039 --> 01:26:05,279
can you challenge this idea or

2407
01:26:02,079 --> 01:26:08,000
or first off fascinating

2408
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:08,319
however we're going to have to disagree

2409
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:11,520
no

2410
01:26:08,319 --> 01:26:13,920
no okay um we're just going to have to

2411
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:15,760
start to understand what are we talking

2412
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:18,480
about when we talk about drilling it's a

2413
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:21,840
very vague term

2414
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:23,519
okay if you're at this moment many of

2415
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:25,279
your listeners are probably seen

2416
01:26:23,520 --> 01:26:27,760
having the same thought process which is

2417
01:26:25,279 --> 01:26:30,479
a drilling yeah i know what that is

2418
01:26:27,760 --> 01:26:32,000
we go into the gym and we pick a move

2419
01:26:30,479 --> 01:26:34,319
and we practice it for a certain number

2420
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:37,359
of repetitions

2421
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:39,039
and if i do that i'm gonna get better at

2422
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:42,319
the technique

2423
01:26:39,039 --> 01:26:42,319
okay um

2424
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:46,400
they're wrong

2425
01:26:47,039 --> 01:26:54,079
we've got to have a much more

2426
01:26:50,719 --> 01:26:55,520
in-depth understanding

2427
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:58,399
of what the hell we're talking about

2428
01:26:55,520 --> 01:27:02,320
when we talk about drilling

2429
01:26:58,399 --> 01:27:06,479
ultimately any movement

2430
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:08,880
in the gym that doesn't

2431
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:10,638
improve the skills you already have or

2432
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:14,400
build new skills

2433
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:16,560
is a waste of time a waste of resources

2434
01:27:14,399 --> 01:27:17,439
everything you do should be done with

2435
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,120
the aim

2436
01:27:17,439 --> 01:27:20,960
and the understanding that this is going

2437
01:27:19,119 --> 01:27:21,840
to make me better at the sport i

2438
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:25,439
practice

2439
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:25,440
if it's not it shouldn't be there

2440
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,880
the majority of what passes for drilling

2441
01:27:28,560 --> 01:27:32,560
in most training halls will not make you

2442
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:34,719
better

2443
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:37,199
including some of the most cherished

2444
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:40,960
forms of drilling

2445
01:27:37,198 --> 01:27:42,799
which is repetition for numbers

2446
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:45,279
the moment you say to someone i want you

2447
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:47,920
to do this a hundred times

2448
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:49,840
what are they really thinking about

2449
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:53,279
volume

2450
01:27:49,840 --> 01:27:56,159
they're saying okay i'm at repetition 78

2451
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:58,639
i'm at 80 20 more to go all they talk

2452
01:27:56,158 --> 01:28:02,000
their primary thought process

2453
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:03,119
is on numbers that's not the point of

2454
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:06,238
drilling

2455
01:28:03,119 --> 01:28:08,880
the point is skill acquisition

2456
01:28:06,238 --> 01:28:09,599
when people drill don't get them focused

2457
01:28:08,880 --> 01:28:12,719
on numbers

2458
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,159
get them focused on mechanics that's

2459
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:16,639
what they have to worry about

2460
01:28:14,158 --> 01:28:17,679
i never have my students drill for for

2461
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:20,079
numbers ever

2462
01:28:17,679 --> 01:28:20,880
just one two three get the [ __ ] out of

2463
01:28:20,079 --> 01:28:22,158
here

2464
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:24,239
are you kidding me like how are you

2465
01:28:22,158 --> 01:28:26,960
gonna get better with that okay

2466
01:28:24,238 --> 01:28:28,158
get them working on the sense of gaining

2467
01:28:26,960 --> 01:28:31,039
knowledge

2468
01:28:28,158 --> 01:28:33,119
that's my job i have to give them

2469
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:34,880
knowledge i have to explain to them

2470
01:28:33,119 --> 01:28:36,719
what they're trying to do that starts

2471
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:39,840
them on the right track

2472
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:42,560
but knowledge is one thing skill

2473
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:44,000
is another if jiu jitsu was just about

2474
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,360
knowledge

2475
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:49,119
then all the 60 and 70 year old

2476
01:28:47,359 --> 01:28:50,960
red belts would be the world champions

2477
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:53,920
they're not

2478
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:55,359
isn't one by knowledge it's one by skill

2479
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:59,119
knowledge is the first

2480
01:28:55,359 --> 01:29:00,479
step in building skill so my job as a

2481
01:28:59,119 --> 01:29:03,359
coach is to transmit

2482
01:29:00,479 --> 01:29:04,638
knowledge then i have to create training

2483
01:29:03,359 --> 01:29:07,759
programs

2484
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:11,199
with a path from knowledge to polished

2485
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:13,039
skill is carried out

2486
01:29:11,198 --> 01:29:15,039
that's the interface between me and my

2487
01:29:13,039 --> 01:29:18,719
students and so i give them

2488
01:29:15,039 --> 01:29:22,719
drills where the whole emphasis

2489
01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:24,880
is upon getting a sense where they

2490
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,480
understand what are the problems they're

2491
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:30,480
trying to solve

2492
01:29:26,479 --> 01:29:33,198
and working towards practical solutions

2493
01:29:30,479 --> 01:29:33,759
they never work with numbers they work

2494
01:29:33,198 --> 01:29:36,960
with

2495
01:29:33,760 --> 01:29:38,239
mechanics and feel then

2496
01:29:36,960 --> 01:29:40,960
you have to bring in the idea of

2497
01:29:38,238 --> 01:29:40,959
progression

2498
01:29:41,439 --> 01:29:46,719
when you drill there's zero resistance

2499
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:48,880
when you fight in competition there's a

2500
01:29:46,719 --> 01:29:52,560
hundred percent resistance

2501
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:55,920
you can't go from zero to a hundred

2502
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:59,199
there has to be progress over time

2503
01:29:55,920 --> 01:30:02,639
where i have them work in drills

2504
01:29:59,198 --> 01:30:05,039
with slightly increasing increments

2505
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:06,719
of resistance and just as we talked

2506
01:30:05,039 --> 01:30:08,719
about earlier with the weightlifter who

2507
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:11,198
doesn't start with 500 pounds

2508
01:30:08,719 --> 01:30:13,760
but who begins with the bar and then

2509
01:30:11,198 --> 01:30:15,839
over time builds the skills that one day

2510
01:30:13,760 --> 01:30:16,719
out there in the future he will lift 500

2511
01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:19,039
pounds

2512
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,920
so too that judy gatami that you're

2513
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:22,319
working on today

2514
01:30:19,920 --> 01:30:23,920
is feeble and pathetic but five years

2515
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:25,599
from now you'll win a world championship

2516
01:30:23,920 --> 01:30:27,920
with it

2517
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:29,520
you can't have this naive idea of

2518
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:30,319
drilling it's something you just come

2519
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:33,679
out

2520
01:30:30,319 --> 01:30:35,759
you randomly pick a move and you

2521
01:30:33,679 --> 01:30:37,119
work for numbers until you satisfy a

2522
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,400
certain set of numbers that your coach

2523
01:30:37,119 --> 01:30:39,599
threw at you and then think you're going

2524
01:30:38,399 --> 01:30:43,359
to get better

2525
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,360
there's even dangers with drilling

2526
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:52,639
there is no performance

2527
01:30:49,198 --> 01:30:54,719
increase that comes

2528
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:58,480
once you get to a certain level and you

2529
01:30:54,719 --> 01:31:01,600
just keep doing the same damn thing

2530
01:30:58,479 --> 01:31:04,559
let's say for example you come out

2531
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:06,639
and you hit a hundred repetitions of the

2532
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,920
arm by judy tommy from guard position

2533
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:09,600
and you're all proud of yourself because

2534
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:10,960
you hit 100 repetitions and your body's

2535
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:13,440
tired and you're telling yourself

2536
01:31:10,960 --> 01:31:14,079
man i got a good workout and you come in

2537
01:31:13,439 --> 01:31:16,559
tomorrow

2538
01:31:14,079 --> 01:31:18,238
you do exactly the same thing you come

2539
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:20,800
in the day after that and a week goes by

2540
01:31:18,238 --> 01:31:24,479
and you've done the same thing

2541
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:27,920
then a year later you do the same thing

2542
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:30,000
ask yourself has your judy katami really

2543
01:31:27,920 --> 01:31:32,399
gotten better

2544
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:35,920
no you've performed literally thousands

2545
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:35,920
and thousands of repetitions

2546
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:41,520
you have spent an enormous amount of

2547
01:31:39,679 --> 01:31:42,960
training time and energy that could have

2548
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:44,960
gone in different directions

2549
01:31:42,960 --> 01:31:47,359
on something which didn't make you any

2550
01:31:44,960 --> 01:31:47,359
better

2551
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:54,079
drills have diminishing returns

2552
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,880
once you get to a certain skill level if

2553
01:31:54,079 --> 01:31:57,760
you just keep

2554
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:58,880
hammering on the same thing in the same

2555
01:31:57,760 --> 01:32:02,000
fashion

2556
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:04,719
for the same amount of time you stop

2557
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:06,079
getting better can i partially for fun

2558
01:32:04,719 --> 01:32:07,279
partially for dallas advocate but

2559
01:32:06,079 --> 01:32:10,479
partially because i actually believe

2560
01:32:07,279 --> 01:32:13,519
this to push back on some points

2561
01:32:10,479 --> 01:32:14,079
is it possible so everything you said i

2562
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:17,920
think is

2563
01:32:14,079 --> 01:32:17,920
beautiful and correct but

2564
01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:21,279
the asking yourself the question am i

2565
01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,279
getting better is a really important one

2566
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:26,399
and you could do that in training

2567
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:28,158
is there a set of techniques maybe a

2568
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:29,679
small subset of all the techniques that

2569
01:32:28,158 --> 01:32:33,198
are in jiu jitsu

2570
01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:36,639
where you can have significant

2571
01:32:33,198 --> 01:32:37,279
skill acquisition if you put in the

2572
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:39,920
numbers

2573
01:32:37,279 --> 01:32:43,119
or the time whatever on a technique

2574
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:46,239
against an opponent who's not resisting

2575
01:32:43,119 --> 01:32:47,519
here's let me elaborate what i've in my

2576
01:32:46,238 --> 01:32:50,959
maybe i'm different you'll probably have

2577
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:50,960
to finish an example yes

2578
01:32:51,198 --> 01:32:54,479
let me first make a general statement

2579
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:56,719
and i can give examples

2580
01:32:54,479 --> 01:32:57,919
the general statement is i found that

2581
01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:01,198
through repetitions

2582
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,880
and this is high repetitions combined

2583
01:33:01,198 --> 01:33:05,039
with training but high repetitions

2584
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:08,560
against a non-resisting opponent

2585
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:10,399
i've gotten to understand the way my

2586
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:12,639
body moves

2587
01:33:10,399 --> 01:33:13,839
the way i apply pressure on a human

2588
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:15,520
because it's not actually zero

2589
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:16,000
resistance the opponent's still laying

2590
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:17,920
there

2591
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,439
they're still keeping their legs up

2592
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,880
they're still doing

2593
01:33:19,439 --> 01:33:22,479
they might not be resisting but they're

2594
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:26,079
still creating a structure

2595
01:33:22,479 --> 01:33:29,279
yes they're presenting a target

2596
01:33:26,079 --> 01:33:32,319
yes it's not dynamic so you can't

2597
01:33:29,279 --> 01:33:33,519
master the timing of things but you can

2598
01:33:32,319 --> 01:33:36,158
master

2599
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,880
the not master but i felt like i could

2600
01:33:36,158 --> 01:33:38,479
gain

2601
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:40,880
an understanding of how to apply

2602
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:43,439
pressure to the human body

2603
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:44,079
over thousands of repetitions now for

2604
01:33:43,439 --> 01:33:45,678
example i

2605
01:33:44,079 --> 01:33:47,439
just just to give you an example to to

2606
01:33:45,679 --> 01:33:49,920
know what we're talking about

2607
01:33:47,439 --> 01:33:50,719
uh there's a guy named uh like sal

2608
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,600
hibero and

2609
01:33:50,719 --> 01:33:54,079
sean jihabero that have this i guess the

2610
01:33:53,600 --> 01:33:56,239
uh

2611
01:33:54,079 --> 01:33:57,519
i already forgot but the headquarters

2612
01:33:56,238 --> 01:34:00,559
position or something like that

2613
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:02,840
but putting pressure as you pass guard

2614
01:34:00,560 --> 01:34:04,400
uh like medium passing distance kind of

2615
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:06,719
pressure

2616
01:34:04,399 --> 01:34:08,158
i've did thousands of repetitions of

2617
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:11,119
that to understand

2618
01:34:08,158 --> 01:34:12,238
what what putting pressure with my hips

2619
01:34:11,119 --> 01:34:14,319
feels like

2620
01:34:12,238 --> 01:34:15,839
to truly understand that movement i felt

2621
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:18,559
like i was getting

2622
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:20,079
much better it's it's like it's hard to

2623
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:21,520
put into words but that skill

2624
01:34:20,079 --> 01:34:23,920
acquisition is

2625
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:25,360
it's so subtle just the way you turn

2626
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,279
your little like hips

2627
01:34:25,359 --> 01:34:28,719
but you're already talking about a

2628
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:30,399
better form of drawing now

2629
01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:31,840
you're going beyond the basic numbers

2630
01:34:30,399 --> 01:34:33,359
and you're getting the sense of feel and

2631
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,920
mechanics which is what we want in

2632
01:34:33,359 --> 01:34:36,559
drilling

2633
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:38,319
but the reason i say numbers and maybe

2634
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:41,520
you can speak to this but the

2635
01:34:38,319 --> 01:34:43,279
this might be an ocd thing but it it

2636
01:34:41,520 --> 01:34:45,040
allows you to take a journey

2637
01:34:43,279 --> 01:34:46,319
that doesn't just last a week or two

2638
01:34:45,039 --> 01:34:48,158
weeks

2639
01:34:46,319 --> 01:34:49,599
but a journey where you stay with the

2640
01:34:48,158 --> 01:34:53,039
technique for two

2641
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,760
three years and there's a dedication to

2642
01:34:53,039 --> 01:34:56,960
it

2643
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:59,199
where it's a long-term commitment

2644
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,800
to where you're forcing yourself perhaps

2645
01:34:59,198 --> 01:35:02,719
there's other mechanisms but

2646
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:04,719
you're forcing yourself to stay with a

2647
01:35:02,719 --> 01:35:06,239
technique longer than most people around

2648
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:07,039
you are staying with whatever they're

2649
01:35:06,238 --> 01:35:09,198
working on

2650
01:35:07,039 --> 01:35:10,399
and you're taking that long journey and

2651
01:35:09,198 --> 01:35:12,839
the numbers somehow

2652
01:35:10,399 --> 01:35:15,039
enforce that persistence and that

2653
01:35:12,840 --> 01:35:18,000
dedication um

2654
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:19,279
first thing that journey is a wonderful

2655
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,880
thing and if that technique

2656
01:35:19,279 --> 01:35:25,039
is a a crucial part of what you do

2657
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:26,000
then it's time well invested but always

2658
01:35:25,039 --> 01:35:27,439
understand that it comes at an

2659
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:29,600
opportunity cost

2660
01:35:27,439 --> 01:35:31,118
that by spending that amount of time on

2661
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:32,719
that one technique you've sacrificed

2662
01:35:31,118 --> 01:35:34,960
other things that you could have

2663
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:38,079
learned that could have won your matches

2664
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:40,239
so understand that every

2665
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:41,679
focus upon one element of the game comes

2666
01:35:40,238 --> 01:35:42,638
at the opportunity cost of other

2667
01:35:41,679 --> 01:35:46,000
elements

2668
01:35:42,639 --> 01:35:46,800
um now as long as you're playing a part

2669
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,960
of the game where

2670
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:50,719
okay this is central to what i do yes

2671
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:52,719
okay that's fine

2672
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:54,239
but um just be aware of the danger of

2673
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:55,760
opportunity cost that's something no one

2674
01:35:54,238 --> 01:35:58,000
talks about in the training room but

2675
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,280
it becomes very important secondly the

2676
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,560
other question you have to start asking

2677
01:35:59,279 --> 01:36:03,840
yourself is

2678
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,320
okay that training clearly had benefits

2679
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:07,039
for you

2680
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:08,799
early on but when the point of

2681
01:36:07,039 --> 01:36:10,000
diminishing returns starts coming and if

2682
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,239
you feel you're just doing

2683
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:13,920
the same thing then it's time to switch

2684
01:36:12,238 --> 01:36:15,279
now if you feel you're still getting

2685
01:36:13,920 --> 01:36:17,920
benefit from it

2686
01:36:15,279 --> 01:36:19,920
by all means continue that will be a

2687
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:21,039
call on your part you're

2688
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:22,880
you've been playing this game a long

2689
01:36:21,039 --> 01:36:25,359
time now so i would trust your call on

2690
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:27,679
that

2691
01:36:25,359 --> 01:36:28,479
but my job as a coach is to look out and

2692
01:36:27,679 --> 01:36:31,279
say

2693
01:36:28,479 --> 01:36:32,638
okay this kid's been working across

2694
01:36:31,279 --> 01:36:35,840
hashigorami

2695
01:36:32,639 --> 01:36:37,199
for six months and i feel he's gotten to

2696
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:40,159
a good skill level

2697
01:36:37,198 --> 01:36:40,960
if he stays any further on it the

2698
01:36:40,158 --> 01:36:44,079
opportunity

2699
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:45,679
cost becomes greater than the expected

2700
01:36:44,079 --> 01:36:47,198
benefits of continuing it

2701
01:36:45,679 --> 01:36:48,800
and that's my job as a coach is to

2702
01:36:47,198 --> 01:36:50,079
direct things in that fashion if i can

2703
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:51,679
do a good job with that

2704
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:53,279
then i can take them to the next level

2705
01:36:51,679 --> 01:36:55,199
of drilling and

2706
01:36:53,279 --> 01:36:56,639
start amping it up and that's how i keep

2707
01:36:55,198 --> 01:37:00,960
progress over time

2708
01:36:56,639 --> 01:37:02,800
my biggest fear is to have students

2709
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,079
run past the point of diminishing

2710
01:37:02,800 --> 01:37:07,840
returns staying

2711
01:37:04,079 --> 01:37:10,238
stagnant where opportunity cost comes in

2712
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,520
and they're not making the progress they

2713
01:37:10,238 --> 01:37:13,039
could in the time that they've been

2714
01:37:11,520 --> 01:37:14,480
working

2715
01:37:13,039 --> 01:37:16,238
i mean that was it was almost a

2716
01:37:14,479 --> 01:37:17,919
philosophical question for me

2717
01:37:16,238 --> 01:37:20,399
that's what i was always in a search on

2718
01:37:17,920 --> 01:37:23,039
because i know my mind

2719
01:37:20,399 --> 01:37:24,638
is uh likes drilling i don't like

2720
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:28,800
relying on other people

2721
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:32,400
for improvement and drilling

2722
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:34,320
allows me to do something that that

2723
01:37:32,399 --> 01:37:35,439
that is percent most interesting legs

2724
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:37,359
but you say you don't like relying on

2725
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:39,198
other people on drilling but in drilling

2726
01:37:37,359 --> 01:37:40,319
you really do rely a lot on your partner

2727
01:37:39,198 --> 01:37:41,599
one of the first things i do when i

2728
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:42,719
coach people is i teach them how to

2729
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:46,880
drill

2730
01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:50,560
like that's a skill in itself and um

2731
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:54,639
drilling is in a sense the opposite

2732
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:55,600
of sparring drilling is a cooperative

2733
01:37:54,639 --> 01:37:58,319
venture

2734
01:37:55,600 --> 01:38:01,119
where you work as dance partners

2735
01:37:58,319 --> 01:38:03,198
complementing each other's movement

2736
01:38:01,118 --> 01:38:05,279
if i drill with gordon ryan and i want

2737
01:38:03,198 --> 01:38:06,559
him to work armbars i will move my body

2738
01:38:05,279 --> 01:38:08,880
in ways which

2739
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:10,320
make it an interesting exercise for

2740
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:14,319
gordon

2741
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:16,479
um i'm not just sitting there and he

2742
01:38:14,319 --> 01:38:19,279
does a repetition and i'm

2743
01:38:16,479 --> 01:38:20,799
okay he does 10. um i can't wait for

2744
01:38:19,279 --> 01:38:22,238
this to be over so i can do my ten

2745
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,840
and i can't wait for all the spares so

2746
01:38:22,238 --> 01:38:24,879
we can just spar and get over with all

2747
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:27,520
this [ __ ]

2748
01:38:24,880 --> 01:38:28,840
um that's the sad truth of most drilling

2749
01:38:27,520 --> 01:38:32,239
and jujitsu

2750
01:38:28,840 --> 01:38:33,199
um there's a sense in which when good

2751
01:38:32,238 --> 01:38:36,879
people drill

2752
01:38:33,198 --> 01:38:39,039
it's like watching good people dance

2753
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:40,239
they move in unison and complement each

2754
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:42,079
other's movement and make each other

2755
01:38:40,238 --> 01:38:43,759
look better

2756
01:38:42,079 --> 01:38:45,519
sparring on the other hand is the exact

2757
01:38:43,760 --> 01:38:46,560
opposite of that that's resistance where

2758
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,239
you're trying to make the other person

2759
01:38:46,560 --> 01:38:50,400
look as bad as possible

2760
01:38:48,238 --> 01:38:51,678
and once you understand the different

2761
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:52,559
directions in which drilling and

2762
01:38:51,679 --> 01:38:53,760
sparring go

2763
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:55,119
that's when things start getting

2764
01:38:53,760 --> 01:38:56,400
interesting you start getting fast

2765
01:38:55,118 --> 01:38:59,279
progress

2766
01:38:56,399 --> 01:38:59,920
yeah just uh you're absolutely right i i

2767
01:38:59,279 --> 01:39:02,079
think i was

2768
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:05,118
not very eloquent describing what i mean

2769
01:39:02,079 --> 01:39:05,118
i found myself

2770
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:08,800
not able to find and jiu-jitsu too many

2771
01:39:07,600 --> 01:39:11,840
people that are willing

2772
01:39:08,800 --> 01:39:12,960
to dedicate a huge amount of time to a

2773
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,440
particular technique

2774
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:16,480
i concur with you on netflix now answer

2775
01:39:15,439 --> 01:39:20,000
the interesting question

2776
01:39:16,479 --> 01:39:21,759
why why can't you get people to drill

2777
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:24,238
with you

2778
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:25,600
by the way if i could just shout out the

2779
01:39:24,238 --> 01:39:28,799
people that did draw with me

2780
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:31,360
is usually blue belt women

2781
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,039
because they're smaller they don't like

2782
01:39:31,359 --> 01:39:34,399
training

2783
01:39:33,039 --> 01:39:36,079
because they get their ass kicked

2784
01:39:34,399 --> 01:39:39,439
because they're much smaller

2785
01:39:36,079 --> 01:39:43,198
so they're willing to improve it invest

2786
01:39:39,439 --> 01:39:46,158
significant amount of effort into uh um

2787
01:39:43,198 --> 01:39:48,000
into training that's that's good but

2788
01:39:46,158 --> 01:39:51,039
their motivation for doing so is not

2789
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,920
good well yes but your motivation for

2790
01:39:51,039 --> 01:39:52,719
drilling is because you don't want to

2791
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:56,000
get your ass kicked

2792
01:39:52,719 --> 01:39:57,840
no good black belt ever i could never

2793
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:58,399
find a black belt that i could draw with

2794
01:39:57,840 --> 01:40:00,319
like this

2795
01:39:58,399 --> 01:40:01,439
this the uh now let's go back to that

2796
01:40:00,319 --> 01:40:04,719
question why

2797
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:06,238
i don't i mean this i i am

2798
01:40:04,719 --> 01:40:08,639
somebody who likes to say nice things

2799
01:40:06,238 --> 01:40:09,759
about people so let me let me answer for

2800
01:40:08,639 --> 01:40:12,480
you yeah

2801
01:40:09,760 --> 01:40:13,760
two reasons because they find it boring

2802
01:40:12,479 --> 01:40:15,039
yes and secondly

2803
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,880
perhaps more importantly they don't

2804
01:40:15,039 --> 01:40:19,679
believe it works yeah

2805
01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:21,279
those are good answers and now let's go

2806
01:40:19,679 --> 01:40:22,639
further and ask the truly interesting

2807
01:40:21,279 --> 01:40:25,679
question

2808
01:40:22,639 --> 01:40:28,800
why do they believe that

2809
01:40:25,679 --> 01:40:30,880
if i were to answer it in the context of

2810
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:34,079
russian wrestling where drilling is much

2811
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:36,560
bigger part is i think culturally

2812
01:40:34,079 --> 01:40:37,439
that was knowledge that everybody tells

2813
01:40:36,560 --> 01:40:42,639
each other

2814
01:40:37,439 --> 01:40:45,919
in jiu jitsu that uh drilling

2815
01:40:42,639 --> 01:40:47,359
doesn't work because they're never

2816
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,719
taught how to drill

2817
01:40:47,359 --> 01:40:50,719
no one ever sits you down one day and

2818
01:40:48,719 --> 01:40:54,239
says okay this is how you drill

2819
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:55,760
and so the exercise feels futile they

2820
01:40:54,238 --> 01:40:57,599
don't feel the skill level is going up

2821
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,679
they don't associate drilling with

2822
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:01,039
increased skill level they associate

2823
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,960
sparring with increased

2824
01:41:01,039 --> 01:41:05,198
skill level but not drilling which is a

2825
01:41:02,960 --> 01:41:08,079
tragedy because

2826
01:41:05,198 --> 01:41:09,678
it is a fantastic way to introduce and

2827
01:41:08,079 --> 01:41:11,600
expand the repertoire

2828
01:41:09,679 --> 01:41:14,800
of a developing student it's an

2829
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:17,119
essential part of every workout i teach

2830
01:41:14,800 --> 01:41:18,800
i always say that game of judity begins

2831
01:41:17,118 --> 01:41:21,279
with knowledge and

2832
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:23,039
builds up to skill who wins is the one

2833
01:41:21,279 --> 01:41:26,158
who has greater skill

2834
01:41:23,039 --> 01:41:28,639
and nine times out of ten um so

2835
01:41:26,158 --> 01:41:30,238
to me it's a tragedy that what you're

2836
01:41:28,639 --> 01:41:31,679
saying breaks my heart to hear that you

2837
01:41:30,238 --> 01:41:32,238
couldn't get a black belt to drill with

2838
01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:35,359
you that's

2839
01:41:32,238 --> 01:41:38,079
that's shameful and i but i understand i

2840
01:41:35,359 --> 01:41:38,960
i i sympathize with those black belts

2841
01:41:38,079 --> 01:41:40,800
too because

2842
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:42,319
the way in which most people are told to

2843
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:45,119
drill does feel

2844
01:41:42,319 --> 01:41:46,238
ineffective and it is damn boring they'd

2845
01:41:45,118 --> 01:41:47,519
rather just spar

2846
01:41:46,238 --> 01:41:49,759
they feel like they get more out of the

2847
01:41:47,520 --> 01:41:52,000
workout and that's

2848
01:41:49,760 --> 01:41:53,520
that's if anything an indictment upon

2849
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,560
most of the training programs around the

2850
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:57,199
nation

2851
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:58,800
would you say that drilling if you were

2852
01:41:57,198 --> 01:42:01,678
to build

2853
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:03,199
a black belt world champion would

2854
01:42:01,679 --> 01:42:06,000
drilling be

2855
01:42:03,198 --> 01:42:07,439
what percent of their training in the

2856
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,920
entirety of their career would be

2857
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:11,039
drilling

2858
01:42:07,920 --> 01:42:12,239
good great question um let's first put a

2859
01:42:11,039 --> 01:42:14,079
proviso on it that i

2860
01:42:12,238 --> 01:42:16,158
don't do the same thing for all athletes

2861
01:42:14,079 --> 01:42:19,039
everyone's got a different personality

2862
01:42:16,158 --> 01:42:20,879
and like nikki rod i can only hold his

2863
01:42:19,039 --> 01:42:24,319
attention for two minutes at a time

2864
01:42:20,880 --> 01:42:27,520
and uh gary tonen

2865
01:42:24,319 --> 01:42:30,799
um five minutes uh gordon ryan

2866
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:31,600
five hours like uh george saint pierre

2867
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:34,639
five hours

2868
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:36,239
travis stevens five hours they are just

2869
01:42:34,639 --> 01:42:38,960
laser focused so everyone's different

2870
01:42:36,238 --> 01:42:41,759
let's put that down as our first proviso

2871
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:42,158
um uh you probably knew those answers

2872
01:42:41,760 --> 01:42:45,760
already

2873
01:42:42,158 --> 01:42:48,799
yeah um that's hilarious but

2874
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:52,400
uh as a general rule

2875
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:55,279
uh if i run a two and a half hour class

2876
01:42:52,399 --> 01:42:57,519
uh you can expect an hour and a half of

2877
01:42:55,279 --> 01:42:59,198
it to be

2878
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:00,560
i'm going to use the word drilling but

2879
01:42:59,198 --> 01:43:03,118
i'm also going to say that

2880
01:43:00,560 --> 01:43:04,239
this is too complex of a story to give

2881
01:43:03,118 --> 01:43:05,198
now with words i would need to

2882
01:43:04,238 --> 01:43:06,799
demonstrate it

2883
01:43:05,198 --> 01:43:08,479
but the way in which we drill is not

2884
01:43:06,800 --> 01:43:11,600
your standard method of drilling

2885
01:43:08,479 --> 01:43:13,279
and then it's into sparring

2886
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:16,159
but if you give me a choice between a

2887
01:43:13,279 --> 01:43:18,559
bad drilling partner and sparring

2888
01:43:16,158 --> 01:43:20,000
i could make the same choice that most

2889
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,039
black belts make without go with

2890
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:24,960
sparring

2891
01:43:21,039 --> 01:43:24,960
because you can create drilling with it

2892
01:43:26,399 --> 01:43:29,920
like good drilling is a wonderful thing

2893
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:32,319
bad drilling is just a worthless waste

2894
01:43:29,920 --> 01:43:32,319
of time

2895
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:37,119
okay before i have a million questions

2896
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,440
for you but i have to ask

2897
01:43:37,118 --> 01:43:40,960
can you we've described the fundamentals

2898
01:43:39,439 --> 01:43:43,198
of jiu jitsu

2899
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,399
can we describe the principles the

2900
01:43:43,198 --> 01:43:46,158
fundamentals

2901
01:43:44,399 --> 01:43:49,198
of one of the interesting systems you've

2902
01:43:46,158 --> 01:43:51,679
developed which is the leglock system

2903
01:43:49,198 --> 01:43:52,719
yeah anything in particular or just like

2904
01:43:51,679 --> 01:43:54,560
a general

2905
01:43:52,719 --> 01:43:55,760
understand what are some of the major

2906
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:58,480
principles of it

2907
01:43:55,760 --> 01:44:00,480
well it's like me coming to uh miyamoto

2908
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:03,839
musashi and asking can you describe

2909
01:44:00,479 --> 01:44:06,959
the principles of sword fighting

2910
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:10,400
you're too generous um let's

2911
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:13,760
start off with some context um when i

2912
01:44:10,399 --> 01:44:16,079
began the sport of jiu-jitsu i was

2913
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:20,079
taught

2914
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:23,039
a fairly classical approach to uh

2915
01:44:20,079 --> 01:44:25,760
jiu-jitsu which leglocks were a part of

2916
01:44:23,039 --> 01:44:28,719
it but not an emphasized part of it

2917
01:44:25,760 --> 01:44:30,079
um the overall culture of the times is

2918
01:44:28,719 --> 01:44:33,279
the mid-1990s

2919
01:44:30,079 --> 01:44:34,079
the overall culture of the time saw leg

2920
01:44:33,279 --> 01:44:37,439
locks

2921
01:44:34,079 --> 01:44:37,439
as uh

2922
01:44:39,359 --> 01:44:44,158
largely ineffective it was

2923
01:44:42,399 --> 01:44:45,679
we were told that against good

2924
01:44:44,158 --> 01:44:48,000
opposition they just didn't work very

2925
01:44:45,679 --> 01:44:50,480
well they were low percentage techniques

2926
01:44:48,000 --> 01:44:51,198
we were also told that they were

2927
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:54,158
tactically

2928
01:44:51,198 --> 01:44:54,879
unsound because if you ever attempted

2929
01:44:54,158 --> 01:44:58,079
them and you

2930
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:59,600
lost control of the leg lock

2931
01:44:58,079 --> 01:45:01,359
your opponent would end up on top of you

2932
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:02,400
or in some kind of good position and

2933
01:45:01,359 --> 01:45:05,279
you'd be in

2934
01:45:02,399 --> 01:45:06,638
terrible trouble um and we're also told

2935
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:09,439
that they were unsafe

2936
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:11,039
that uh if they were applied in the gym

2937
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:14,158
there'd be far too many injuries and

2938
01:45:11,039 --> 01:45:16,000
people would be badly hurt and

2939
01:45:14,158 --> 01:45:17,439
that was the received wisdom of that

2940
01:45:16,000 --> 01:45:20,399
time and so i

2941
01:45:17,439 --> 01:45:21,118
i didn't even would work with them at

2942
01:45:20,399 --> 01:45:23,279
all

2943
01:45:21,118 --> 01:45:24,319
and uh they would be shown occasionally

2944
01:45:23,279 --> 01:45:28,000
in the gym

2945
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:31,519
and you'd learn them you drilled them

2946
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:35,198
and but inspiring i showed no interest

2947
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:35,600
um you probably know that change when i

2948
01:45:35,198 --> 01:45:37,599
met

2949
01:45:35,600 --> 01:45:38,639
the the great american grandpa dean

2950
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:40,239
lester who

2951
01:45:38,639 --> 01:45:41,920
uh early in his career was using

2952
01:45:40,238 --> 01:45:43,519
achilles logs with

2953
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:45,279
considerable success i met him in the

2954
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:47,360
gym wonderful fellow

2955
01:45:45,279 --> 01:45:49,759
and um i give these locks as like a

2956
01:45:47,359 --> 01:45:53,039
straightforward yes that's correct yes

2957
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:55,840
and um uh he went on to become a

2958
01:45:53,039 --> 01:45:57,920
heel hooker and win 280 cc's later on in

2959
01:45:55,840 --> 01:45:59,199
his career but we never met again after

2960
01:45:57,920 --> 01:46:02,719
after that

2961
01:45:59,198 --> 01:46:06,000
and uh that

2962
01:46:02,719 --> 01:46:08,639
opened some doors of inquiry and

2963
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:10,560
uh well he asked this first principles

2964
01:46:08,639 --> 01:46:12,560
question is why would you only use half

2965
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:14,719
the body

2966
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:15,840
in a game which makes a human body

2967
01:46:14,719 --> 01:46:19,198
perfect sense

2968
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:20,880
so that opened doors to to inquiry and

2969
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:22,638
if you looked around the judiciary world

2970
01:46:20,880 --> 01:46:25,679
at that time um

2971
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:29,199
the number of specialized leg lockers

2972
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:32,880
was very small and most of them

2973
01:46:29,198 --> 01:46:35,118
were from outside of conventional

2974
01:46:32,880 --> 01:46:36,319
jiu-jitsu for example you could look

2975
01:46:35,118 --> 01:46:39,839
around and see people like

2976
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:41,840
romina sato had sharp leg locks for that

2977
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:45,119
time period in the 1990s

2978
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:46,719
um so they were out there they existed

2979
01:46:45,118 --> 01:46:48,719
and uh you'd see people like ken

2980
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:50,800
shamrock would would use uh

2981
01:46:48,719 --> 01:46:55,039
here hawks in competition and he had

2982
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:56,880
some some good success with them

2983
01:46:55,039 --> 01:46:59,198
when i began experimenting with the in

2984
01:46:56,880 --> 01:47:02,159
the gym

2985
01:46:59,198 --> 01:47:02,719
fairly soon certain truths started to

2986
01:47:02,158 --> 01:47:06,079
become

2987
01:47:02,719 --> 01:47:08,000
evident and

2988
01:47:06,079 --> 01:47:09,920
the most important of these can be

2989
01:47:08,000 --> 01:47:13,039
understood very quickly and they were

2990
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:17,440
relatively easy to discover

2991
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:20,880
the first was that most people

2992
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:20,879
when they went to

2993
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:26,000
understand and study leg locking

2994
01:47:24,399 --> 01:47:27,519
and when i talk about leg locking i'm

2995
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:29,679
going to talk about one specific type

2996
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:31,760
which is the most high percentage type

2997
01:47:29,679 --> 01:47:33,840
this is leg locks which are performed

2998
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:35,360
with entanglements of your opponent's

2999
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:36,000
legs with your legs there are other

3000
01:47:35,359 --> 01:47:37,279
forms of leg

3001
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:39,198
log but these are relatively low

3002
01:47:37,279 --> 01:47:40,319
percentage and don't figure heavily in

3003
01:47:39,198 --> 01:47:43,118
competition so i'll

3004
01:47:40,319 --> 01:47:43,118
i'll ignore them

3005
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:48,639
most people made no distinction between

3006
01:47:46,238 --> 01:47:51,678
the mechanism of control

3007
01:47:48,639 --> 01:47:55,199
versus the mechanism of breaking

3008
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:57,359
the heel hook is what ultimately

3009
01:47:55,198 --> 01:47:59,359
breaks the the angle but the mechanism

3010
01:47:57,359 --> 01:48:00,000
of control is the entanglement of your

3011
01:47:59,359 --> 01:48:02,719
legs

3012
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:04,560
to your opponent's legs the japanese

3013
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:04,880
term ashigorami literally just means

3014
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:06,880
like

3015
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:08,800
leg entanglement it's a generic term it

3016
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,520
could apply to any form of entanglement

3017
01:48:08,800 --> 01:48:13,600
there are many

3018
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:16,560
options my idea

3019
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,520
was let's focus on the entanglement

3020
01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:20,159
first

3021
01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,280
and worry about the breaking mechanism

3022
01:48:20,158 --> 01:48:23,118
second

3023
01:48:21,279 --> 01:48:24,880
this was analogous to the idea of

3024
01:48:23,118 --> 01:48:26,960
position before submission

3025
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:29,279
only you couldn't talk about it in terms

3026
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:31,520
of conventional positions because

3027
01:48:29,279 --> 01:48:33,198
ashigorami doesn't really fit into the

3028
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:36,080
traditional hierarchies

3029
01:48:33,198 --> 01:48:36,479
positional hierarchies of jiu-jitsu so

3030
01:48:36,079 --> 01:48:38,479
the

3031
01:48:36,479 --> 01:48:40,799
the the conversation was switched from

3032
01:48:38,479 --> 01:48:44,079
position to submission to control

3033
01:48:40,800 --> 01:48:46,239
to submission now

3034
01:48:44,079 --> 01:48:47,679
wrapping two of your legs around one of

3035
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:49,039
your opponent's legs gives you many

3036
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:50,399
different options you can do it with

3037
01:48:49,039 --> 01:48:52,399
your feet on the outside

3038
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:54,319
so-called 50-50 variations you can do

3039
01:48:52,399 --> 01:48:58,079
with your feet on the inside and

3040
01:48:54,319 --> 01:49:01,359
um form what we call inside

3041
01:48:58,079 --> 01:49:02,559
foot position um there's pros and cons

3042
01:49:01,359 --> 01:49:04,719
to both there's also

3043
01:49:02,560 --> 01:49:06,239
methods of harmonizing the two so you

3044
01:49:04,719 --> 01:49:07,279
have one foot on the inside and one foot

3045
01:49:06,238 --> 01:49:10,718
on the outside

3046
01:49:07,279 --> 01:49:13,039
you can do it with a straight uh

3047
01:49:10,719 --> 01:49:14,319
leg where you heel hook from the outside

3048
01:49:13,039 --> 01:49:15,118
or you can bring the leg across your

3049
01:49:14,319 --> 01:49:17,920
center line and

3050
01:49:15,118 --> 01:49:18,960
he'll hook from the inside you will

3051
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:20,719
start to

3052
01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:22,239
notice as you work through these

3053
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:25,840
different variations that

3054
01:49:22,238 --> 01:49:29,279
some present advantages over others

3055
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:30,800
all of them come at a price to some

3056
01:49:29,279 --> 01:49:32,800
degree

3057
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:35,119
regardless of which ashigorami option

3058
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:37,840
you use there will be some degree of

3059
01:49:35,118 --> 01:49:40,079
foot exposure on my part to my opponent

3060
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:41,920
and some degree of back exposure

3061
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:44,319
on my part relative to my opponent so

3062
01:49:41,920 --> 01:49:46,800
that's the downside of it

3063
01:49:44,319 --> 01:49:48,158
variations within those different

3064
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:51,520
ashigorami

3065
01:49:48,158 --> 01:49:52,399
enable you to lessen danger in some

3066
01:49:51,520 --> 01:49:55,760
respects

3067
01:49:52,399 --> 01:49:58,319
and at the price of gaining dangers

3068
01:49:55,760 --> 01:49:59,840
in others so you get this wider array of

3069
01:49:58,319 --> 01:50:01,759
choices

3070
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:03,920
there's not this kind of simplistic

3071
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:06,159
hierarchy that you see in

3072
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:07,279
the basic positions of you but there are

3073
01:50:06,158 --> 01:50:10,158
hierarchies

3074
01:50:07,279 --> 01:50:13,679
i do for example generally favor inside

3075
01:50:10,158 --> 01:50:16,799
heel hooks over outside heel hooks

3076
01:50:13,679 --> 01:50:19,599
if i feel my opponent is very good

3077
01:50:16,800 --> 01:50:20,239
at exposing my back while i'm in

3078
01:50:19,599 --> 01:50:23,279
ashigara

3079
01:50:20,238 --> 01:50:24,879
i generally prefer 50 50 situations if i

3080
01:50:23,279 --> 01:50:26,960
believe my opponent is very good at

3081
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:29,199
counter leg locks i generally prefer

3082
01:50:26,960 --> 01:50:30,079
my feet on the inside working with

3083
01:50:29,198 --> 01:50:32,238
variations of

3084
01:50:30,079 --> 01:50:33,599
uh insights and cargo etcetera etcetera

3085
01:50:32,238 --> 01:50:36,079
so there are

3086
01:50:33,599 --> 01:50:39,840
broad heuristic rules that we can give

3087
01:50:36,079 --> 01:50:39,840
to to work in these situations

3088
01:50:41,520 --> 01:50:45,440
once you start to understand there's a

3089
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:48,158
variety

3090
01:50:45,439 --> 01:50:49,678
of entanglements you can use then you

3091
01:50:48,158 --> 01:50:50,879
start getting to the really interesting

3092
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:54,000
ideas

3093
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:57,039
that as you perform one

3094
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:59,840
given attack one given here hook you can

3095
01:50:57,039 --> 01:51:01,279
flow through different forms of

3096
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:04,719
ashigorami

3097
01:51:01,279 --> 01:51:08,399
where you can create new dangers

3098
01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:11,760
and avoid possible uh

3099
01:51:08,399 --> 01:51:13,279
pitfalls in a very short time frame as

3100
01:51:11,760 --> 01:51:14,400
you switch from one ashy grammy to

3101
01:51:13,279 --> 01:51:16,079
another over time

3102
01:51:14,399 --> 01:51:17,920
so that as your opponent's lines of

3103
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:20,000
resistance to an initial attack

3104
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:22,239
change you can accommodate those by

3105
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:24,960
switching to another form of ashigorami

3106
01:51:22,238 --> 01:51:25,439
so that your mechanism of control is

3107
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,359
always

3108
01:51:25,439 --> 01:51:29,039
pointing in opposite directions of his

3109
01:51:27,359 --> 01:51:32,559
escape

3110
01:51:29,039 --> 01:51:33,760
and if you focus on this idea of control

3111
01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:36,560
through the legs

3112
01:51:33,760 --> 01:51:37,679
you can completely change the nature of

3113
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:39,679
leg locking

3114
01:51:37,679 --> 01:51:41,920
and take it away from what it was in the

3115
01:51:39,679 --> 01:51:44,480
1990s an opportunistic

3116
01:51:41,920 --> 01:51:45,920
method of attack based upon surprise

3117
01:51:44,479 --> 01:51:49,118
speed and power

3118
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:50,639
into one based on control if you can do

3119
01:51:49,118 --> 01:51:54,000
this

3120
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:56,159
you can undermine

3121
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:57,840
many of the basic criticisms of leg

3122
01:51:56,158 --> 01:51:59,359
locking which were prevalent when i

3123
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:03,520
began

3124
01:51:59,359 --> 01:52:05,198
the sport of jujitsu for example

3125
01:52:03,520 --> 01:52:06,560
if i can completely control and

3126
01:52:05,198 --> 01:52:09,919
immobilize you

3127
01:52:06,560 --> 01:52:11,840
i can perform the lock very very safely

3128
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:14,719
if my only way of breaking your leg is

3129
01:52:11,840 --> 01:52:16,319
to be faster and more powerful than you

3130
01:52:14,719 --> 01:52:17,920
nine times out of term when i apply it

3131
01:52:16,319 --> 01:52:20,158
i'm gonna hurt your leg

3132
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:21,920
as much by accident as anything but if i

3133
01:52:20,158 --> 01:52:23,920
can completely immobilize you

3134
01:52:21,920 --> 01:52:25,039
and as every attempt you make to escape

3135
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:28,000
i can follow you

3136
01:52:25,039 --> 01:52:28,479
and immobilize you in new directions

3137
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,118
then

3138
01:52:28,479 --> 01:52:32,718
i can apply the the lock with as much

3139
01:52:31,118 --> 01:52:34,960
force or as little force

3140
01:52:32,719 --> 01:52:36,079
as possible and so you'll see in our

3141
01:52:34,960 --> 01:52:39,439
training room despite

3142
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:41,599
over considerably more than um

3143
01:52:39,439 --> 01:52:42,638
two decades sorry a decade and a half

3144
01:52:41,599 --> 01:52:46,079
now of

3145
01:52:42,639 --> 01:52:46,079
hillhawking using these methods

3146
01:52:46,158 --> 01:52:49,359
the number of people severely injured by

3147
01:52:48,238 --> 01:52:52,559
hill hawks is

3148
01:52:49,359 --> 01:52:54,158
is tiny like um

3149
01:52:52,560 --> 01:52:55,599
i would say i've seen more people

3150
01:52:54,158 --> 01:52:58,238
injured by far

3151
01:52:55,599 --> 01:52:59,920
by kimuras in the time i've been

3152
01:52:58,238 --> 01:53:03,039
training that i have by heal hawks

3153
01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:07,359
despite them having a similar twisting

3154
01:53:03,039 --> 01:53:10,000
dynamic to them if you build a culture

3155
01:53:07,359 --> 01:53:11,839
where people focus on control rather

3156
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,679
than speed of execution

3157
01:53:11,840 --> 01:53:14,880
then the injury rate goes down

3158
01:53:13,679 --> 01:53:16,800
appreciably

3159
01:53:14,880 --> 01:53:18,239
the whole idea of positional loss

3160
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,440
everyone was critically critical of leg

3161
01:53:18,238 --> 01:53:20,158
loss now if you go for leg locks and

3162
01:53:19,439 --> 01:53:22,079
they don't work

3163
01:53:20,158 --> 01:53:23,198
well now you're in trouble the guy's

3164
01:53:22,079 --> 01:53:24,840
going to be on top of you

3165
01:53:23,198 --> 01:53:26,238
they never make that criticism with arm

3166
01:53:24,840 --> 01:53:27,599
bars

3167
01:53:26,238 --> 01:53:29,439
okay you can be in the mounted position

3168
01:53:27,599 --> 01:53:31,119
go for a number end up on bottom lose

3169
01:53:29,439 --> 01:53:32,559
the armbar and lose position but

3170
01:53:31,118 --> 01:53:34,238
i've never heard anyone criticize

3171
01:53:32,560 --> 01:53:37,520
armbars on that account

3172
01:53:34,238 --> 01:53:39,198
more importantly i believed

3173
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:41,360
from early on that the best place to

3174
01:53:39,198 --> 01:53:43,439
attack leg locks is not top position

3175
01:53:41,359 --> 01:53:44,960
it's bottom position you'll see that

3176
01:53:43,439 --> 01:53:46,799
over 90 of my

3177
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:48,639
athletes attack leg locks from

3178
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:50,239
underneath people not on top of people

3179
01:53:48,639 --> 01:53:51,679
so there is no position or loss you're

3180
01:53:50,238 --> 01:53:56,238
already underneath them

3181
01:53:51,679 --> 01:53:56,239
and so that criticism was null and void

3182
01:53:56,479 --> 01:54:01,118
and by focusing on this idea of breaking

3183
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:03,119
down

3184
01:54:01,118 --> 01:54:05,920
and distinguishing between the mechanism

3185
01:54:03,118 --> 01:54:08,000
of control and the mechanism of breaking

3186
01:54:05,920 --> 01:54:09,520
that created something new and something

3187
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,719
interesting

3188
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:13,119
there was also another advantage that i

3189
01:54:12,719 --> 01:54:15,840
had

3190
01:54:13,118 --> 01:54:17,198
in terms of creating influence with leg

3191
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:18,719
locking

3192
01:54:17,198 --> 01:54:20,879
when you look at the great leg lockers

3193
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:23,039
of the past they they were basically

3194
01:54:20,880 --> 01:54:26,319
iconoclasts they were people who

3195
01:54:23,039 --> 01:54:28,829
came out of nowhere who just had

3196
01:54:26,319 --> 01:54:30,238
this remarkable success with leglocks

3197
01:54:28,829 --> 01:54:32,479
[Music]

3198
01:54:30,238 --> 01:54:32,479
but

3199
01:54:33,920 --> 01:54:37,440
they were just seen as unique

3200
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:38,880
individuals they had their game and they

3201
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:40,559
were good at it

3202
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,920
what was unique about the squad is you

3203
01:54:40,560 --> 01:54:44,480
had

3204
01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:46,000
not just one person but a team of people

3205
01:54:44,479 --> 01:54:47,759
who came out and did pretty much the

3206
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:49,439
same thing

3207
01:54:47,760 --> 01:54:52,400
these people had very different body

3208
01:54:49,439 --> 01:54:54,479
types and very different personalities

3209
01:54:52,399 --> 01:54:56,158
so it wasn't that one kind of body type

3210
01:54:54,479 --> 01:54:59,198
was good at it you had tall people

3211
01:54:56,158 --> 01:55:00,399
like gordon ryan you had uh short people

3212
01:54:59,198 --> 01:55:02,638
like nikki ryan

3213
01:55:00,399 --> 01:55:03,439
you had someone in the middle like gary

3214
01:55:02,639 --> 01:55:05,279
tonin

3215
01:55:03,439 --> 01:55:07,198
you had fast people like gary tony you

3216
01:55:05,279 --> 01:55:10,319
had slow people like gordon

3217
01:55:07,198 --> 01:55:11,759
um there were

3218
01:55:10,319 --> 01:55:13,599
there was every kind of body type

3219
01:55:11,760 --> 01:55:15,760
involved and it was like people could

3220
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:18,159
see this was different because it

3221
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:20,400
it worked for an entire team as opposed

3222
01:55:18,158 --> 01:55:21,759
to a unique individual who had unique

3223
01:55:20,399 --> 01:55:23,839
attributes

3224
01:55:21,760 --> 01:55:24,960
and that started to foster the belief

3225
01:55:23,840 --> 01:55:27,360
that

3226
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:28,399
if it can work for a team it can work

3227
01:55:27,359 --> 01:55:31,198
for anyone

3228
01:55:28,399 --> 01:55:33,198
which means it can work for me and i

3229
01:55:31,198 --> 01:55:36,399
think that had a big effect

3230
01:55:33,198 --> 01:55:39,598
that's why i owe a lot to

3231
01:55:36,399 --> 01:55:42,559
those early students um

3232
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,440
gordon ryan gary tone and eddie cummings

3233
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:46,800
and

3234
01:55:43,439 --> 01:55:47,678
uh nikki ryan there it was those four

3235
01:55:46,800 --> 01:55:50,880
kids

3236
01:55:47,679 --> 01:55:53,920
came from nowhere um uh

3237
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:56,639
gary had some success in grappling like

3238
01:55:53,920 --> 01:55:59,359
low-level success and grappling before

3239
01:55:56,639 --> 01:56:00,079
uh before becoming a full-time member of

3240
01:55:59,359 --> 01:56:03,920
the squad

3241
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:05,359
but the others were just nobodies who

3242
01:56:03,920 --> 01:56:07,599
no one had known and yet within a

3243
01:56:05,359 --> 01:56:09,198
five-year time frame they were all going

3244
01:56:07,599 --> 01:56:13,279
up against world championship

3245
01:56:09,198 --> 01:56:16,238
competition and doing exceedingly well

3246
01:56:13,279 --> 01:56:17,840
and which gives further credence the

3247
01:56:16,238 --> 01:56:19,929
idea of the five-year

3248
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:21,440
program and

3249
01:56:19,930 --> 01:56:24,480
[Music]

3250
01:56:21,439 --> 01:56:26,479
i think by operating as a team those

3251
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:27,519
young men did an incredible job of

3252
01:56:26,479 --> 01:56:29,198
convincing

3253
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:31,360
the grappling world that this wasn't

3254
01:56:29,198 --> 01:56:32,638
just about well they're just different

3255
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:34,960
or their

3256
01:56:32,639 --> 01:56:36,639
it works for their body type or or them

3257
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:39,439
as individuals it was like no

3258
01:56:36,639 --> 01:56:41,039
if a team can do it anyone can do it and

3259
01:56:39,439 --> 01:56:42,638
i think that's what really

3260
01:56:41,039 --> 01:56:44,800
convinced people that this was something

3261
01:56:42,639 --> 01:56:47,039
worth studying this is something that

3262
01:56:44,800 --> 01:56:48,000
could be a big part of their lives but

3263
01:56:47,039 --> 01:56:49,519
also convince you

3264
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:51,198
and convince convince each other in

3265
01:56:49,520 --> 01:56:52,400
those early days when you're developing

3266
01:56:51,198 --> 01:56:53,839
the science

3267
01:56:52,399 --> 01:56:55,759
essentially what was missing is an

3268
01:56:53,840 --> 01:57:00,159
entire science and system

3269
01:56:55,760 --> 01:57:02,800
of leglocks because it's not like you

3270
01:57:00,158 --> 01:57:04,638
knew for sure that there's a lot here to

3271
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:06,880
be discovered in terms of control

3272
01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:08,800
you perhaps hadn't just like you said an

3273
01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:12,319
initial intuition

3274
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:14,320
but you know you have to have enough um

3275
01:57:12,319 --> 01:57:15,840
there's perseverance required to uh take

3276
01:57:14,319 --> 01:57:17,759
is the johnny eye thing to take from the

3277
01:57:15,840 --> 01:57:21,840
initial idea to the entire system

3278
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:22,239
is there is there a sense you have about

3279
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:24,639
how

3280
01:57:22,238 --> 01:57:26,879
complicated and how big this world of

3281
01:57:24,639 --> 01:57:30,079
control

3282
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:32,480
uh in the in leg locks is

3283
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:33,439
how complicated is it you've achieved a

3284
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:35,359
lot of success

3285
01:57:33,439 --> 01:57:37,118
you have a lot of powerful ideas in

3286
01:57:35,359 --> 01:57:38,479
terms of inside outside what's high

3287
01:57:37,118 --> 01:57:40,880
percentage what's not

3288
01:57:38,479 --> 01:57:42,799
what's high reward what's low risk all

3289
01:57:40,880 --> 01:57:44,079
those kinds of things

3290
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:46,960
and then you also mentioned kind of

3291
01:57:44,079 --> 01:57:50,158
transitions not transitions but

3292
01:57:46,960 --> 01:57:53,198
how you move with your opponent to uh

3293
01:57:50,158 --> 01:57:54,960
resist their escape through control

3294
01:57:53,198 --> 01:57:57,118
this is how much do you understand about

3295
01:57:54,960 --> 01:57:57,679
this world this is a fascinating

3296
01:57:57,118 --> 01:58:01,359
question

3297
01:57:57,679 --> 01:58:03,840
um as a general rule

3298
01:58:01,359 --> 01:58:03,839
the most

3299
01:58:04,719 --> 01:58:09,840
the most powerful developments are

3300
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:13,520
always at the onset of a project

3301
01:58:09,840 --> 01:58:17,520
okay um let's give an example um

3302
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:20,000
the jet engine was uh

3303
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:21,199
i believe first conceived in the late

3304
01:58:20,000 --> 01:58:23,118
1930s

3305
01:58:21,198 --> 01:58:25,198
just around the time of world war ii it

3306
01:58:23,118 --> 01:58:27,679
was developed

3307
01:58:25,198 --> 01:58:29,919
with great pace because of world war ii

3308
01:58:27,679 --> 01:58:33,199
that obviously military research was a

3309
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:36,319
huge thing back then and first

3310
01:58:33,198 --> 01:58:40,719
fielded i believe by the germans uh

3311
01:58:36,319 --> 01:58:43,279
in around 1943. um

3312
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:45,198
jet aircraft didn't play a big role in

3313
01:58:43,279 --> 01:58:46,800
world war ii they were there at the end

3314
01:58:45,198 --> 01:58:48,879
and they did play

3315
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:52,000
a significant role but in terms of

3316
01:58:48,880 --> 01:58:52,000
numbers they just weren't there

3317
01:58:52,158 --> 01:58:58,799
so by around 1945 you had the onset

3318
01:58:55,599 --> 01:59:00,719
of the jet age and the jet engine began

3319
01:58:58,800 --> 01:59:02,960
to replace the piston engine

3320
01:59:00,719 --> 01:59:06,079
in most aircraft it was it was the new

3321
01:59:02,960 --> 01:59:10,319
way of of doing things

3322
01:59:06,079 --> 01:59:13,079
if you look at the pace of development

3323
01:59:10,319 --> 01:59:15,519
of jet engine aircraft technology from

3324
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:18,840
1945

3325
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:21,760
to 1960 it is

3326
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:24,960
unbelievable there was a

3327
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:28,000
solid decade where they were gaining

3328
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:31,039
almost 100 miles an hour per year

3329
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:34,880
for a decade that's a form of growth

3330
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:35,760
that i mean in the world of engineering

3331
01:59:34,880 --> 01:59:37,840
that's

3332
01:59:35,760 --> 01:59:39,440
that's the only time you see growth like

3333
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:43,840
that is on things like bitcoin

3334
01:59:39,439 --> 01:59:46,960
and that's about it okay um uh

3335
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:50,480
let's put things in perspective okay um

3336
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:51,039
in world war ii the standard us aircraft

3337
01:59:50,479 --> 01:59:54,479
bomber

3338
01:59:51,039 --> 01:59:56,719
was the b-17 which was a

3339
01:59:54,479 --> 01:59:59,439
mid-sized bomber with a fairly limited

3340
01:59:56,719 --> 02:00:02,158
load capacity and

3341
01:59:59,439 --> 02:00:04,399
i think top speed well below 300 miles

3342
02:00:02,158 --> 02:00:08,079
an hour

3343
02:00:04,399 --> 02:00:10,158
just 10 years later you had the b-52

3344
02:00:08,079 --> 02:00:12,238
which could fly across continents and

3345
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:14,638
deliver nuclear weapons

3346
02:00:12,238 --> 02:00:16,079
and carry bomb loads of up to 70 000

3347
02:00:14,639 --> 02:00:19,440
pounds

3348
02:00:16,079 --> 02:00:22,960
uh in a decade that happened

3349
02:00:19,439 --> 02:00:26,000
i if you took a b-17 pilot

3350
02:00:22,960 --> 02:00:28,639
in 1943 and put them inside a b-52

3351
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:30,158
a decade later he would literally think

3352
02:00:28,639 --> 02:00:33,359
he was on a ufo

3353
02:00:30,158 --> 02:00:34,399
a ship from another planet that was the

3354
02:00:33,359 --> 02:00:38,000
speed

3355
02:00:34,399 --> 02:00:40,879
of development now contrast that

3356
02:00:38,000 --> 02:00:43,520
with the speed of modern development if

3357
02:00:40,880 --> 02:00:46,560
i took you in a time machine

3358
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:49,679
and i put you in a civil airliner

3359
02:00:46,560 --> 02:00:53,039
in 1972

3360
02:00:49,679 --> 02:00:54,880
let's say a boeing 737 it's not that

3361
02:00:53,039 --> 02:00:57,198
different from what you fly in today

3362
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:59,039
that's right flies at the same speed has

3363
02:00:57,198 --> 02:01:01,519
the same range

3364
02:00:59,039 --> 02:01:02,800
flies at the same altitude it's not that

3365
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:05,840
different

3366
02:01:02,800 --> 02:01:10,320
the amount of progress between 1973

3367
02:01:05,840 --> 02:01:13,520
and 2020 isn't very impressive

3368
02:01:10,319 --> 02:01:16,479
but the amount of progress from 1945

3369
02:01:13,520 --> 02:01:18,480
to 1955 or even better 1960 was

3370
02:01:16,479 --> 02:01:21,598
staggering

3371
02:01:18,479 --> 02:01:24,479
and so the initial progress tends to be

3372
02:01:21,599 --> 02:01:25,599
meteoric but after that it tends to be

3373
02:01:24,479 --> 02:01:28,479
incremental

3374
02:01:25,599 --> 02:01:30,319
that's that with lake longs there's a

3375
02:01:28,479 --> 02:01:32,638
guy named elon musk

3376
02:01:30,319 --> 02:01:34,880
there's been almost no development in

3377
02:01:32,639 --> 02:01:38,800
terms of uh

3378
02:01:34,880 --> 02:01:42,480
space rocket propulsion

3379
02:01:38,800 --> 02:01:45,599
and rocket launches and going out

3380
02:01:42,479 --> 02:01:48,879
into orbit or going out into deep space

3381
02:01:45,599 --> 02:01:50,159
and one guy comes along one john donahue

3382
02:01:48,880 --> 02:01:52,400
type character

3383
02:01:50,158 --> 02:01:54,799
and says it doesn't make sense why we

3384
02:01:52,399 --> 02:01:56,799
don't use reusable rockets

3385
02:01:54,800 --> 02:01:59,199
why we don't make it much cheaper why we

3386
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:01,679
don't launch every week as opposed to

3387
02:01:59,198 --> 02:02:03,039
every few years it doesn't make any

3388
02:02:01,679 --> 02:02:04,800
sense why we don't

3389
02:02:03,039 --> 02:02:06,319
go to the moon again over and over and

3390
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:09,360
over it doesn't make any sense why we

3391
02:02:06,319 --> 02:02:14,000
don't go to mars and colonize mars

3392
02:02:09,359 --> 02:02:16,960
it feels like it's not just a single

3393
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:18,319
jump to a b-52 it's a series of these

3394
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:21,679
kinds of jumps

3395
02:02:18,319 --> 02:02:24,639
so the question is is there another leap

3396
02:02:21,679 --> 02:02:25,359
within the leg locking system time will

3397
02:02:24,639 --> 02:02:29,039
tell

3398
02:02:25,359 --> 02:02:31,598
um i do believe that

3399
02:02:29,039 --> 02:02:32,319
we're in a phase now where the really

3400
02:02:31,599 --> 02:02:34,400
big

3401
02:02:32,319 --> 02:02:36,000
jumps have already been made and we're

3402
02:02:34,399 --> 02:02:36,879
we're in the incremental phase at this

3403
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:39,118
point

3404
02:02:36,880 --> 02:02:41,520
um what i do believe is that you will

3405
02:02:39,118 --> 02:02:43,279
start to see new directions

3406
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,960
start to emerge where you start to see

3407
02:02:43,279 --> 02:02:46,399
the interface between leg locking and

3408
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:48,719
wrestling for example

3409
02:02:46,399 --> 02:02:50,399
the interface between leg locking and

3410
02:02:48,719 --> 02:02:52,880
back attacks and that will provide

3411
02:02:50,399 --> 02:02:54,000
new avenues of direction which will

3412
02:02:52,880 --> 02:02:57,520
provide

3413
02:02:54,000 --> 02:03:00,399
create new spurs of growth

3414
02:02:57,520 --> 02:03:02,159
but in terms of uh breaking people's

3415
02:03:00,399 --> 02:03:02,960
legs this the simple act of breaking

3416
02:03:02,158 --> 02:03:04,559
legs i

3417
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:06,719
i believe we're in the incremental phase

3418
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:08,639
now rather than the meteoric phase

3419
02:03:06,719 --> 02:03:10,960
let me ask you a ridiculous question how

3420
02:03:08,639 --> 02:03:12,719
hard is it to actually break a leg this

3421
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:14,480
is something you think about i remember

3422
02:03:12,719 --> 02:03:15,920
because i'm a big fan of the straight

3423
02:03:14,479 --> 02:03:18,079
foot lock

3424
02:03:15,920 --> 02:03:19,679
not again we're talking about to the

3425
02:03:18,079 --> 02:03:21,679
standing sanagi

3426
02:03:19,679 --> 02:03:23,279
maybe it's my uh russian roots with

3427
02:03:21,679 --> 02:03:24,800
samba or something like that maybe it's

3428
02:03:23,279 --> 02:03:28,238
the dean lister

3429
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:30,320
uh achilles lock but i i love

3430
02:03:28,238 --> 02:03:33,919
maybe it's my body something like that i

3431
02:03:30,319 --> 02:03:38,158
just love the squeeze of it the control

3432
02:03:33,920 --> 02:03:41,599
and the power of a straight foot lock

3433
02:03:38,158 --> 02:03:43,759
and i remember

3434
02:03:41,599 --> 02:03:44,960
trying to there's a few people in

3435
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:48,480
competition that

3436
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:50,719
didn't want to attack absolutely and

3437
02:03:48,479 --> 02:03:53,039
i remember in particular there was one

3438
02:03:50,719 --> 02:03:54,000
one person it was a again a finals match

3439
02:03:53,039 --> 02:03:55,920
purple belt

3440
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:58,399
i remember it was a straight foot lock

3441
02:03:55,920 --> 02:04:01,199
is perfect everything's just perfect

3442
02:03:58,399 --> 02:04:03,359
and i remember going all in and there

3443
02:04:01,198 --> 02:04:05,519
was a pop pop pop

3444
02:04:03,359 --> 02:04:06,880
and i couldn't do anything more it

3445
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:08,639
wasn't breaking

3446
02:04:06,880 --> 02:04:10,880
it was it was just bending and bending

3447
02:04:08,639 --> 02:04:14,239
and bending and there's damage to it

3448
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:16,159
of some kind but i wanted to like

3449
02:04:14,238 --> 02:04:17,919
you know i wanted to see first of all

3450
02:04:16,158 --> 02:04:18,879
it's very difficult psychologically

3451
02:04:17,920 --> 02:04:21,199
because it's like

3452
02:04:18,880 --> 02:04:22,078
can i be violent here that wasn't a

3453
02:04:21,198 --> 02:04:24,000
whole nother

3454
02:04:22,078 --> 02:04:26,158
thing with adrenaline you can't really

3455
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:26,479
think that fast but i also thought like

3456
02:04:26,158 --> 02:04:28,559
where

3457
02:04:26,479 --> 02:04:30,158
where else is there to go like is it the

3458
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:30,960
shin going to break what is supposed to

3459
02:04:30,158 --> 02:04:32,799
break

3460
02:04:30,960 --> 02:04:33,920
so i wonder yeah in the case of the

3461
02:04:32,800 --> 02:04:35,520
achilles log it's going to be the

3462
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:37,760
anterior tibialis tendon

3463
02:04:35,520 --> 02:04:38,800
and what's that uh let's see it runs

3464
02:04:37,760 --> 02:04:40,320
down there's two of them

3465
02:04:38,800 --> 02:04:42,320
uh it'll be the minor one that runs on

3466
02:04:40,319 --> 02:04:43,920
the outside of the front of the ankle

3467
02:04:42,319 --> 02:04:45,679
um it's not going to be the achilles

3468
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:48,000
tendon a lot of people

3469
02:04:45,679 --> 02:04:48,880
promulgate this uh this absurdity the

3470
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:51,359
achilles tendon

3471
02:04:48,880 --> 02:04:52,800
can rupture but not from pressure it's

3472
02:04:51,359 --> 02:04:56,000
rather tender not the bone

3473
02:04:52,800 --> 02:04:58,719
it's going to break the bone won't break

3474
02:04:56,000 --> 02:04:59,279
i have seen on one occasion a shin bone

3475
02:04:58,719 --> 02:05:01,679
break

3476
02:04:59,279 --> 02:05:02,559
from an achilles log but there was a

3477
02:05:01,679 --> 02:05:05,520
enormous

3478
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:07,119
size and strength disparity and there

3479
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:07,840
may have been other complicating factors

3480
02:05:07,118 --> 02:05:11,359
too

3481
02:05:07,840 --> 02:05:14,000
um but in the vast majority of cases

3482
02:05:11,359 --> 02:05:15,759
the achilles lock doesn't really do

3483
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:17,359
tremendous damage it can

3484
02:05:15,760 --> 02:05:19,119
do significant damage you'll definitely

3485
02:05:17,359 --> 02:05:21,598
feel it the next day but it's

3486
02:05:19,118 --> 02:05:23,279
of all the major logs it's the one where

3487
02:05:21,599 --> 02:05:25,199
it is most likely

3488
02:05:23,279 --> 02:05:26,880
a psychologically strong opponent will

3489
02:05:25,198 --> 02:05:28,000
be able to absorb damage and go on to

3490
02:05:26,880 --> 02:05:30,560
win a match

3491
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:32,479
um and answer to your first question how

3492
02:05:30,560 --> 02:05:35,920
difficult is it to break a leg

3493
02:05:32,479 --> 02:05:37,678
um not very difficult it will

3494
02:05:35,920 --> 02:05:39,279
come down to what is the skill level of

3495
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:40,800
my opponent's resistance if your boner

3496
02:05:39,279 --> 02:05:41,599
is not resisting and you have an inside

3497
02:05:40,800 --> 02:05:44,239
heel hook it is

3498
02:05:41,599 --> 02:05:45,679
absurdly easy to break a man's leg not a

3499
02:05:44,238 --> 02:05:48,559
challenge at all

3500
02:05:45,679 --> 02:05:49,599
um you can be a 105 pound woman could

3501
02:05:48,560 --> 02:05:52,800
easily

3502
02:05:49,599 --> 02:05:56,000
snap um the the relevant

3503
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:57,599
knee ligaments uh in a 240 pound

3504
02:05:56,000 --> 02:05:59,760
man's leg if he doesn't know how to

3505
02:05:57,599 --> 02:06:03,039
defend himself that's an easy thing

3506
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:06,079
very easy to accomplish so

3507
02:06:03,039 --> 02:06:07,920
the basic answer is yes it's very easy

3508
02:06:06,078 --> 02:06:10,399
if your opponent does know how to defend

3509
02:06:07,920 --> 02:06:12,960
and they can position their foot

3510
02:06:10,399 --> 02:06:14,559
play tricks of lever and fulcrum it

3511
02:06:12,960 --> 02:06:15,198
becomes significantly more difficult it

3512
02:06:14,560 --> 02:06:16,960
becomes

3513
02:06:15,198 --> 02:06:18,399
still more difficult under match

3514
02:06:16,960 --> 02:06:19,760
conditions where they're actively

3515
02:06:18,399 --> 02:06:22,960
looking to

3516
02:06:19,760 --> 02:06:24,239
position their body and work their way

3517
02:06:22,960 --> 02:06:27,359
out of the lock then it can

3518
02:06:24,238 --> 02:06:31,279
become very difficult indeed

3519
02:06:27,359 --> 02:06:33,920
always bear in mind that there have been

3520
02:06:31,279 --> 02:06:34,559
some cases in our history as a team

3521
02:06:33,920 --> 02:06:36,960
where

3522
02:06:34,560 --> 02:06:39,280
people have literally just let their

3523
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:39,279
knees

3524
02:06:39,520 --> 02:06:44,880
snap and continue fighting

3525
02:06:43,039 --> 02:06:47,679
always remember that submission is a

3526
02:06:44,880 --> 02:06:50,560
choice when it comes to the joint locks

3527
02:06:47,679 --> 02:06:51,760
and uh we've had some people who just

3528
02:06:50,560 --> 02:06:54,400
made the choice and i

3529
02:06:51,760 --> 02:06:55,039
i'm willing to let my knee break so that

3530
02:06:54,399 --> 02:06:57,198
i can

3531
02:06:55,039 --> 02:06:58,719
can continue in this match that's a

3532
02:06:57,198 --> 02:06:59,919
tough decision to make and i admire

3533
02:06:58,719 --> 02:07:02,480
their bravery

3534
02:06:59,920 --> 02:07:04,880
um is there something about that just to

3535
02:07:02,479 --> 02:07:07,759
speak to that that you you admire

3536
02:07:04,880 --> 02:07:09,840
yes yeah it's mental toughness i would i

3537
02:07:07,760 --> 02:07:11,840
agree with it would i advocate it no

3538
02:07:09,840 --> 02:07:14,319
um but that doesn't mean i can't admire

3539
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:18,159
aspects of it

3540
02:07:14,319 --> 02:07:22,158
who is the greatest grappler ever

3541
02:07:18,158 --> 02:07:24,399
you were very astute in the way you

3542
02:07:22,158 --> 02:07:26,000
asked that question you didn't say the

3543
02:07:24,399 --> 02:07:28,078
greatest jujitsu player

3544
02:07:26,000 --> 02:07:29,359
of all time you specified grappler

3545
02:07:28,078 --> 02:07:30,880
what's the bigger

3546
02:07:29,359 --> 02:07:33,839
category jiu-jitsu is the bigger

3547
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:36,560
category jujitsu has four faces

3548
02:07:33,840 --> 02:07:37,599
there is ghee competition there is no

3549
02:07:36,560 --> 02:07:40,079
ghee competition

3550
02:07:37,599 --> 02:07:41,760
there is mixed martial arts competition

3551
02:07:40,078 --> 02:07:44,799
and there is self-defense

3552
02:07:41,760 --> 02:07:48,239
so jiu-jitsu has four aspects

3553
02:07:44,800 --> 02:07:49,599
grappling typically refers only to the

3554
02:07:48,238 --> 02:07:51,439
nogi

3555
02:07:49,599 --> 02:07:53,039
aspect of jiu-jitsu so it's one out of

3556
02:07:51,439 --> 02:07:54,799
four possibilities

3557
02:07:53,039 --> 02:07:56,479
so who's the greatest jiu jitsu

3558
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:58,000
practitioner ever

3559
02:07:56,479 --> 02:07:59,919
and then who is the greatest grappler

3560
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,800
ever i believe

3561
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:03,520
that the greatest jujitsu player

3562
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:06,880
certainly that

3563
02:08:03,520 --> 02:08:08,639
i ever met and i believe of all time i i

3564
02:08:06,880 --> 02:08:10,000
i don't want to sound arrogant on that

3565
02:08:08,639 --> 02:08:11,359
because really you can only go with your

3566
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,198
own experiences and there are

3567
02:08:11,359 --> 02:08:15,039
some great athletes that other people

3568
02:08:13,198 --> 02:08:18,078
mentioned that i i just never met

3569
02:08:15,039 --> 02:08:19,359
so but in my estimation the greatest jiu

3570
02:08:18,078 --> 02:08:23,279
jitsu player

3571
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:27,759
is hodger gracie my reasoning for that

3572
02:08:23,279 --> 02:08:31,439
is out of the four faces of jiu-jitsu

3573
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:34,400
he excelled in three

3574
02:08:31,439 --> 02:08:36,000
and in two of them in particular he was

3575
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:37,359
the best of his generation by a

3576
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:40,479
landslide

3577
02:08:37,359 --> 02:08:43,759
um in ghee grappling

3578
02:08:40,479 --> 02:08:47,519
nogi grappling hodger dominated

3579
02:08:43,760 --> 02:08:51,520
his generation to a degree that

3580
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:52,960
is truly impressive

3581
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:54,480
what do you attribute that dominance to

3582
02:08:52,960 --> 02:08:56,000
by the way is there something if you

3583
02:08:54,479 --> 02:08:57,678
were to analyze them

3584
02:08:56,000 --> 02:09:00,238
fascinating question i'll come back to

3585
02:08:57,679 --> 02:09:03,440
it in mixed martial arts

3586
02:09:00,238 --> 02:09:06,399
he was at his peak

3587
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:07,359
i believe ranked in the top ten in the

3588
02:09:06,399 --> 02:09:09,439
uh

3589
02:09:07,359 --> 02:09:10,799
in the world of mixed martial arts uh he

3590
02:09:09,439 --> 02:09:12,399
wasn't the best

3591
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:14,239
in mixed martial arts the way he was in

3592
02:09:12,399 --> 02:09:17,519
grappling but he was damn good

3593
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:19,839
and he beat some significant people so

3594
02:09:17,520 --> 02:09:21,760
he showed tremendous versatility ghee

3595
02:09:19,840 --> 02:09:23,279
nogi mixed martial arts

3596
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:25,119
he's not really known in the world of

3597
02:09:23,279 --> 02:09:26,880
self-defense but there's no real

3598
02:09:25,118 --> 02:09:28,479
criteria by which you would become

3599
02:09:26,880 --> 02:09:29,118
dominant in self-defense so that's kind

3600
02:09:28,479 --> 02:09:30,959
of a

3601
02:09:29,118 --> 02:09:32,399
you can't really judge people by that

3602
02:09:30,960 --> 02:09:33,760
i'm believing i'm

3603
02:09:32,399 --> 02:09:36,078
if i thought you got into a fight in the

3604
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:39,679
street i'm sure he would do just fine

3605
02:09:36,078 --> 02:09:42,078
so i i had no concerns about that um

3606
02:09:39,679 --> 02:09:44,399
uh so i would say that if you look at

3607
02:09:42,078 --> 02:09:47,519
jujitsu for what i believe it is a

3608
02:09:44,399 --> 02:09:49,920
sport with four faces i believe it's

3609
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:51,440
uh you you have to go with roger gracie

3610
02:09:49,920 --> 02:09:54,639
as uh the one who

3611
02:09:51,439 --> 02:09:57,839
went out and empirically proved his

3612
02:09:54,639 --> 02:10:00,400
ability to to go across those those

3613
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:01,039
elements and do extraordinarily well in

3614
02:10:00,399 --> 02:10:03,598
all of them

3615
02:10:01,039 --> 02:10:05,519
he even made the um the extraordinary

3616
02:10:03,599 --> 02:10:06,800
step of coming out of retirement and

3617
02:10:05,520 --> 02:10:09,360
beating the best

3618
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:09,920
of the generation that came after him

3619
02:10:09,359 --> 02:10:12,078
and that's

3620
02:10:09,920 --> 02:10:13,679
sure yes that's a truly difficult sounds

3621
02:10:12,078 --> 02:10:15,439
incredible yeah and a sport which

3622
02:10:13,679 --> 02:10:17,359
progresses very very rapidly that's a

3623
02:10:15,439 --> 02:10:20,479
truly impressive accomplishment

3624
02:10:17,359 --> 02:10:21,279
um if you ask the question who is the

3625
02:10:20,479 --> 02:10:24,879
greatest

3626
02:10:21,279 --> 02:10:26,078
grappler that i've ever seen uh i would

3627
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:27,440
say

3628
02:10:26,078 --> 02:10:29,359
i've never seen anyone better than

3629
02:10:27,439 --> 02:10:31,919
gordon ryan um

3630
02:10:29,359 --> 02:10:33,118
now people are going to jump when i give

3631
02:10:31,920 --> 02:10:33,440
these two names they're going to say

3632
02:10:33,118 --> 02:10:35,439
well

3633
02:10:33,439 --> 02:10:37,118
daniel you're close friends with hodger

3634
02:10:35,439 --> 02:10:40,479
and you're close friends with

3635
02:10:37,118 --> 02:10:43,279
gordon so you're biased um i i

3636
02:10:40,479 --> 02:10:44,879
can't answer them to that it's true i'm

3637
02:10:43,279 --> 02:10:48,639
good friends with both of them

3638
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:51,199
um i'm also a notoriously cold and

3639
02:10:48,639 --> 02:10:53,199
unemotional person and i'm saying this

3640
02:10:51,198 --> 02:10:55,759
based upon

3641
02:10:53,198 --> 02:10:56,719
things that i've observed if i honestly

3642
02:10:55,760 --> 02:10:58,239
believed that

3643
02:10:56,719 --> 02:11:00,158
i'd seen other people who were better i

3644
02:10:58,238 --> 02:11:03,359
would have said it um

3645
02:11:00,158 --> 02:11:04,479
that's i will that convince the people

3646
02:11:03,359 --> 02:11:07,679
who

3647
02:11:04,479 --> 02:11:08,879
uh criticize me of bias probably not but

3648
02:11:07,679 --> 02:11:10,719
those are the two names that i will

3649
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:13,118
mention i think it's uncontroversial

3650
02:11:10,719 --> 02:11:17,118
statement to say that uh gordon ryan

3651
02:11:13,118 --> 02:11:18,559
is one of the the greatest grappler ever

3652
02:11:17,118 --> 02:11:20,319
yeah gordon's obviously a very

3653
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:22,639
polarizing figure and

3654
02:11:20,319 --> 02:11:24,000
people tend to react to gordon on an

3655
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:27,279
emotional level rather than

3656
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:29,920
a statistical level and

3657
02:11:27,279 --> 02:11:31,439
that colors a lot of people's minds but

3658
02:11:29,920 --> 02:11:33,118
i also have the benefit that i've seen

3659
02:11:31,439 --> 02:11:33,598
both of these guys extensively in the

3660
02:11:33,118 --> 02:11:34,960
gym

3661
02:11:33,599 --> 02:11:37,360
and that all adds a whole new

3662
02:11:34,960 --> 02:11:38,399
perspective like if you think those guys

3663
02:11:37,359 --> 02:11:40,799
are dominant

3664
02:11:38,399 --> 02:11:42,638
on the stage wait till you see them in

3665
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:43,520
the gym it's even a different level of

3666
02:11:42,639 --> 02:11:45,679
domination

3667
02:11:43,520 --> 02:11:47,440
uh above and beyond what they did in

3668
02:11:45,679 --> 02:11:50,000
competition

3669
02:11:47,439 --> 02:11:51,359
have they trained against each other no

3670
02:11:50,000 --> 02:11:53,039
they never trained together they've been

3671
02:11:51,359 --> 02:11:53,598
in the same gym i think only on one

3672
02:11:53,039 --> 02:11:55,439
occasion

3673
02:11:53,599 --> 02:11:57,520
when haju was stopped by new york he

3674
02:11:55,439 --> 02:12:00,000
came back and came by to say hello and

3675
02:11:57,520 --> 02:12:00,719
uh gordon was here at the time they they

3676
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:03,118
shake hands

3677
02:12:00,719 --> 02:12:04,719
they know each other and they're both

3678
02:12:03,118 --> 02:12:08,238
wonderful people in their own way

3679
02:12:04,719 --> 02:12:13,039
so i'd like to talk to you about gordon

3680
02:12:08,238 --> 02:12:14,879
hodger and george gsb

3681
02:12:13,039 --> 02:12:16,319
let's first talk about what do you think

3682
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:17,679
is this very different

3683
02:12:16,319 --> 02:12:20,399
from my perspective maybe you can

3684
02:12:17,679 --> 02:12:24,480
correct me a very different

3685
02:12:20,399 --> 02:12:28,319
artists yes masters of their uh pursuits

3686
02:12:24,479 --> 02:12:32,078
so what makes hajir so good

3687
02:12:28,319 --> 02:12:35,359
hoja was probably the living embodiment

3688
02:12:32,078 --> 02:12:37,920
of someone who played a classical

3689
02:12:35,359 --> 02:12:39,439
jujitsu game based around the the

3690
02:12:37,920 --> 02:12:42,399
fundamental

3691
02:12:39,439 --> 02:12:43,439
four steps of jiu-jitsu and and um uh

3692
02:12:42,399 --> 02:12:46,960
like if

3693
02:12:43,439 --> 02:12:49,439
if you took someone who had

3694
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:50,000
taken introduction lessons in jiu-jitsu

3695
02:12:49,439 --> 02:12:53,598
for

3696
02:12:50,000 --> 02:12:57,520
three months they would recognize

3697
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:59,440
the outlines of hodges game

3698
02:12:57,520 --> 02:13:02,560
with many of the techniques they learned

3699
02:12:59,439 --> 02:13:05,919
in those first three months

3700
02:13:02,560 --> 02:13:07,360
hodger was the best example of the

3701
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:10,800
dichotomy between

3702
02:13:07,359 --> 02:13:13,359
the fundamentals of jiu-jitsu but also a

3703
02:13:10,800 --> 02:13:17,520
kind of hidden sophistication

3704
02:13:13,359 --> 02:13:18,880
underneath those fundamentals

3705
02:13:17,520 --> 02:13:20,719
people always say oh you know hodges

3706
02:13:18,880 --> 02:13:23,440
game was so basic

3707
02:13:20,719 --> 02:13:24,319
no the outlines of hodges game were

3708
02:13:23,439 --> 02:13:26,479
basic

3709
02:13:24,319 --> 02:13:30,238
but the degree of sophistication and the

3710
02:13:26,479 --> 02:13:34,559
application was extraordinary

3711
02:13:30,238 --> 02:13:39,519
and his ability to refine

3712
02:13:34,560 --> 02:13:42,400
existing technology was truly impressive

3713
02:13:39,520 --> 02:13:44,239
i never saw anyone in his generation

3714
02:13:42,399 --> 02:13:46,799
that even came close to his

3715
02:13:44,238 --> 02:13:47,598
uh his ability both in competition and

3716
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:50,159
uh

3717
02:13:47,599 --> 02:13:50,639
uh in the gym so for people who don't

3718
02:13:50,158 --> 02:13:52,479
know

3719
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:54,480
how to gracie basically use just like

3720
02:13:52,479 --> 02:13:57,598
you said a very

3721
02:13:54,479 --> 02:14:01,118
simple techniques on the surface

3722
02:13:57,599 --> 02:14:03,360
from the outsider's perspective that uh

3723
02:14:01,118 --> 02:14:04,319
most people learn when they start jiu

3724
02:14:03,359 --> 02:14:05,920
jitsu

3725
02:14:04,319 --> 02:14:07,359
like a passing guard in a very simple

3726
02:14:05,920 --> 02:14:10,880
way taking mount

3727
02:14:07,359 --> 02:14:13,519
and choking from mount also

3728
02:14:10,880 --> 02:14:15,199
when he's on his back this closed guard

3729
02:14:13,520 --> 02:14:16,400
and all the basic submissions from coast

3730
02:14:15,198 --> 02:14:20,638
guard armbar and

3731
02:14:16,399 --> 02:14:24,479
triangle and just that's it

3732
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:27,679
and being able to dominate shut down

3733
02:14:24,479 --> 02:14:29,439
and submit so control and submit the

3734
02:14:27,679 --> 02:14:32,399
best people in the world

3735
02:14:29,439 --> 02:14:33,359
for many many years just like you said

3736
02:14:32,399 --> 02:14:36,319
including

3737
02:14:33,359 --> 02:14:37,359
coming out of retirement and beating the

3738
02:14:36,319 --> 02:14:39,279
best

3739
02:14:37,359 --> 02:14:40,559
perhaps by far the best of the next

3740
02:14:39,279 --> 02:14:42,639
generation

3741
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:45,280
so that's that just kind of lays out the

3742
02:14:42,639 --> 02:14:49,039
story is there some lessons

3743
02:14:45,279 --> 02:14:52,000
about his systems

3744
02:14:49,039 --> 02:14:52,399
that you uh learn in developing your own

3745
02:14:52,000 --> 02:14:55,359
system

3746
02:14:52,399 --> 02:14:57,118
excellent question the the thing which

3747
02:14:55,359 --> 02:15:00,319
always impressed me the most about

3748
02:14:57,118 --> 02:15:03,920
uh hodgeo was

3749
02:15:00,319 --> 02:15:06,238
his relentless pursuit of uh

3750
02:15:03,920 --> 02:15:07,199
of position to submission everything was

3751
02:15:06,238 --> 02:15:10,319
done

3752
02:15:07,198 --> 02:15:14,559
with the belief that

3753
02:15:10,319 --> 02:15:16,799
no victory was worthwhile if it didn't

3754
02:15:14,560 --> 02:15:19,679
involve submitting his opponent

3755
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:22,639
that's a mindset that i try very very

3756
02:15:19,679 --> 02:15:24,480
hard to imbue in my students the easiest

3757
02:15:22,639 --> 02:15:25,440
part to victory in jiu-jitsu is the one

3758
02:15:24,479 --> 02:15:28,559
which

3759
02:15:25,439 --> 02:15:30,479
takes the least risk so for example you

3760
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:32,639
will see many modern athletes

3761
02:15:30,479 --> 02:15:34,479
focus on scoring the first point or the

3762
02:15:32,639 --> 02:15:36,639
fourth first advantage and then doing

3763
02:15:34,479 --> 02:15:40,078
the minimum amount of work

3764
02:15:36,639 --> 02:15:42,078
to each out a victory once they've done

3765
02:15:40,078 --> 02:15:44,078
that they get a small tactical advantage

3766
02:15:42,078 --> 02:15:45,599
they realize they're ahead take no more

3767
02:15:44,078 --> 02:15:47,519
risks and just

3768
02:15:45,599 --> 02:15:49,039
do the minimum amount of work to get the

3769
02:15:47,520 --> 02:15:52,159
victory

3770
02:15:49,039 --> 02:15:55,039
hodges mindset was always to take

3771
02:15:52,158 --> 02:15:56,638
the riskier gambit of submission which

3772
02:15:55,039 --> 02:16:00,238
entails a lot more work

3773
02:15:56,639 --> 02:16:00,239
and in many cases a lot more skill

3774
02:16:01,198 --> 02:16:04,638
what i always liked about hodger is he

3775
02:16:03,279 --> 02:16:08,479
never tried to play

3776
02:16:04,639 --> 02:16:12,960
tactics it was always just go out there

3777
02:16:08,479 --> 02:16:16,399
and try to win by submission and

3778
02:16:12,960 --> 02:16:19,520
that more than anything that mindset of

3779
02:16:16,399 --> 02:16:21,759
looking for the most perfect victory

3780
02:16:19,520 --> 02:16:22,960
rather than the victory that takes the

3781
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:26,400
least skill

3782
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:27,920
and the least effort is probably the

3783
02:16:26,399 --> 02:16:30,839
the thing i took from his career the

3784
02:16:27,920 --> 02:16:32,478
most and tried to work upon in my

3785
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:34,799
students

3786
02:16:32,478 --> 02:16:36,239
i always wonder what are the little

3787
02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:38,159
details he's doing

3788
02:16:36,239 --> 02:16:39,439
under there when he's in mount the

3789
02:16:38,159 --> 02:16:41,280
little adjustments

3790
02:16:39,439 --> 02:16:43,200
you know but perhaps that's like almost

3791
02:16:41,280 --> 02:16:47,599
indescribable

3792
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:50,479
the the details of that control

3793
02:16:47,599 --> 02:16:51,439
what makes gordon ryan the greatest

3794
02:16:50,478 --> 02:16:54,799
grappler

3795
02:16:51,439 --> 02:16:56,800
of all time so good with gordon he's

3796
02:16:54,799 --> 02:16:58,079
also very strong on fundamentals all of

3797
02:16:56,799 --> 02:17:02,000
my students are

3798
02:16:58,079 --> 02:17:03,120
but he's also obviously a member of a

3799
02:17:02,000 --> 02:17:05,679
new generation of

3800
02:17:03,120 --> 02:17:07,439
nogi grapplers that also bring in

3801
02:17:05,679 --> 02:17:10,239
technologies that

3802
02:17:07,439 --> 02:17:12,840
uh weren't really emphasized in previous

3803
02:17:10,239 --> 02:17:16,558
generations specifically

3804
02:17:12,840 --> 02:17:20,318
the prolific use of lower body attacks

3805
02:17:16,558 --> 02:17:22,159
especially from bottom position um

3806
02:17:20,318 --> 02:17:24,959
this means that he can play a game

3807
02:17:22,159 --> 02:17:27,439
between upper body and lower body

3808
02:17:24,959 --> 02:17:29,358
which was not really a part of hodge's

3809
02:17:27,439 --> 02:17:30,960
game

3810
02:17:29,359 --> 02:17:33,040
nonetheless you will also see

3811
02:17:30,959 --> 02:17:34,318
significant similarities he's got a very

3812
02:17:33,040 --> 02:17:36,639
strong and crushing

3813
02:17:34,318 --> 02:17:37,679
passing game to mount and a very strong

3814
02:17:36,638 --> 02:17:42,558
and crushing

3815
02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:46,558
passing game to the back um

3816
02:17:42,558 --> 02:17:47,358
you will see that the major differences

3817
02:17:46,558 --> 02:17:49,920
between the two

3818
02:17:47,359 --> 02:17:51,280
are from bottom position hodges bottom

3819
02:17:49,920 --> 02:17:52,239
game is essentially based around his

3820
02:17:51,280 --> 02:17:53,920
close guard

3821
02:17:52,239 --> 02:17:55,359
gordon ryan's game is based around his

3822
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:57,359
butterfly guard

3823
02:17:55,359 --> 02:18:00,000
so one is based on outside control and

3824
02:17:57,359 --> 02:18:02,159
one is based on inside control

3825
02:18:00,000 --> 02:18:03,840
one focuses almost entirely on the

3826
02:18:02,159 --> 02:18:05,679
classical notion of

3827
02:18:03,840 --> 02:18:07,359
getting past the legs to the upper body

3828
02:18:05,679 --> 02:18:08,960
and the other one works between the two

3829
02:18:07,359 --> 02:18:10,479
as alternatives and sees them as

3830
02:18:08,959 --> 02:18:12,478
competing alternatives

3831
02:18:10,478 --> 02:18:14,159
where the stronger you become at one the

3832
02:18:12,478 --> 02:18:16,000
more your opponent has to overreact and

3833
02:18:14,159 --> 02:18:18,638
become vulnerable to the second

3834
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:20,079
so they have strong similarities in top

3835
02:18:18,638 --> 02:18:22,239
position but are very different in

3836
02:18:20,079 --> 02:18:25,359
bottom

3837
02:18:22,239 --> 02:18:29,119
he has uh from an outsider's perspective

3838
02:18:25,359 --> 02:18:32,559
a calm to him in the uh

3839
02:18:29,120 --> 02:18:35,519
in the heat of battle that's like

3840
02:18:32,558 --> 02:18:36,239
uh that's inspiring and confusing is

3841
02:18:35,519 --> 02:18:38,639
there

3842
02:18:36,239 --> 02:18:40,638
something to speak to the psychological

3843
02:18:38,638 --> 02:18:44,558
aspect of gordon ryan

3844
02:18:40,638 --> 02:18:48,398
yes people will talk

3845
02:18:44,558 --> 02:18:52,079
all day about sports psychology and

3846
02:18:48,398 --> 02:18:53,439
um they will often have heated arguments

3847
02:18:52,079 --> 02:18:55,120
as to what's the right side

3848
02:18:53,439 --> 02:18:56,559
psychological state to be and when you

3849
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:58,960
go out to compete

3850
02:18:56,558 --> 02:18:59,920
i've never seen any one school of

3851
02:18:58,959 --> 02:19:01,839
thought which

3852
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:04,558
gave noticeably better sports

3853
02:19:01,840 --> 02:19:06,719
performance than another

3854
02:19:04,558 --> 02:19:08,159
i've never seen any psychological

3855
02:19:06,718 --> 02:19:11,598
mindset

3856
02:19:08,159 --> 02:19:14,318
prove to be reliably more efficient

3857
02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:15,200
or effective than another i've seen

3858
02:19:14,318 --> 02:19:17,679
fighters that were

3859
02:19:15,200 --> 02:19:19,040
scared out of their minds when they went

3860
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:21,120
out every time to fight

3861
02:19:19,040 --> 02:19:22,479
and yet they were very successful i've

3862
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:24,319
seen fighters go out

3863
02:19:22,478 --> 02:19:25,599
who were relaxed and calm and they too

3864
02:19:24,318 --> 02:19:27,599
can be successful

3865
02:19:25,599 --> 02:19:29,040
i've seen both mindsets win i've seen

3866
02:19:27,599 --> 02:19:32,079
both mindsets lose

3867
02:19:29,040 --> 02:19:35,200
i've seen every extreme between them

3868
02:19:32,079 --> 02:19:37,840
what i generally recommend with regards

3869
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:38,960
your mind and preparation going in find

3870
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:41,000
what works for you

3871
02:19:38,959 --> 02:19:42,398
everyone's different don't try to give a

3872
02:19:41,000 --> 02:19:45,040
one-size-fits-all

3873
02:19:42,398 --> 02:19:46,840
in something as vague and confusing as

3874
02:19:45,040 --> 02:19:49,760
the human mind

3875
02:19:46,840 --> 02:19:52,960
um having said that

3876
02:19:49,760 --> 02:19:54,639
my preference i don't force it on people

3877
02:19:52,959 --> 02:19:55,599
because everyone's different but my

3878
02:19:54,639 --> 02:19:59,398
preference

3879
02:19:55,600 --> 02:20:01,840
is to try and advocate for a mindset of

3880
02:19:59,398 --> 02:20:04,239
unexceptionalism most people see

3881
02:20:01,840 --> 02:20:06,318
competition as something exceptional

3882
02:20:04,239 --> 02:20:07,600
it's not your everyday grappling session

3883
02:20:06,318 --> 02:20:10,000
you know you train

3884
02:20:07,600 --> 02:20:11,920
300 times for every time you compete and

3885
02:20:10,000 --> 02:20:14,398
so they see competition is something

3886
02:20:11,920 --> 02:20:15,840
exceptional different scarier more

3887
02:20:14,398 --> 02:20:17,279
nerve-wracking there's a crowd watching

3888
02:20:15,840 --> 02:20:18,880
these cameras

3889
02:20:17,280 --> 02:20:20,880
my reputation is on the line i'm going

3890
02:20:18,879 --> 02:20:22,719
to be observed and judged

3891
02:20:20,879 --> 02:20:25,119
and so they see it as this exceptional

3892
02:20:22,719 --> 02:20:27,358
event my general preference

3893
02:20:25,120 --> 02:20:29,520
is to see it as an unexceptional event

3894
02:20:27,359 --> 02:20:32,720
to see everything else

3895
02:20:29,520 --> 02:20:35,840
the noise the cameras the crowd

3896
02:20:32,719 --> 02:20:37,519
as illusions the only reality is a stage

3897
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:40,559
an opponent on the other side of it

3898
02:20:37,520 --> 02:20:41,280
and a referee adjudicating you and to

3899
02:20:40,559 --> 02:20:44,478
make it as

3900
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:46,239
unexceptional as possible gordon does an

3901
02:20:44,478 --> 02:20:49,599
extraordinarily good job

3902
02:20:46,239 --> 02:20:51,920
of of doing that gordon looks

3903
02:20:49,600 --> 02:20:52,960
more tense in most of his training

3904
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:54,000
sessions than he does in his

3905
02:20:52,959 --> 02:20:55,519
competitions

3906
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:57,439
because he knows his training partners

3907
02:20:55,520 --> 02:20:58,800
are typically better than the people

3908
02:20:57,439 --> 02:21:01,200
he's actually going out to compete

3909
02:20:58,799 --> 02:21:01,199
against

3910
02:21:01,520 --> 02:21:06,000
and you see it in its demeanor it's one

3911
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:08,159
of just complete calm

3912
02:21:06,000 --> 02:21:11,120
it also goes back to what we talked

3913
02:21:08,159 --> 02:21:12,799
about earlier about the power of escapes

3914
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:14,160
gordon ryan is almost impossible to

3915
02:21:12,799 --> 02:21:17,519
control for

3916
02:21:14,159 --> 02:21:19,359
extended periods of time in most of the

3917
02:21:17,520 --> 02:21:21,840
inferior positions in the sport

3918
02:21:19,359 --> 02:21:22,399
and most of the submissions so he goes

3919
02:21:21,840 --> 02:21:23,840
out

3920
02:21:22,398 --> 02:21:25,680
in the full knowledge that the worst

3921
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:28,079
case scenario

3922
02:21:25,680 --> 02:21:28,880
isn't that bad for him and so nothing

3923
02:21:28,079 --> 02:21:31,120
could really go

3924
02:21:28,879 --> 02:21:32,799
that badly wrong he can always recover

3925
02:21:31,120 --> 02:21:33,760
from any given mistake and go on to

3926
02:21:32,799 --> 02:21:35,599
victory

3927
02:21:33,760 --> 02:21:37,680
when you believe those things you can

3928
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:40,318
have a calm demeanor

3929
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:41,760
then if you look at somebody who is

3930
02:21:40,318 --> 02:21:45,039
quite a bit different than that

3931
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:46,719
george st pierre who at least in the way

3932
02:21:45,040 --> 02:21:49,920
he describes it

3933
02:21:46,719 --> 02:21:53,039
he's basically exceptionally anxious

3934
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:53,600
yes and terrified approaching a fight

3935
02:21:53,040 --> 02:21:56,880
ago

3936
02:21:53,600 --> 02:21:58,479
and he loves training and hates fighting

3937
02:21:56,879 --> 02:22:00,799
and hates fighting

3938
02:21:58,478 --> 02:22:02,478
so and just like you said he made it

3939
02:22:00,799 --> 02:22:05,358
work for him

3940
02:22:02,478 --> 02:22:07,039
but you he's somebody he speaks very

3941
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:10,479
highly of you he's worked with you

3942
02:22:07,040 --> 02:22:12,399
quite a bit in training

3943
02:22:10,478 --> 02:22:13,519
and you've studied him you've worked

3944
02:22:12,398 --> 02:22:16,159
with him

3945
02:22:13,520 --> 02:22:17,840
you've coached him interestingly i've

3946
02:22:16,159 --> 02:22:19,280
actually coached george for twice the

3947
02:22:17,840 --> 02:22:21,680
lengths of any of the

3948
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:23,439
squad members so my knowledge of

3949
02:22:21,680 --> 02:22:23,920
homelessness is far greater than it is

3950
02:22:23,439 --> 02:22:26,720
for

3951
02:22:23,920 --> 02:22:28,239
really a contemporary squad so can you

3952
02:22:26,719 --> 02:22:31,119
speak to what makes

3953
02:22:28,239 --> 02:22:31,840
george st pierre who i think even though

3954
02:22:31,120 --> 02:22:34,079
i'm russian

3955
02:22:31,840 --> 02:22:37,040
and a little bit partial towards fedor

3956
02:22:34,079 --> 02:22:39,439
and the the russians but i think he is

3957
02:22:37,040 --> 02:22:41,040
in the four categories you mentioned the

3958
02:22:39,439 --> 02:22:43,840
greatest mixed martial

3959
02:22:41,040 --> 02:22:44,880
artist of all time what makes him so

3960
02:22:43,840 --> 02:22:48,239
good

3961
02:22:44,879 --> 02:22:50,239
his approach his techniques his mind

3962
02:22:48,239 --> 02:22:52,799
his approach is certainly part of it

3963
02:22:50,239 --> 02:22:55,359
george started mixed martial arts at a

3964
02:22:52,799 --> 02:22:55,358
time when

3965
02:22:56,239 --> 02:23:02,959
the sport was in a pretty wild phase um

3966
02:23:00,000 --> 02:23:04,719
uh it was illegal to show on most

3967
02:23:02,959 --> 02:23:07,519
american tv networks

3968
02:23:04,719 --> 02:23:08,959
and there was talk about it being banned

3969
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:12,239
as a sport

3970
02:23:08,959 --> 02:23:14,000
uh in his native canada it was banned

3971
02:23:12,239 --> 02:23:16,159
you could only fight on indian

3972
02:23:14,000 --> 02:23:16,799
reservations and in canada i believe his

3973
02:23:16,159 --> 02:23:18,079
first

3974
02:23:16,799 --> 02:23:20,639
fight may have been on an indian

3975
02:23:18,079 --> 02:23:23,840
reservation um

3976
02:23:20,639 --> 02:23:26,879
so the sport at that stage

3977
02:23:23,840 --> 02:23:28,799
was very much in its infancy and

3978
02:23:26,879 --> 02:23:30,079
it's probably fair to say that most of

3979
02:23:28,799 --> 02:23:34,478
the athletes

3980
02:23:30,079 --> 02:23:34,478
involved in the sport came from

3981
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:38,720
a training program that would probably

3982
02:23:37,600 --> 02:23:41,840
be described as

3983
02:23:38,719 --> 02:23:44,879
unprofessional and in um

3984
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:48,079
in the contemporary scene

3985
02:23:44,879 --> 02:23:48,959
um george is one of a handful of people

3986
02:23:48,079 --> 02:23:50,398
who started

3987
02:23:48,959 --> 02:23:52,478
approaching the sport in a truly

3988
02:23:50,398 --> 02:23:54,000
professional fashion it was like okay

3989
02:23:52,478 --> 02:23:56,959
here's what great athletes in other

3990
02:23:54,000 --> 02:24:00,079
sports do i'm gonna try to emulate that

3991
02:23:56,959 --> 02:24:04,159
and uh

3992
02:24:00,079 --> 02:24:06,159
his ability to invest in himself

3993
02:24:04,159 --> 02:24:07,200
in my own experience for example uh

3994
02:24:06,159 --> 02:24:10,079
george

3995
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:11,920
when i first met him was a garbage man

3996
02:24:10,079 --> 02:24:15,039
and he would jump on a

3997
02:24:11,920 --> 02:24:16,879
bus from montreal to new york

3998
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:18,560
now that's a that's a long bus ride he

3999
02:24:16,879 --> 02:24:19,358
would come down on a friday afternoon

4000
02:24:18,559 --> 02:24:21,199
when he finished

4001
02:24:19,359 --> 02:24:22,880
work as a garbage man stay for the

4002
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:23,840
weekend and then late on sunday night he

4003
02:24:22,879 --> 02:24:25,279
would jump on a bus

4004
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:28,239
all the way back to montreal and work as

4005
02:24:25,280 --> 02:24:31,200
a garbage man um

4006
02:24:28,239 --> 02:24:32,719
that's an extraordinary commitment for a

4007
02:24:31,200 --> 02:24:36,479
young man

4008
02:24:32,719 --> 02:24:38,639
to make that's and

4009
02:24:36,478 --> 02:24:40,239
george was a blue belt at the time and

4010
02:24:38,639 --> 02:24:43,279
so he would come down and

4011
02:24:40,239 --> 02:24:45,359
you know we had a very talented room so

4012
02:24:43,280 --> 02:24:47,040
uh he didn't do well in the room when he

4013
02:24:45,359 --> 02:24:50,000
first came in he was inexperienced in

4014
02:24:47,040 --> 02:24:50,000
jiu-jitsu and uh

4015
02:24:50,639 --> 02:24:52,879
the people who went against were

4016
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:55,120
considerably better than him at

4017
02:24:52,879 --> 02:24:58,959
jiu-jitsu so imagine

4018
02:24:55,120 --> 02:25:00,880
investing 25 of your weekly income

4019
02:24:58,959 --> 02:25:03,039
maybe even more new york's an expensive

4020
02:25:00,879 --> 02:25:04,398
town 50 percent

4021
02:25:03,040 --> 02:25:06,640
to come down and just get your ass

4022
02:25:04,398 --> 02:25:10,639
kicked

4023
02:25:06,639 --> 02:25:10,639
months by month yeah that says a lot

4024
02:25:12,398 --> 02:25:16,159
let's talk about the whole idea of

4025
02:25:13,439 --> 02:25:17,520
delayed gratification here i mean um

4026
02:25:16,159 --> 02:25:19,920
that's that's a guy who's saying like

4027
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:22,079
this is highly unpleasant but i have a

4028
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:24,478
vision of myself in the future

4029
02:25:22,079 --> 02:25:26,398
and i have to go through this extreme

4030
02:25:24,478 --> 02:25:27,519
case of delayed gratification to get to

4031
02:25:26,398 --> 02:25:30,639
that distant goal

4032
02:25:27,520 --> 02:25:32,319
which may never happen and uh

4033
02:25:30,639 --> 02:25:33,680
that's a that's the level of commitment

4034
02:25:32,318 --> 02:25:34,959
and self-belief which is just

4035
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:37,040
extraordinary

4036
02:25:34,959 --> 02:25:38,719
um i always laugh when people say you

4037
02:25:37,040 --> 02:25:39,840
know george was afraid so he was

4038
02:25:38,719 --> 02:25:43,519
mentally weak

4039
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:46,318
like no that's that's a very

4040
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:48,000
very shallow understanding of mental

4041
02:25:46,318 --> 02:25:53,199
strength and weakness

4042
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:55,520
um george felt anxiety

4043
02:25:53,200 --> 02:25:56,960
but let's understand from the start

4044
02:25:55,520 --> 02:25:57,840
there's different kinds of mental

4045
02:25:56,959 --> 02:26:00,000
strength

4046
02:25:57,840 --> 02:26:01,120
and the most important kind isn't

4047
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:02,879
whether you feel

4048
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:04,960
fear or don't feel fear before you step

4049
02:26:02,879 --> 02:26:07,199
into fight the most important form of

4050
02:26:04,959 --> 02:26:10,079
mental strength

4051
02:26:07,200 --> 02:26:11,520
is discipline and training that's where

4052
02:26:10,079 --> 02:26:14,079
most people break

4053
02:26:11,520 --> 02:26:15,120
i know dozens of people who are fearless

4054
02:26:14,079 --> 02:26:16,559
to fight

4055
02:26:15,120 --> 02:26:18,000
but you couldn't get them to come into

4056
02:26:16,559 --> 02:26:19,119
the gym for three months in a row and

4057
02:26:18,000 --> 02:26:21,280
work on skills

4058
02:26:19,120 --> 02:26:22,560
yeah so they're mentally strong one way

4059
02:26:21,280 --> 02:26:24,239
they don't feel fear

4060
02:26:22,559 --> 02:26:26,159
but they're mentally weak in another

4061
02:26:24,239 --> 02:26:28,159
which is to instill them the discipline

4062
02:26:26,159 --> 02:26:29,039
which keeps you on a road to progress

4063
02:26:28,159 --> 02:26:31,039
over time

4064
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:33,120
that's much tougher than not feeling

4065
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:34,800
fear before you are defined

4066
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:36,240
understand also that when george talks

4067
02:26:34,799 --> 02:26:39,279
about fear

4068
02:26:36,239 --> 02:26:42,318
he's not afraid of his opponent he's

4069
02:26:39,280 --> 02:26:42,319
afraid of failure

4070
02:26:42,959 --> 02:26:47,759
he's got high standards someone who's

4071
02:26:46,159 --> 02:26:51,600
got high standards

4072
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:52,719
can change the world his standards were

4073
02:26:51,600 --> 02:26:54,399
very very high

4074
02:26:52,719 --> 02:26:56,559
that's what he was afraid of wasn't

4075
02:26:54,398 --> 02:26:57,920
afraid of his opponent

4076
02:26:56,559 --> 02:26:59,680
and yet that's always been the

4077
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:01,200
misinterpretation he wasn't mentally

4078
02:26:59,680 --> 02:27:05,040
weak he was mentally strong as an

4079
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:07,359
ox okay to stay in his

4080
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:08,240
training regimen year after year after

4081
02:27:07,359 --> 02:27:10,000
year

4082
02:27:08,239 --> 02:27:11,600
and do so while he became one of the

4083
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:13,680
first stars in mixed martial arts to

4084
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:15,680
actually make money

4085
02:27:13,680 --> 02:27:17,200
and it gets tough to stay in the

4086
02:27:15,680 --> 02:27:17,600
training gym with people who are young

4087
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:19,600
and

4088
02:27:17,600 --> 02:27:21,600
hungry and want to punch you in the face

4089
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:23,760
you're coming out of a luxury room

4090
02:27:21,600 --> 02:27:25,760
living in finery towards the end of his

4091
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:28,398
career and still training as hard as

4092
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:30,318
ever that's an impressive thing

4093
02:27:28,398 --> 02:27:32,000
and always he valued perfection and

4094
02:27:30,318 --> 02:27:33,600
you're right that was

4095
02:27:32,000 --> 02:27:36,159
the fear was not achieving the

4096
02:27:33,600 --> 02:27:36,159
perfection

4097
02:27:37,040 --> 02:27:42,840
is there something you've uh observed

4098
02:27:39,680 --> 02:27:44,960
about the way he approaches

4099
02:27:42,840 --> 02:27:47,120
training that uh

4100
02:27:44,959 --> 02:27:48,239
stands out to you or is it simply the

4101
02:27:47,120 --> 02:27:50,079
dedication no

4102
02:27:48,239 --> 02:27:51,520
it's never just about dedication there's

4103
02:27:50,079 --> 02:27:54,879
lots of dedicated people in the world

4104
02:27:51,520 --> 02:27:54,880
but most of them are unsuccessful

4105
02:27:56,719 --> 02:28:01,840
if you want to be the best in the world

4106
02:27:59,439 --> 02:28:04,800
at anything

4107
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:06,079
you have to do out of the many skills of

4108
02:28:04,799 --> 02:28:09,519
whatever

4109
02:28:06,079 --> 02:28:10,000
industry you're in you have to take at

4110
02:28:09,520 --> 02:28:14,000
least

4111
02:28:10,000 --> 02:28:16,799
one of those skills and be the best in

4112
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:16,799
the world at it

4113
02:28:18,079 --> 02:28:21,680
there's many skills in mixed martial

4114
02:28:19,840 --> 02:28:24,799
arts

4115
02:28:21,680 --> 02:28:27,680
but george identified one skill

4116
02:28:24,799 --> 02:28:31,358
which is the skill of striking to take

4117
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:31,359
downs he calls it shoot boxing

4118
02:28:32,879 --> 02:28:38,478
shoot boxing was barely even a

4119
02:28:36,639 --> 02:28:40,239
category of skill when george began it

4120
02:28:38,478 --> 02:28:42,000
was just the idea that wrestlers

4121
02:28:40,239 --> 02:28:44,000
grabbed people and took them down the

4122
02:28:42,000 --> 02:28:47,200
same way they did in wrestling and

4123
02:28:44,000 --> 02:28:48,398
and you threw some punches before you

4124
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:51,120
did it

4125
02:28:48,398 --> 02:28:51,119
okay george

4126
02:28:52,318 --> 02:28:59,119
largely pioneered this science

4127
02:28:56,879 --> 02:29:02,239
of creating an interface between

4128
02:28:59,120 --> 02:29:06,560
striking and takedowns

4129
02:29:02,239 --> 02:29:08,719
he did it at a time where

4130
02:29:06,559 --> 02:29:11,600
no one else before him had made it into

4131
02:29:08,719 --> 02:29:16,799
a system or a science

4132
02:29:11,600 --> 02:29:16,800
he did it largely on his own and

4133
02:29:18,719 --> 02:29:22,318
i've always said george is the only

4134
02:29:20,559 --> 02:29:22,719
athlete that i ever coached who taught

4135
02:29:22,318 --> 02:29:27,760
me

4136
02:29:22,719 --> 02:29:27,760
more than i taught him and

4137
02:29:29,520 --> 02:29:36,720
almost single-handedly he created this

4138
02:29:33,159 --> 02:29:37,760
strong sense of shoot boxing as a

4139
02:29:36,719 --> 02:29:41,119
science

4140
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:43,680
which enabled him throughout his career

4141
02:29:41,120 --> 02:29:44,399
to determine where the fight would take

4142
02:29:43,680 --> 02:29:46,318
place

4143
02:29:44,398 --> 02:29:48,239
would it be standing or would it be on

4144
02:29:46,318 --> 02:29:50,159
the ground and that

4145
02:29:48,239 --> 02:29:52,478
more than anything else was the defining

4146
02:29:50,159 --> 02:29:56,799
characteristic of his success

4147
02:29:52,478 --> 02:29:58,478
um i will always be

4148
02:29:56,799 --> 02:30:00,559
immensely impressed by his

4149
02:29:58,478 --> 02:30:03,519
accomplishment in that regard he was an

4150
02:30:00,559 --> 02:30:05,119
innovator he did things differently this

4151
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:08,159
is such an important point

4152
02:30:05,120 --> 02:30:10,240
you can't go out there in combat sports

4153
02:30:08,159 --> 02:30:11,280
and do the same things that everybody

4154
02:30:10,239 --> 02:30:14,559
else is doing

4155
02:30:11,280 --> 02:30:16,960
and expect to get different results

4156
02:30:14,559 --> 02:30:18,000
life doesn't work that way if you want

4157
02:30:16,959 --> 02:30:20,079
to be dominant

4158
02:30:18,000 --> 02:30:22,559
you got to find one important part of

4159
02:30:20,079 --> 02:30:24,639
the sport and preferably more than one

4160
02:30:22,559 --> 02:30:26,478
and be the best in the world at it you

4161
02:30:24,639 --> 02:30:28,000
can't be weak at anything

4162
02:30:26,478 --> 02:30:29,760
but you can't be strong at everything

4163
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,559
either life's not long enough for us to

4164
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:32,800
develop a

4165
02:30:30,559 --> 02:30:33,920
truly complete skill set so you've got

4166
02:30:32,799 --> 02:30:35,199
to be good at everything

4167
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:38,000
and you've got to be the best at at

4168
02:30:35,200 --> 02:30:41,520
least one thing and george was the best

4169
02:30:38,000 --> 02:30:43,760
at two in his era he was the best at

4170
02:30:41,520 --> 02:30:45,120
striking to take downs and he was the

4171
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:48,639
best at integrating

4172
02:30:45,120 --> 02:30:48,640
striking and grappling on the floor

4173
02:30:49,120 --> 02:30:52,319
let me ask you a completely ridiculous

4174
02:30:51,200 --> 02:30:54,960
question

4175
02:30:52,318 --> 02:30:56,398
but it's a fascinating one for me from

4176
02:30:54,959 --> 02:30:58,398
an engineering and a scientific

4177
02:30:56,398 --> 02:31:01,039
perspective

4178
02:30:58,398 --> 02:31:02,639
when i look at a sport really any

4179
02:31:01,040 --> 02:31:05,920
problem

4180
02:31:02,639 --> 02:31:07,840
one way to ask how difficult is this

4181
02:31:05,920 --> 02:31:10,879
problem

4182
02:31:07,840 --> 02:31:12,719
is to see how can i build a machine

4183
02:31:10,879 --> 02:31:14,879
that competes with a human being at that

4184
02:31:12,719 --> 02:31:19,119
problem you can look at chess

4185
02:31:14,879 --> 02:31:19,119
you could look at soccer robocup

4186
02:31:20,239 --> 02:31:24,318
and then you could look at grappling

4187
02:31:22,719 --> 02:31:25,599
there's something about when you start

4188
02:31:24,318 --> 02:31:28,799
to think

4189
02:31:25,600 --> 02:31:29,760
how would i build an ai system a robot

4190
02:31:28,799 --> 02:31:32,478
that defeats

4191
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:34,318
somebody like gordon ryan where it

4192
02:31:32,478 --> 02:31:38,639
forces you to really think

4193
02:31:34,318 --> 02:31:41,760
about formalizing this art

4194
02:31:38,639 --> 02:31:42,000
as a as an engineering discipline in the

4195
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:44,559
same

4196
02:31:42,000 --> 02:31:46,478
way you do but you you you still have

4197
02:31:44,559 --> 02:31:48,239
some art injected in there

4198
02:31:46,478 --> 02:31:49,679
there's no space for art when you

4199
02:31:48,239 --> 02:31:51,280
actually have to build the system that's

4200
02:31:49,680 --> 02:31:52,720
not a ridiculous question that's a

4201
02:31:51,280 --> 02:31:55,200
damned interesting question

4202
02:31:52,719 --> 02:31:57,199
let's put aside the like like i

4203
02:31:55,200 --> 02:31:57,920
mentioned with the boston dynamics spot

4204
02:31:57,200 --> 02:32:00,399
robots

4205
02:31:57,920 --> 02:32:01,200
what people don't realize is the amount

4206
02:32:00,398 --> 02:32:03,279
of power

4207
02:32:01,200 --> 02:32:04,880
they can deliver is huge so let's take

4208
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:06,960
that weapon aside

4209
02:32:04,879 --> 02:32:08,318
just the amount of force you're able to

4210
02:32:06,959 --> 02:32:11,358
deliver yeah yeah

4211
02:32:08,318 --> 02:32:14,959
i'm glad you're specifying that um uh

4212
02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:16,880
so essentially your question is okay can

4213
02:32:14,959 --> 02:32:19,039
can a talented group of engineers create

4214
02:32:16,879 --> 02:32:22,559
a robot which could defeat gordon ryan

4215
02:32:19,040 --> 02:32:23,920
on the face of it um as you just pointed

4216
02:32:22,559 --> 02:32:24,559
out that's the easiest project in the

4217
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:26,079
world

4218
02:32:24,559 --> 02:32:27,680
just create a robot that carries a nine

4219
02:32:26,079 --> 02:32:28,879
millimeter automatic and shoot them five

4220
02:32:27,680 --> 02:32:30,000
times in the chest okay that's that

4221
02:32:28,879 --> 02:32:31,599
gordon ryan's done

4222
02:32:30,000 --> 02:32:33,680
um so that's not the interesting

4223
02:32:31,600 --> 02:32:36,640
question the interesting question

4224
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:38,960
and i if i understand you correctly is

4225
02:32:36,639 --> 02:32:42,879
if we had the ability

4226
02:32:38,959 --> 02:32:44,079
to create a robot whose physical powers

4227
02:32:42,879 --> 02:32:46,398
were identical

4228
02:32:44,079 --> 02:32:48,159
to gordon ryan not inferior and not

4229
02:32:46,398 --> 02:32:50,318
superior

4230
02:32:48,159 --> 02:32:52,159
what would it take to create a mind

4231
02:32:50,318 --> 02:32:54,079
inside that robot that would be gordon

4232
02:32:52,159 --> 02:32:56,719
ryan in the majority of matches yeah

4233
02:32:54,079 --> 02:32:58,239
and there's two ways to build ai systems

4234
02:32:56,719 --> 02:33:01,199
this is true for autonomous

4235
02:32:58,239 --> 02:33:02,318
driving for example which has been quite

4236
02:33:01,200 --> 02:33:05,520
contested

4237
02:33:02,318 --> 02:33:06,079
recently so one is you basically one way

4238
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:09,200
to describe

4239
02:33:06,079 --> 02:33:11,840
is you have a giant set of rules

4240
02:33:09,200 --> 02:33:13,280
it's like this tree of rules where you

4241
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:14,239
apply a different condition when there's

4242
02:33:13,280 --> 02:33:16,479
a pattern you see

4243
02:33:14,239 --> 02:33:18,079
you apply a rule and they're hard coded

4244
02:33:16,478 --> 02:33:20,799
in you basically get

4245
02:33:18,079 --> 02:33:21,520
like a john donner type of character who

4246
02:33:20,799 --> 02:33:24,799
tries to

4247
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:27,359
encode hard code

4248
02:33:24,799 --> 02:33:28,719
into the system all the moves you should

4249
02:33:27,359 --> 02:33:31,359
do in every single

4250
02:33:28,719 --> 02:33:32,398
case of course you can't actually do

4251
02:33:31,359 --> 02:33:34,640
that fully

4252
02:33:32,398 --> 02:33:36,799
so you're going to be taking shortcuts

4253
02:33:34,639 --> 02:33:41,039
uh what are called heuristics

4254
02:33:36,799 --> 02:33:43,920
just basic basic kind of generalizations

4255
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:45,040
and apply your own expertise as an

4256
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:47,680
expert of

4257
02:33:45,040 --> 02:33:49,040
in this case grappling to see how that

4258
02:33:47,680 --> 02:33:51,439
can be encoded as a rule

4259
02:33:49,040 --> 02:33:53,120
now the other approach elon musk and

4260
02:33:51,439 --> 02:33:55,680
tesla taking this approach

4261
02:33:53,120 --> 02:33:57,920
which is called machine learning which

4262
02:33:55,680 --> 02:33:57,920
is

4263
02:34:00,079 --> 02:34:05,200
create a basic framework of the kind of

4264
02:34:02,639 --> 02:34:08,079
things you should be observing

4265
02:34:05,200 --> 02:34:09,600
and what are the measures metrics of

4266
02:34:08,079 --> 02:34:12,398
success

4267
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:13,840
and then just observe and see which

4268
02:34:12,398 --> 02:34:15,358
things lead to success

4269
02:34:13,840 --> 02:34:17,439
more success and which lead to less

4270
02:34:15,359 --> 02:34:20,559
success and there's a delta

4271
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:22,239
you like when you when you see a thing

4272
02:34:20,559 --> 02:34:23,680
first of all the way machine learning

4273
02:34:22,239 --> 02:34:25,680
works is you predict

4274
02:34:23,680 --> 02:34:26,720
you see a position or you see a

4275
02:34:25,680 --> 02:34:28,880
situation

4276
02:34:26,719 --> 02:34:29,760
and then you predict how good that is

4277
02:34:28,879 --> 02:34:32,639
and then you watch

4278
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:34,159
how it actually turns out and if it's uh

4279
02:34:32,639 --> 02:34:35,199
worse or better you adjust your

4280
02:34:34,159 --> 02:34:38,318
expectations yes

4281
02:34:35,200 --> 02:34:39,920
through that process you can learn quite

4282
02:34:38,318 --> 02:34:42,959
a lot

4283
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:44,960
the the challenges

4284
02:34:42,959 --> 02:34:46,799
and this might be a very true challenge

4285
02:34:44,959 --> 02:34:50,239
in grappling

4286
02:34:46,799 --> 02:34:53,438
is uh in like in driving

4287
02:34:50,239 --> 02:34:56,398
you can't crash so

4288
02:34:53,439 --> 02:34:58,159
there's a physical world in chess for

4289
02:34:56,398 --> 02:34:59,760
example where this

4290
02:34:58,159 --> 02:35:02,719
approach has been exceptionally

4291
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:03,439
successful you can work in simulation so

4292
02:35:02,719 --> 02:35:07,119
you can have

4293
02:35:03,439 --> 02:35:09,600
a ai system that for example

4294
02:35:07,120 --> 02:35:11,760
with as in the case with alpha zero by

4295
02:35:09,600 --> 02:35:14,079
deepmind google's demand

4296
02:35:11,760 --> 02:35:16,960
it can play itself in simulation

4297
02:35:14,079 --> 02:35:19,359
millions of times billions of times

4298
02:35:16,959 --> 02:35:20,000
it's difficult to know if it's possible

4299
02:35:19,359 --> 02:35:23,280
to do that

4300
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:25,280
in stimulation for for for anything that

4301
02:35:23,280 --> 02:35:30,399
involves human movement

4302
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:33,439
like grappling so that's

4303
02:35:30,398 --> 02:35:36,639
my sense is if we first look at the

4304
02:35:33,439 --> 02:35:39,600
hard encoding if you were to try to

4305
02:35:36,639 --> 02:35:39,920
describe gordon ryan to a machine how

4306
02:35:39,600 --> 02:35:42,479
many

4307
02:35:39,920 --> 02:35:43,200
rules are in there do you think yeah um

4308
02:35:42,478 --> 02:35:44,639
first off

4309
02:35:43,200 --> 02:35:46,000
let me tell you that's one of the most

4310
02:35:44,639 --> 02:35:46,398
fascinating questions i've ever been

4311
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:49,760
asked

4312
02:35:46,398 --> 02:35:50,318
and uh i'm tremendously happy to answer

4313
02:35:49,760 --> 02:35:53,280
this

4314
02:35:50,318 --> 02:35:55,279
um how about what we do is this is a

4315
02:35:53,280 --> 02:35:55,840
this is a massive question you've asked

4316
02:35:55,280 --> 02:35:57,680
there's a

4317
02:35:55,840 --> 02:35:59,439
huge amount of ways this could get very

4318
02:35:57,680 --> 02:36:02,318
interesting and very confusing

4319
02:35:59,439 --> 02:36:03,040
let's set some ground rules for the

4320
02:36:02,318 --> 02:36:06,879
discussion

4321
02:36:03,040 --> 02:36:10,319
um uh lex alluded to

4322
02:36:06,879 --> 02:36:12,318
the idea of man versus machine and

4323
02:36:10,318 --> 02:36:13,760
chess okay and i think that's a really

4324
02:36:12,318 --> 02:36:17,439
good place for us to start

4325
02:36:13,760 --> 02:36:20,000
the the discussion um i'm going to

4326
02:36:17,439 --> 02:36:20,800
uh just tell people about a little bit

4327
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:23,120
the history of

4328
02:36:20,799 --> 02:36:23,920
man versus chess to give you guys some

4329
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:26,479
uh

4330
02:36:23,920 --> 02:36:26,960
some background on this in 1968 there

4331
02:36:26,478 --> 02:36:29,760
was a

4332
02:36:26,959 --> 02:36:31,119
a party in which a highly ranked not not

4333
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:33,200
a world champion but a highly ranked

4334
02:36:31,120 --> 02:36:36,560
chess player and his name was levy

4335
02:36:33,200 --> 02:36:40,240
and he met a

4336
02:36:36,559 --> 02:36:43,519
a computer engineer at a party

4337
02:36:40,239 --> 02:36:43,520
and they had a a

4338
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:48,318
a light-hearted bet that in a 10-year

4339
02:36:46,879 --> 02:36:51,759
time frame

4340
02:36:48,318 --> 02:36:54,639
a human chess player would be defeated

4341
02:36:51,760 --> 02:36:56,719
by a computer now you gotta remember

4342
02:36:54,639 --> 02:36:58,879
1968 computing power was

4343
02:36:56,719 --> 02:37:01,358
very very low the computers that got

4344
02:36:58,879 --> 02:37:02,959
america to the moon were

4345
02:37:01,359 --> 02:37:06,079
were actually pretty damn primitive your

4346
02:37:02,959 --> 02:37:08,000
iphone would kick all of their asses

4347
02:37:06,079 --> 02:37:09,359
so computational power was very very low

4348
02:37:08,000 --> 02:37:12,239
in those days

4349
02:37:09,359 --> 02:37:13,760
so interestingly the chess player fully

4350
02:37:12,239 --> 02:37:15,280
believed that no computer could beat

4351
02:37:13,760 --> 02:37:17,760
them in the 10-year time frame

4352
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:19,840
and the the computer engineer was very

4353
02:37:17,760 --> 02:37:23,439
optimistic that he was wrong and

4354
02:37:19,840 --> 02:37:24,159
in fact 10 years uh the computer would

4355
02:37:23,439 --> 02:37:26,079
win

4356
02:37:24,159 --> 02:37:27,760
10 years later they had a competition

4357
02:37:26,079 --> 02:37:30,799
and the human won

4358
02:37:27,760 --> 02:37:33,680
uh decisively in fact so

4359
02:37:30,799 --> 02:37:35,279
computational power simply hadn't risen

4360
02:37:33,680 --> 02:37:37,760
to that level yet

4361
02:37:35,280 --> 02:37:38,640
through the 1980s computational power

4362
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:42,398
increased

4363
02:37:38,639 --> 02:37:43,760
but not sufficient to to to get to

4364
02:37:42,398 --> 02:37:45,119
championship level

4365
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:48,318
there were computer programs in the

4366
02:37:45,120 --> 02:37:50,399
1980s which were competitive with

4367
02:37:48,318 --> 02:37:52,799
good solid chess players but not world

4368
02:37:50,398 --> 02:37:52,799
beaters

4369
02:37:54,639 --> 02:38:00,478
understand right from the start that

4370
02:37:57,920 --> 02:38:04,159
there's a fundamental problem here

4371
02:38:00,478 --> 02:38:06,478
the number of options

4372
02:38:04,159 --> 02:38:08,398
that the two players in a chess board

4373
02:38:06,478 --> 02:38:12,239
can run through

4374
02:38:08,398 --> 02:38:14,318
is astronomically high there are 64

4375
02:38:12,239 --> 02:38:18,079
squares on a chess chessboard

4376
02:38:14,318 --> 02:38:20,959
the number of possible options that can

4377
02:38:18,079 --> 02:38:22,239
could work or could play out on a

4378
02:38:20,959 --> 02:38:24,079
chessboard

4379
02:38:22,239 --> 02:38:25,840
and this is a truly shocking thing for

4380
02:38:24,079 --> 02:38:29,280
you to think about

4381
02:38:25,840 --> 02:38:33,040
the number of possible options is higher

4382
02:38:29,280 --> 02:38:36,079
than the number of atoms in the known

4383
02:38:33,040 --> 02:38:38,800
universe think about that for a second

4384
02:38:36,079 --> 02:38:40,000
in terms of complexity okay the number

4385
02:38:38,799 --> 02:38:43,358
of atoms on this

4386
02:38:40,000 --> 02:38:46,639
table is massive

4387
02:38:43,359 --> 02:38:48,318
okay that is an unbelievably large

4388
02:38:46,639 --> 02:38:49,760
number

4389
02:38:48,318 --> 02:38:51,920
then we're talking about a situation

4390
02:38:49,760 --> 02:38:53,760
where if a computer had to go through

4391
02:38:51,920 --> 02:38:55,280
all the options at the onset of a match

4392
02:38:53,760 --> 02:38:58,478
they would have to

4393
02:38:55,280 --> 02:39:00,720
run numbers greater than the number of

4394
02:38:58,478 --> 02:39:03,199
atoms in the known universe the number

4395
02:39:00,719 --> 02:39:05,599
of galaxies and the number of

4396
02:39:03,200 --> 02:39:07,439
in our universe is vast okay it's

4397
02:39:05,600 --> 02:39:09,120
measured in the billions like the number

4398
02:39:07,439 --> 02:39:11,040
of atoms that's just

4399
02:39:09,120 --> 02:39:14,000
a number so mind blown it's impossible

4400
02:39:11,040 --> 02:39:17,040
okay so

4401
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:18,639
no computer is ever going to be able to

4402
02:39:17,040 --> 02:39:20,800
work with those kinds of numbers

4403
02:39:18,639 --> 02:39:22,559
okay you that i don't even know if

4404
02:39:20,799 --> 02:39:24,079
future generations of quantum computers

4405
02:39:22,559 --> 02:39:25,439
could could work it with those kind of

4406
02:39:24,079 --> 02:39:27,760
numbers so that's the fundamental

4407
02:39:25,439 --> 02:39:29,760
problem okay the number of options in a

4408
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:32,478
in a chess match is just so

4409
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:33,680
astronomically large that no computer

4410
02:39:32,478 --> 02:39:36,159
could ever

4411
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:37,840
figure out all the the available options

4412
02:39:36,159 --> 02:39:38,398
and make decisions in a given time frame

4413
02:39:37,840 --> 02:39:41,520
so that's

4414
02:39:38,398 --> 02:39:44,000
the fundamental problem so as lex

4415
02:39:41,520 --> 02:39:44,720
correctly pointed out the way you get

4416
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:47,200
around this

4417
02:39:44,719 --> 02:39:48,879
is by the use of heuristics these are

4418
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:51,600
rules of thumb

4419
02:39:48,879 --> 02:39:53,358
which give general guidelines to action

4420
02:39:51,600 --> 02:39:54,800
so for example in jiu-jitsu i could give

4421
02:39:53,359 --> 02:39:57,600
you a general rule of thumb

4422
02:39:54,799 --> 02:39:59,199
uh don't turn your back on your opponent

4423
02:39:57,600 --> 02:40:00,559
okay that's a solid piece of advice

4424
02:39:59,200 --> 02:40:01,200
there are obviously some exceptions to

4425
02:40:00,559 --> 02:40:02,959
that rule

4426
02:40:01,200 --> 02:40:04,960
but it's a good solid piece of advice to

4427
02:40:02,959 --> 02:40:06,398
give a beginner the moment you give that

4428
02:40:04,959 --> 02:40:09,199
heuristic rule

4429
02:40:06,398 --> 02:40:10,879
you rule out a lot of options okay

4430
02:40:09,200 --> 02:40:11,920
you've already told someone don't turn

4431
02:40:10,879 --> 02:40:12,478
your back don't turn your back on

4432
02:40:11,920 --> 02:40:14,799
someone

4433
02:40:12,478 --> 02:40:16,159
so a lot of possibilities have just been

4434
02:40:14,799 --> 02:40:17,599
turned away right there

4435
02:40:16,159 --> 02:40:19,439
so you've cut the number of options in

4436
02:40:17,600 --> 02:40:20,000
half right there just by giving one

4437
02:40:19,439 --> 02:40:23,600
heuristic

4438
02:40:20,000 --> 02:40:25,760
rule okay if you

4439
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:28,399
were decent at j it's not great but

4440
02:40:25,760 --> 02:40:31,520
decent and you knew enough to give say

4441
02:40:28,398 --> 02:40:33,760
10 heuristic rules you could chop

4442
02:40:31,520 --> 02:40:34,720
that initially vast number of options

4443
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:37,439
down

4444
02:40:34,719 --> 02:40:38,959
by a vast amount and now you're starting

4445
02:40:37,439 --> 02:40:40,239
to get to a point where if the computer

4446
02:40:38,959 --> 02:40:42,398
had sufficient

4447
02:40:40,239 --> 02:40:43,439
computational power it could start

4448
02:40:42,398 --> 02:40:46,000
getting through

4449
02:40:43,439 --> 02:40:47,200
the number of options in that acceptable

4450
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:50,318
time frame so that's

4451
02:40:47,200 --> 02:40:51,520
the general pattern of the development

4452
02:40:50,318 --> 02:40:54,318
now things started getting very

4453
02:40:51,520 --> 02:40:58,239
interesting in the mid 1990s

4454
02:40:54,318 --> 02:40:58,239
with ibm's computer deep blue

4455
02:40:58,478 --> 02:41:02,639
there was a great chess champion of the

4456
02:41:00,478 --> 02:41:05,278
late 1980s and early 19

4457
02:41:02,639 --> 02:41:05,760
through the 1990s called gary kasparov

4458
02:41:05,279 --> 02:41:07,760
who

4459
02:41:05,760 --> 02:41:11,359
had been more or less undefeated for a

4460
02:41:07,760 --> 02:41:13,040
decade in 1996 he took on ibm's computer

4461
02:41:11,359 --> 02:41:15,359
deep blue

4462
02:41:13,040 --> 02:41:17,840
just to correct the record he was

4463
02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:17,840
undefeated

4464
02:41:18,318 --> 02:41:21,439
i apologize russian got it gotta make

4465
02:41:20,079 --> 02:41:23,279
sure they get very nationalistic about

4466
02:41:21,439 --> 02:41:25,680
their chairs be careful of these guys

4467
02:41:23,279 --> 02:41:27,840
deep blue lost the first confrontation i

4468
02:41:25,680 --> 02:41:28,479
believe in 1996 it was competitive but

4469
02:41:27,840 --> 02:41:32,239
lost

4470
02:41:28,478 --> 02:41:35,519
then in 1997 uh deep blue

4471
02:41:32,239 --> 02:41:37,039
won and it wasn't a complete walkover

4472
02:41:35,520 --> 02:41:38,880
kasparov i believe won one of the

4473
02:41:37,040 --> 02:41:42,000
matches but uh

4474
02:41:38,879 --> 02:41:43,358
they did unequiv er deeply unequivocally

4475
02:41:42,000 --> 02:41:45,120
won the confrontation

4476
02:41:43,359 --> 02:41:46,960
and it was seen as like this watershed

4477
02:41:45,120 --> 02:41:49,520
moment where

4478
02:41:46,959 --> 02:41:50,799
a computer beat the best human chess

4479
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:52,560
player on the planet

4480
02:41:50,799 --> 02:41:54,398
and that was it there was there's no

4481
02:41:52,559 --> 02:41:56,559
coming back from that

4482
02:41:54,398 --> 02:41:58,000
i think it would be remembered as one of

4483
02:41:56,559 --> 02:42:00,719
the biggest moments in computing

4484
02:41:58,000 --> 02:42:02,559
history is is really when the first time

4485
02:42:00,719 --> 02:42:04,000
a machine beat a human at a thing that

4486
02:42:02,559 --> 02:42:05,840
humans really care about

4487
02:42:04,000 --> 02:42:08,000
in the in the domain of intellectual

4488
02:42:05,840 --> 02:42:11,680
pursuits yeah it was it was a

4489
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:13,760
it was a powerful powerful moment now

4490
02:42:11,680 --> 02:42:15,600
not only was that a powerful moment but

4491
02:42:13,760 --> 02:42:16,960
things started getting truly interesting

4492
02:42:15,600 --> 02:42:18,000
from that moment forward

4493
02:42:16,959 --> 02:42:21,759
because then you started having

4494
02:42:18,000 --> 02:42:21,760
different areas of development

4495
02:42:25,680 --> 02:42:31,359
the general way in which

4496
02:42:28,719 --> 02:42:34,239
the progress is made from those early

4497
02:42:31,359 --> 02:42:35,760
starts in 1968

4498
02:42:34,239 --> 02:42:37,359
all the way through to deep blues

4499
02:42:35,760 --> 02:42:39,600
victory was

4500
02:42:37,359 --> 02:42:40,800
of the use of heuristic rules that

4501
02:42:39,600 --> 02:42:43,120
brought down

4502
02:42:40,799 --> 02:42:44,239
the number of potential options to a

4503
02:42:43,120 --> 02:42:46,720
manageable level

4504
02:42:44,239 --> 02:42:47,279
as computer power increased then it

4505
02:42:46,719 --> 02:42:49,278
could make

4506
02:42:47,279 --> 02:42:51,040
faster and faster and wiser and wiser

4507
02:42:49,279 --> 02:42:52,880
decisions and

4508
02:42:51,040 --> 02:42:54,560
make them at a rate which no human even

4509
02:42:52,879 --> 02:42:56,000
the best human could keep up with so

4510
02:42:54,559 --> 02:42:59,119
that was the general

4511
02:42:56,000 --> 02:43:02,398
way in which the the debate went

4512
02:42:59,120 --> 02:43:06,479
um but things got more interesting

4513
02:43:02,398 --> 02:43:08,559
after this with the advent of

4514
02:43:06,478 --> 02:43:12,398
computers that as you pointed out make

4515
02:43:08,559 --> 02:43:12,398
use of so-called machine learning

4516
02:43:12,879 --> 02:43:20,239
there were a company put out

4517
02:43:16,398 --> 02:43:23,760
uh a program alpha zero

4518
02:43:20,239 --> 02:43:24,559
which can look at the basic rule

4519
02:43:23,760 --> 02:43:27,840
structures

4520
02:43:24,559 --> 02:43:30,239
of chess and then ultimately play itself

4521
02:43:27,840 --> 02:43:31,680
in trial games and make trial and error

4522
02:43:30,239 --> 02:43:32,719
assessment of what are good and bad

4523
02:43:31,680 --> 02:43:36,079
strategies

4524
02:43:32,719 --> 02:43:37,920
so that with no human intervention a

4525
02:43:36,079 --> 02:43:40,318
computer could start doing remarkable

4526
02:43:37,920 --> 02:43:40,318
things

4527
02:43:40,719 --> 02:43:46,799
not only did uh

4528
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:48,079
this company create alpha zero and there

4529
02:43:46,799 --> 02:43:50,000
were some other ones too that they

4530
02:43:48,079 --> 02:43:53,520
fought not only in chess but in the much

4531
02:43:50,000 --> 02:43:57,200
more complex asian game of go

4532
02:43:53,520 --> 02:43:59,359
which has far more potential options

4533
02:43:57,200 --> 02:44:01,840
than chester by a very significant

4534
02:43:59,359 --> 02:44:05,680
margin yes

4535
02:44:01,840 --> 02:44:08,398
these machine learning programs not only

4536
02:44:05,680 --> 02:44:08,800
easily defeat any human in chess but in

4537
02:44:08,398 --> 02:44:12,398
go

4538
02:44:08,799 --> 02:44:14,799
as well and what's truly remarkable is

4539
02:44:12,398 --> 02:44:17,760
they weren't just beating them

4540
02:44:14,799 --> 02:44:19,679
when alpha zero took on a rival chess

4541
02:44:17,760 --> 02:44:22,559
program which by itself was already

4542
02:44:19,680 --> 02:44:25,680
superior to any human

4543
02:44:22,559 --> 02:44:28,959
it only required four

4544
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:30,079
hours starting from learning the rules

4545
02:44:28,959 --> 02:44:32,559
of chess

4546
02:44:30,079 --> 02:44:35,120
to figuring out how to beat the second

4547
02:44:32,559 --> 02:44:38,398
most powerful chess program in the world

4548
02:44:35,120 --> 02:44:39,680
that's insane that's literally like

4549
02:44:38,398 --> 02:44:41,760
taking a human

4550
02:44:39,680 --> 02:44:43,520
telling the rules of chess they play

4551
02:44:41,760 --> 02:44:45,120
some games with themselves

4552
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:47,840
for four hours and they go out and beat

4553
02:44:45,120 --> 02:44:47,840
gary kasparov

4554
02:44:48,318 --> 02:44:54,159
this is like to me this is a

4555
02:44:52,000 --> 02:44:55,439
truly exciting development far beyond

4556
02:44:54,159 --> 02:44:56,719
even what deep blue did

4557
02:44:55,439 --> 02:44:58,398
i like how you said exciting not

4558
02:44:56,719 --> 02:44:59,840
terrifying yeah because i agree with you

4559
02:44:58,398 --> 02:45:01,680
on the exciting

4560
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:03,439
now things also get exciting in a

4561
02:45:01,680 --> 02:45:06,079
different direction

4562
02:45:03,439 --> 02:45:07,760
there is another possibility which few

4563
02:45:06,079 --> 02:45:10,478
people foresaw

4564
02:45:07,760 --> 02:45:11,120
after the deep blue episode this is

4565
02:45:10,478 --> 02:45:14,000
where

4566
02:45:11,120 --> 02:45:14,880
a new form of chess started to emerge

4567
02:45:14,000 --> 02:45:18,799
sometimes called

4568
02:45:14,879 --> 02:45:22,159
cyborg chess or centaur chess

4569
02:45:18,799 --> 02:45:23,278
we're humans of moderate chess level

4570
02:45:22,159 --> 02:45:25,680
playing ability

4571
02:45:23,279 --> 02:45:26,880
not world champions just decent but not

4572
02:45:25,680 --> 02:45:28,398
great

4573
02:45:26,879 --> 02:45:30,159
i guess you might say like purple belts

4574
02:45:28,398 --> 02:45:33,439
and juditson

4575
02:45:30,159 --> 02:45:36,159
allied themselves with computers

4576
02:45:33,439 --> 02:45:36,880
so the humans and computers worked as a

4577
02:45:36,159 --> 02:45:40,559
cyborg

4578
02:45:36,879 --> 02:45:43,920
team the humans supplied

4579
02:45:40,559 --> 02:45:47,039
the heuristic insight the computers

4580
02:45:43,920 --> 02:45:50,719
supplied the computational power

4581
02:45:47,040 --> 02:45:53,120
and fascinatingly they proved to be

4582
02:45:50,719 --> 02:45:56,478
superior to both the best humans

4583
02:45:53,120 --> 02:45:59,680
and the best chess programs

4584
02:45:56,478 --> 02:46:02,239
the united force of human insight

4585
02:45:59,680 --> 02:46:03,279
with heuristics with computers ability

4586
02:46:02,239 --> 02:46:06,000
to go through

4587
02:46:03,279 --> 02:46:07,920
uh numbers in far more rapid form than

4588
02:46:06,000 --> 02:46:09,359
any human could ever hope to do

4589
02:46:07,920 --> 02:46:12,478
proved to be one of the strongest

4590
02:46:09,359 --> 02:46:15,520
combinations and enabled

4591
02:46:12,478 --> 02:46:18,719
that pairing of human and computer

4592
02:46:15,520 --> 02:46:22,479
to overwhelm both the best single human

4593
02:46:18,719 --> 02:46:23,760
and the best single computer that adds a

4594
02:46:22,478 --> 02:46:27,599
whole new level

4595
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:30,478
of fascination to this topic so to

4596
02:46:27,600 --> 02:46:31,760
wind things up here we've got this

4597
02:46:30,478 --> 02:46:34,239
fascinating

4598
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:35,840
initial question from lex the idea of

4599
02:46:34,239 --> 02:46:39,439
could there be

4600
02:46:35,840 --> 02:46:42,478
a computer inside a robot

4601
02:46:39,439 --> 02:46:44,800
which doesn't have any special

4602
02:46:42,478 --> 02:46:46,559
physical properties this is mind versus

4603
02:46:44,799 --> 02:46:48,559
mind because the bodies negate each

4604
02:46:46,559 --> 02:46:49,840
other the robot is the same body

4605
02:46:48,559 --> 02:46:52,318
as gordon ryan this is a thought

4606
02:46:49,840 --> 02:46:55,040
experiment what would it take

4607
02:46:52,318 --> 02:46:55,680
to create a mind that would defeat the

4608
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:58,560
mind

4609
02:46:55,680 --> 02:46:58,559
of gordon ryan

4610
02:46:59,600 --> 02:47:05,359
based on the chess example it would

4611
02:47:02,879 --> 02:47:07,119
appear that this is entirely feasible

4612
02:47:05,359 --> 02:47:08,318
at some point in the future and in fact

4613
02:47:07,120 --> 02:47:09,600
i would go further and say it's actually

4614
02:47:08,318 --> 02:47:11,920
quite likely

4615
02:47:09,600 --> 02:47:13,920
based on what we've seen from the

4616
02:47:11,920 --> 02:47:17,200
example of chess

4617
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:19,840
the rate of progress in a.i in the last

4618
02:47:17,200 --> 02:47:22,079
20 years

4619
02:47:19,840 --> 02:47:22,880
or has dwarfed anything from the

4620
02:47:22,079 --> 02:47:26,799
previous

4621
02:47:22,879 --> 02:47:30,478
50 years and the rate continues

4622
02:47:26,799 --> 02:47:30,879
to increase we're talking now at a level

4623
02:47:30,478 --> 02:47:33,679
with

4624
02:47:30,879 --> 02:47:34,559
machine learning defeating world

4625
02:47:33,680 --> 02:47:38,079
champions

4626
02:47:34,559 --> 02:47:40,398
in chess and go and four hours like

4627
02:47:38,079 --> 02:47:41,600
just from starting from the rules of the

4628
02:47:40,398 --> 02:47:45,599
sport

4629
02:47:41,600 --> 02:47:45,920
um this is this is going to be difficult

4630
02:47:45,600 --> 02:47:48,239
for

4631
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:49,040
humans to keep up with now in humans

4632
02:47:48,239 --> 02:47:52,318
favor

4633
02:47:49,040 --> 02:47:54,960
could we take gordon ryan and put

4634
02:47:52,318 --> 02:47:57,359
a chip inside his brain that created the

4635
02:47:54,959 --> 02:47:59,119
same cyborg effect as we saw in centaur

4636
02:47:57,359 --> 02:48:01,279
chess and cyborg chairs

4637
02:47:59,120 --> 02:48:03,520
and then take gordon ryan to a new level

4638
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:05,680
where suddenly his computational powers

4639
02:48:03,520 --> 02:48:07,920
were massively increased he still has

4640
02:48:05,680 --> 02:48:10,000
his heuristic insight

4641
02:48:07,920 --> 02:48:11,760
but he has vastly augmented

4642
02:48:10,000 --> 02:48:15,439
computational powers

4643
02:48:11,760 --> 02:48:16,880
that's the interesting battle i uh

4644
02:48:15,439 --> 02:48:18,479
you asked a great question lex let me

4645
02:48:16,879 --> 02:48:20,639
give you my initial

4646
02:48:18,478 --> 02:48:22,478
push or for an answer would be that if

4647
02:48:20,639 --> 02:48:25,519
it's just gordon ryan

4648
02:48:22,478 --> 02:48:26,799
versus your your uh your robot

4649
02:48:25,520 --> 02:48:28,800
technology

4650
02:48:26,799 --> 02:48:30,000
in 10 years i would say with machine

4651
02:48:28,799 --> 02:48:33,438
learning i

4652
02:48:30,000 --> 02:48:38,879
say you guys win every time but if it is

4653
02:48:33,439 --> 02:48:40,800
cyborg gordon ryan where he's part

4654
02:48:38,879 --> 02:48:42,799
part gordon ryan with heuristics and

4655
02:48:40,799 --> 02:48:43,920
part machine then

4656
02:48:42,799 --> 02:48:46,959
and now that's where i throw the

4657
02:48:43,920 --> 02:48:48,960
question back at you young man

4658
02:48:46,959 --> 02:48:50,079
what do you think well it's fascinating

4659
02:48:48,959 --> 02:48:51,679
to hear your answer that's very

4660
02:48:50,079 --> 02:48:53,120
interesting because because there's a

4661
02:48:51,680 --> 02:48:55,200
there's a lot of different ways you can

4662
02:48:53,120 --> 02:48:58,319
build a cyborg gordon ryan

4663
02:48:55,200 --> 02:49:01,760
so one is there's the neural link way

4664
02:48:58,318 --> 02:49:04,318
which is basically

4665
02:49:01,760 --> 02:49:04,800
say doing what you're suggesting which

4666
02:49:04,318 --> 02:49:06,959
is

4667
02:49:04,799 --> 02:49:09,920
expanding the computational capabilities

4668
02:49:06,959 --> 02:49:11,679
of gordon ryan's brain

4669
02:49:09,920 --> 02:49:13,600
like directly being able to communicate

4670
02:49:11,680 --> 02:49:16,960
between a computer and the brain

4671
02:49:13,600 --> 02:49:19,840
so most of you preserve

4672
02:49:16,959 --> 02:49:21,438
uh most of what there is in the human

4673
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:23,200
body including the nervous system and

4674
02:49:21,439 --> 02:49:25,120
the the computing system we currently

4675
02:49:23,200 --> 02:49:26,399
have that's biological and expanding it

4676
02:49:25,120 --> 02:49:30,240
with the computer

4677
02:49:26,398 --> 02:49:33,439
there's also on the cyborg chest front

4678
02:49:30,239 --> 02:49:35,439
the like magnus carlson the current

4679
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:38,639
world champion in chess

4680
02:49:35,439 --> 02:49:40,880
he studies alpha zero games

4681
02:49:38,639 --> 02:49:42,239
like that it's not a regular thing for

4682
02:49:40,879 --> 02:49:44,959
high-level grand masters

4683
02:49:42,239 --> 02:49:46,318
from what i understand almost every uh

4684
02:49:44,959 --> 02:49:48,159
chess master now

4685
02:49:46,318 --> 02:49:50,318
studies computer games for for

4686
02:49:48,159 --> 02:49:54,318
inspiration like that

4687
02:49:50,318 --> 02:49:55,840
just as um great chess players from the

4688
02:49:54,318 --> 02:49:57,920
past used to go back into old

4689
02:49:55,840 --> 02:50:00,079
leather-bound books of previous

4690
02:49:57,920 --> 02:50:02,000
grand masters and study games and books

4691
02:50:00,079 --> 02:50:03,920
nowadays most people

4692
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:05,439
when they want to study the most perfect

4693
02:50:03,920 --> 02:50:07,680
games they actually study

4694
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:09,760
programs like alpha zero yeah and it's

4695
02:50:07,680 --> 02:50:10,559
not just for inspiration it's education

4696
02:50:09,760 --> 02:50:12,000
it's i mean it's

4697
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:14,159
literally part of their training right

4698
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:16,639
yeah this isn't like a fun

4699
02:50:14,159 --> 02:50:18,159
side thing it's just the main way to get

4700
02:50:16,639 --> 02:50:21,278
better

4701
02:50:18,159 --> 02:50:22,000
so um so there's a certain element there

4702
02:50:21,279 --> 02:50:24,560
where even

4703
02:50:22,000 --> 02:50:25,920
our human brains can be trained by

4704
02:50:24,559 --> 02:50:28,959
observing

4705
02:50:25,920 --> 02:50:31,040
the partial explorations

4706
02:50:28,959 --> 02:50:32,318
of an ai systems in the space of

4707
02:50:31,040 --> 02:50:34,160
grappling

4708
02:50:32,318 --> 02:50:35,600
that could be actually in simulation it

4709
02:50:34,159 --> 02:50:38,959
doesn't have to be in the physical world

4710
02:50:35,600 --> 02:50:41,120
it could be uh in

4711
02:50:38,959 --> 02:50:43,919
if we construct sufficiently good

4712
02:50:41,120 --> 02:50:46,160
biomechanical models of human beings

4713
02:50:43,920 --> 02:50:48,318
machines can learn how they grapple

4714
02:50:46,159 --> 02:50:51,520
there's there's quite a bit of

4715
02:50:48,318 --> 02:50:51,840
that already open ai has the system of

4716
02:50:51,520 --> 02:50:53,760
uh

4717
02:50:51,840 --> 02:50:56,079
there's like sumo wrestlers with some

4718
02:50:53,760 --> 02:50:56,398
basic goals of pushing each other off of

4719
02:50:56,079 --> 02:50:59,359
a

4720
02:50:56,398 --> 02:51:00,879
platform and you know nothing from the

4721
02:50:59,359 --> 02:51:03,840
you don't even know

4722
02:51:00,879 --> 02:51:04,639
so you have a basic model of a bipedal

4723
02:51:03,840 --> 02:51:06,000
system

4724
02:51:04,639 --> 02:51:08,239
it doesn't even know in the beginning

4725
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:10,799
how to stand up it just falls

4726
02:51:08,239 --> 02:51:12,959
right so it has to learn how to get up

4727
02:51:10,799 --> 02:51:14,879
and they do that through self play

4728
02:51:12,959 --> 02:51:16,639
they they learn how to get up they learn

4729
02:51:14,879 --> 02:51:18,799
how to move enough to

4730
02:51:16,639 --> 02:51:20,318
achieve the final goal which is to push

4731
02:51:18,799 --> 02:51:23,039
your opponent off of the thing

4732
02:51:20,318 --> 02:51:24,159
fascinating so they've learned that now

4733
02:51:23,040 --> 02:51:26,640
open ai

4734
02:51:24,159 --> 02:51:28,398
is not those folks are currently not

4735
02:51:26,639 --> 02:51:30,239
that interested in the grappling world

4736
02:51:28,398 --> 02:51:33,439
so they kind of stop there

4737
02:51:30,239 --> 02:51:34,799
but it's very possible in stimulation to

4738
02:51:33,439 --> 02:51:37,760
then

4739
02:51:34,799 --> 02:51:38,079
develop ideas in fact this is something

4740
02:51:37,760 --> 02:51:39,600
i

4741
02:51:38,079 --> 02:51:41,120
should probably do because it's pretty

4742
02:51:39,600 --> 02:51:43,120
natural to do and easy

4743
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:44,960
is ideas of control and submission and

4744
02:51:43,120 --> 02:51:47,280
all all the

4745
02:51:44,959 --> 02:51:48,478
you know you add the ability to

4746
02:51:47,280 --> 02:51:50,239
[Music]

4747
02:51:48,478 --> 02:51:51,760
i don't know how to put it nicely but to

4748
02:51:50,239 --> 02:51:54,799
uh to

4749
02:51:51,760 --> 02:51:58,239
choke your opponent uh and uh

4750
02:51:54,799 --> 02:51:59,438
to break their body parts off which is

4751
02:51:58,239 --> 02:52:02,639
what

4752
02:51:59,439 --> 02:52:04,318
is add that in and what kind of

4753
02:52:02,639 --> 02:52:05,760
ideas they'll come up with is very

4754
02:52:04,318 --> 02:52:06,799
fascinating i

4755
02:52:05,760 --> 02:52:08,000
actually don't know until this

4756
02:52:06,799 --> 02:52:09,438
conversation i don't know why i never

4757
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:11,520
even thought about that i've been very

4758
02:52:09,439 --> 02:52:12,960
obsessed with just like walking and

4759
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:15,120
and running and all those kinds of

4760
02:52:12,959 --> 02:52:17,759
things like evolving

4761
02:52:15,120 --> 02:52:18,800
different strategies for when you have a

4762
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:21,279
bunch of

4763
02:52:18,799 --> 02:52:22,639
so one difficult thing for robots is

4764
02:52:21,279 --> 02:52:23,760
when you have uneven terrain

4765
02:52:22,639 --> 02:52:25,760
and there's uncertainty about the

4766
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:28,000
terrain it's how to keep walking

4767
02:52:25,760 --> 02:52:29,520
or when when there's a bunch of things

4768
02:52:28,000 --> 02:52:29,920
being thrown at you all that kind of

4769
02:52:29,520 --> 02:52:33,040
stuff

4770
02:52:29,920 --> 02:52:34,639
and you learn uh through self-play how

4771
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:36,479
to be able to navigate those uncertain

4772
02:52:34,639 --> 02:52:38,398
environments when there's a lot of weird

4773
02:52:36,478 --> 02:52:40,079
objects and all those kinds of things

4774
02:52:38,398 --> 02:52:42,239
there's no reason why you can't just do

4775
02:52:40,079 --> 02:52:43,600
that with uh with submissions

4776
02:52:42,239 --> 02:52:45,680
and so on in simulation that'll be

4777
02:52:43,600 --> 02:52:49,520
actually fascinating but

4778
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:51,200
once we might be surprised by the kind

4779
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:53,840
of strategies

4780
02:52:51,200 --> 02:52:54,560
in simulation these ai systems will

4781
02:52:53,840 --> 02:52:56,559
develop

4782
02:52:54,559 --> 02:52:58,639
and that might make a much better gordon

4783
02:52:56,559 --> 02:53:01,119
ryan and much better john donohar

4784
02:52:58,639 --> 02:53:03,680
in wait it in asking the dean lister

4785
02:53:01,120 --> 02:53:07,520
question of like why are we only using

4786
02:53:03,680 --> 02:53:08,960
why are we not doing x but on the actual

4787
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:12,560
sort of

4788
02:53:08,959 --> 02:53:14,478
grappling event in the physical space

4789
02:53:12,559 --> 02:53:16,879
i've been very surprised and a little

4790
02:53:14,478 --> 02:53:20,159
bit disappointed by how difficult

4791
02:53:16,879 --> 02:53:20,159
it's to build

4792
02:53:20,799 --> 02:53:26,879
a system that's able to

4793
02:53:24,799 --> 02:53:28,879
have the body of gordon ryan or a human

4794
02:53:26,879 --> 02:53:31,039
being actually

4795
02:53:28,879 --> 02:53:32,719
which means it's not just the the

4796
02:53:31,040 --> 02:53:33,600
biomechanics which is very difficult to

4797
02:53:32,719 --> 02:53:36,639
do

4798
02:53:33,600 --> 02:53:37,680
but also all of the senses that are

4799
02:53:36,639 --> 02:53:40,239
involved

4800
02:53:37,680 --> 02:53:41,760
be able to perceive the world as richly

4801
02:53:40,239 --> 02:53:43,600
to be able to

4802
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:46,800
there's something called soft robotics

4803
02:53:43,600 --> 02:53:48,880
which is is incredibly difficult to do

4804
02:53:46,799 --> 02:53:50,000
through touch understand the hardness of

4805
02:53:48,879 --> 02:53:53,119
things

4806
02:53:50,000 --> 02:53:56,318
we don't understand as human beings just

4807
02:53:53,120 --> 02:53:57,680
how much we're able to touch to

4808
02:53:56,318 --> 02:54:00,159
experience the world

4809
02:53:57,680 --> 02:54:03,120
and to manipulate the world like the the

4810
02:54:00,159 --> 02:54:04,639
the process of picking up a cup

4811
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:06,479
is very similar to the process of

4812
02:54:04,639 --> 02:54:08,318
grappling all the feeling

4813
02:54:06,478 --> 02:54:09,840
that you do all the leverage that you're

4814
02:54:08,318 --> 02:54:12,799
applying there is

4815
02:54:09,840 --> 02:54:14,478
so many degrees of freedom in both the

4816
02:54:12,799 --> 02:54:16,478
in the interactive sense

4817
02:54:14,478 --> 02:54:18,239
in the sensing and the applying sensing

4818
02:54:16,478 --> 02:54:20,879
and applying you're doing that

4819
02:54:18,239 --> 02:54:21,840
through so much of your body that's just

4820
02:54:20,879 --> 02:54:24,879
going to be

4821
02:54:21,840 --> 02:54:27,120
very difficult to build a system that's

4822
02:54:24,879 --> 02:54:29,759
able to experience the world and act

4823
02:54:27,120 --> 02:54:30,160
onto the world as richly as we humans

4824
02:54:29,760 --> 02:54:34,318
can

4825
02:54:30,159 --> 02:54:36,079
yeah if um if picking up a cup is

4826
02:54:34,318 --> 02:54:38,318
a seemingly insurmountable challenge

4827
02:54:36,079 --> 02:54:39,920
then then taking someone down

4828
02:54:38,318 --> 02:54:42,719
controlling them getting past their legs

4829
02:54:39,920 --> 02:54:44,960
that's going to be one hell of a project

4830
02:54:42,719 --> 02:54:46,840
exactly i mean there could be shortcuts

4831
02:54:44,959 --> 02:54:50,000
but i mean currently that's

4832
02:54:46,840 --> 02:54:52,079
um that's that's the field called uh

4833
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:52,719
robotic manipulation which is picking up

4834
02:54:52,079 --> 02:54:54,159
objects

4835
02:54:52,719 --> 02:54:56,559
usually they have like a ball and a

4836
02:54:54,159 --> 02:54:58,318
triangular object and your whole task is

4837
02:54:56,559 --> 02:55:01,199
to like pick it up and

4838
02:54:58,318 --> 02:55:02,478
move it around generalizing that to the

4839
02:55:01,200 --> 02:55:05,600
human body

4840
02:55:02,478 --> 02:55:08,239
is harder but

4841
02:55:05,600 --> 02:55:09,040
perhaps not so so not as hard as we

4842
02:55:08,239 --> 02:55:10,719
might think

4843
02:55:09,040 --> 02:55:13,359
the question is how do you construct

4844
02:55:10,719 --> 02:55:16,478
experiments where you can do that safely

4845
02:55:13,359 --> 02:55:21,520
and chase that's very easy but here

4846
02:55:16,478 --> 02:55:21,519
it's very very problematic um

4847
02:55:22,318 --> 02:55:25,760
i guess you could just have robot versus

4848
02:55:23,920 --> 02:55:27,200
robot

4849
02:55:25,760 --> 02:55:28,478
teamed up with each other and then they

4850
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:29,359
learn and they're about to take on a

4851
02:55:28,478 --> 02:55:31,920
human opponent

4852
02:55:29,359 --> 02:55:33,200
yes exactly so you have two physical

4853
02:55:31,920 --> 02:55:35,600
robots

4854
02:55:33,200 --> 02:55:37,760
that interact with each other everything

4855
02:55:35,600 --> 02:55:39,600
you've said so far suggests that

4856
02:55:37,760 --> 02:55:43,520
many of the problems these tactical

4857
02:55:39,600 --> 02:55:45,520
elements they're easy tasks for humans

4858
02:55:43,520 --> 02:55:47,120
so which becomes more powerful more

4859
02:55:45,520 --> 02:55:48,880
quickly

4860
02:55:47,120 --> 02:55:50,960
robots that are taught to think like

4861
02:55:48,879 --> 02:55:54,318
humans or humans that are given

4862
02:55:50,959 --> 02:55:57,199
the computational power of uh of

4863
02:55:54,318 --> 02:55:58,000
of computers and robots themselves which

4864
02:55:57,200 --> 02:56:01,520
wins first

4865
02:55:58,000 --> 02:56:04,559
a cyborg gordon ryan or an artificial

4866
02:56:01,520 --> 02:56:05,120
robot gordon ryan really really strong

4867
02:56:04,559 --> 02:56:08,959
question

4868
02:56:05,120 --> 02:56:10,399
and i think i think by far the cyborg

4869
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:11,199
gordon ryan yeah that's what i'm

4870
02:56:10,398 --> 02:56:14,239
thinking here

4871
02:56:11,200 --> 02:56:15,520
the problems you're talking about uh

4872
02:56:14,239 --> 02:56:17,279
with regards to the robots those are

4873
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:20,159
those are deep problems like if

4874
02:56:17,279 --> 02:56:20,720
if picking up a cup is problematic it's

4875
02:56:20,159 --> 02:56:23,039
gonna be

4876
02:56:20,719 --> 02:56:24,559
damn difficult to but to a human let's

4877
02:56:23,040 --> 02:56:25,279
say you know that two-year-old can do

4878
02:56:24,559 --> 02:56:27,600
that

4879
02:56:25,279 --> 02:56:28,720
you're highlighting a very important

4880
02:56:27,600 --> 02:56:30,239
differences

4881
02:56:28,719 --> 02:56:32,079
human beings have something called

4882
02:56:30,239 --> 02:56:33,920
common sense

4883
02:56:32,079 --> 02:56:35,680
that we don't know how to build into

4884
02:56:33,920 --> 02:56:37,680
computers currently that's what picking

4885
02:56:35,680 --> 02:56:40,559
up the cup is

4886
02:56:37,680 --> 02:56:42,559
is some basic rules about the way this

4887
02:56:40,559 --> 02:56:44,559
world works we're able to this is when

4888
02:56:42,559 --> 02:56:45,920
we're children and we'll crawl around we

4889
02:56:44,559 --> 02:56:47,600
pick up

4890
02:56:45,920 --> 02:56:50,000
what humans don't have that machines

4891
02:56:47,600 --> 02:56:52,079
have is

4892
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:54,318
incredible computational power and

4893
02:56:52,079 --> 02:56:56,318
access to infinite knowledge

4894
02:56:54,318 --> 02:56:58,000
computers can do that so if if you have

4895
02:56:56,318 --> 02:57:00,000
a gordon rhine with the infinite

4896
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:02,398
knowledge and compute power

4897
02:57:00,000 --> 02:57:03,600
that's just going to because we know how

4898
02:57:02,398 --> 02:57:06,478
to do that

4899
02:57:03,600 --> 02:57:08,559
that that's going to blow out of the

4900
02:57:06,478 --> 02:57:12,478
water

4901
02:57:08,559 --> 02:57:13,199
update on the um uh the phenomenon of

4902
02:57:12,478 --> 02:57:15,278
cyborg

4903
02:57:13,200 --> 02:57:16,880
or centaur chess there was some debate

4904
02:57:15,279 --> 02:57:20,640
as to whether or not

4905
02:57:16,879 --> 02:57:24,159
um cyborg chess teams

4906
02:57:20,639 --> 02:57:24,799
could stay competitive with the uh the

4907
02:57:24,159 --> 02:57:26,559
latest

4908
02:57:24,799 --> 02:57:28,318
machine learning has there been any

4909
02:57:26,559 --> 02:57:28,799
update on that yeah i believe at this

4910
02:57:28,318 --> 02:57:32,478
point

4911
02:57:28,799 --> 02:57:36,000
machines dominate over the

4912
02:57:32,478 --> 02:57:38,318
machine human pairs with the human pairs

4913
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:39,520
when they first came out they were good

4914
02:57:38,318 --> 02:57:42,159
chess players

4915
02:57:39,520 --> 02:57:43,840
but not great chess players does it make

4916
02:57:42,159 --> 02:57:47,279
any difference if you have say

4917
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:49,840
gary kasparov and uh

4918
02:57:47,279 --> 02:57:50,319
and a a computer work in unison buses

4919
02:57:49,840 --> 02:57:53,439
yeah

4920
02:57:50,318 --> 02:57:54,719
joe blow from no no it does make a huge

4921
02:57:53,439 --> 02:57:56,079
difference but yeah both

4922
02:57:54,719 --> 02:57:57,199
are destroyed by machines that are

4923
02:57:56,079 --> 02:57:58,159
interesting and it's not even

4924
02:57:57,200 --> 02:58:00,159
competitive no

4925
02:57:58,159 --> 02:58:01,680
no it's not competitive but they also

4926
02:58:00,159 --> 02:58:04,239
lost interest in this kind of

4927
02:58:01,680 --> 02:58:06,720
uh idea so i think there's still

4928
02:58:04,239 --> 02:58:08,398
competitions between

4929
02:58:06,719 --> 02:58:10,719
human machine pairs versus human machine

4930
02:58:08,398 --> 02:58:12,719
pairs almost like uh

4931
02:58:10,719 --> 02:58:14,478
to see how the two work together but in

4932
02:58:12,719 --> 02:58:14,879
terms of machine versus human machine

4933
02:58:14,478 --> 02:58:18,639
pair

4934
02:58:14,879 --> 02:58:20,639
machines still dominate interesting so

4935
02:58:18,639 --> 02:58:21,840
and and now we've retrieved back as

4936
02:58:20,639 --> 02:58:23,680
human beings

4937
02:58:21,840 --> 02:58:25,600
caring mostly about human versus human

4938
02:58:23,680 --> 02:58:27,120
competition which is probably what the

4939
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:29,520
future will look like

4940
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:30,160
it's very interesting to think but like

4941
02:58:29,520 --> 02:58:32,319
that that

4942
02:58:30,159 --> 02:58:34,398
in chess happened really quickly it

4943
02:58:32,318 --> 02:58:36,239
won't happen

4944
02:58:34,398 --> 02:58:37,760
and it wasn't so painful in chess

4945
02:58:36,239 --> 02:58:41,600
because we care about chess but

4946
02:58:37,760 --> 02:58:44,960
it's not so fundamental to human society

4947
02:58:41,600 --> 02:58:47,680
in uh when you started talking about

4948
02:58:44,959 --> 02:58:48,398
cyborg gordon ryan's which really beyond

4949
02:58:47,680 --> 02:58:51,279
grappling

4950
02:58:48,398 --> 02:58:53,439
is referring to robots operating

4951
02:58:51,279 --> 02:58:56,239
physical space or human

4952
02:58:53,439 --> 02:58:57,359
robot hybrids operating physical space

4953
02:58:56,239 --> 02:59:00,959
you're talking about

4954
02:58:57,359 --> 02:59:03,920
our society is now full of cyborgs yes

4955
02:59:00,959 --> 02:59:07,199
and that that might that transition

4956
02:59:03,920 --> 02:59:09,120
might be very painful or

4957
02:59:07,200 --> 02:59:10,319
transformative in a way we can't even

4958
02:59:09,120 --> 02:59:13,760
predict

4959
02:59:10,318 --> 02:59:18,318
and that very much has applications

4960
02:59:13,760 --> 02:59:21,680
as both china and us now have legalized

4961
02:59:18,318 --> 02:59:22,799
is autonomous weapon systems so use of

4962
02:59:21,680 --> 02:59:25,520
these kinds of systems

4963
02:59:22,799 --> 02:59:25,840
and military applications so it used to

4964
02:59:25,520 --> 02:59:27,680
be

4965
02:59:25,840 --> 02:59:29,680
there'd been a big call in the ai

4966
02:59:27,680 --> 02:59:31,439
community to ban autonomous weapons so

4967
02:59:29,680 --> 02:59:35,520
the use of artificial intelligence

4968
02:59:31,439 --> 02:59:38,398
in in war just like bio weapons are

4969
02:59:35,520 --> 02:59:40,239
banned uh internationally so you're not

4970
02:59:38,398 --> 02:59:43,278
allowed to use bioweapons in war

4971
02:59:40,239 --> 02:59:46,318
and actually most people even terrorists

4972
02:59:43,279 --> 02:59:48,720
have kind of agreed on this ban

4973
02:59:46,318 --> 02:59:50,398
it's not like a there's been a quiet

4974
02:59:48,719 --> 02:59:51,840
agreement like we're not going to be

4975
02:59:50,398 --> 02:59:54,159
doing this because everybody's going to

4976
02:59:51,840 --> 02:59:57,040
get really pissed off

4977
02:59:54,159 --> 02:59:58,799
with autonomous weapon systems that's

4978
02:59:57,040 --> 03:00:00,880
not been the case

4979
02:59:58,799 --> 03:00:03,119
with china has said that they're going

4980
03:00:00,879 --> 03:00:06,639
to be using ai in their military

4981
03:00:03,120 --> 03:00:08,880
and uh the us in 2021

4982
03:00:06,639 --> 03:00:11,519
just released a report saying that

4983
03:00:08,879 --> 03:00:13,278
they're going to um

4984
03:00:11,520 --> 03:00:15,279
they're they're going to add increasing

4985
03:00:13,279 --> 03:00:18,079
amounts of artificial intelligence

4986
03:00:15,279 --> 03:00:18,479
into our military systems into drones

4987
03:00:18,079 --> 03:00:20,239
into

4988
03:00:18,478 --> 03:00:21,920
just everything that's doing any kind of

4989
03:00:20,239 --> 03:00:25,199
both strategic

4990
03:00:21,920 --> 03:00:28,960
and actual like bombing and

4991
03:00:25,200 --> 03:00:31,760
uh defense systems i presume uh

4992
03:00:28,959 --> 03:00:33,438
a drone army would easily defeat a human

4993
03:00:31,760 --> 03:00:37,279
army in the in the near future

4994
03:00:33,439 --> 03:00:38,720
like um i mean think about

4995
03:00:37,279 --> 03:00:40,880
just off the top of my head just think

4996
03:00:38,719 --> 03:00:44,239
about the implication of kamikaze drones

4997
03:00:40,879 --> 03:00:45,920
versus a naval fleet i mean kamikazes

4998
03:00:44,239 --> 03:00:49,119
was humans and world war ii did

4999
03:00:45,920 --> 03:00:53,200
terrible damage to our navy imagine

5000
03:00:49,120 --> 03:00:55,920
swarms of of uh mechanical kamikazes

5001
03:00:53,200 --> 03:00:59,120
which have no fear no remorse i mean

5002
03:00:55,920 --> 03:01:01,359
but it's very uh inefficient kamikaze is

5003
03:00:59,120 --> 03:01:05,040
very inefficient you want to be very

5004
03:01:01,359 --> 03:01:06,000
like war is it's the same discussion to

5005
03:01:05,040 --> 03:01:09,359
jiu jitsu right

5006
03:01:06,000 --> 03:01:11,200
you want to be uh you want to create an

5007
03:01:09,359 --> 03:01:12,720
asymmetry of power and you want to be

5008
03:01:11,200 --> 03:01:13,840
efficient as in the way you deliver that

5009
03:01:12,719 --> 03:01:15,679
power

5010
03:01:13,840 --> 03:01:17,120
it's actually goes back to the picking

5011
03:01:15,680 --> 03:01:21,520
up a cup

5012
03:01:17,120 --> 03:01:23,520
currently a lot of things we do in war

5013
03:01:21,520 --> 03:01:25,600
like so most of the drones that you hear

5014
03:01:23,520 --> 03:01:27,439
about they're not autonomous not most

5015
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:28,720
all they're usually piloted by they're

5016
03:01:27,439 --> 03:01:31,840
piloted remotely

5017
03:01:28,719 --> 03:01:33,519
by humans and humans are really good at

5018
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:35,200
this kind of

5019
03:01:33,520 --> 03:01:37,200
what's necessary to deliver the most

5020
03:01:35,200 --> 03:01:38,720
damage targeted damage

5021
03:01:37,200 --> 03:01:40,800
effective as part of the largest

5022
03:01:38,719 --> 03:01:42,879
strategy have about bombing the area or

5023
03:01:40,799 --> 03:01:44,318
all that kind of stuff

5024
03:01:42,879 --> 03:01:46,079
i don't know how difficult that is to

5025
03:01:44,318 --> 03:01:48,559
automate i think

5026
03:01:46,079 --> 03:01:50,398
the biggest concern i actually have a

5027
03:01:48,559 --> 03:01:53,439
sense that's very difficult to

5028
03:01:50,398 --> 03:01:53,760
automate the biggest concern is almost

5029
03:01:53,439 --> 03:01:56,960
like

5030
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:59,600
an incompetent application of this

5031
03:01:56,959 --> 03:02:01,039
and uh consequences that are not

5032
03:01:59,600 --> 03:02:04,960
anticipated

5033
03:02:01,040 --> 03:02:07,520
so you have a drone army where you say

5034
03:02:04,959 --> 03:02:09,679
we want to target you give it power to

5035
03:02:07,520 --> 03:02:12,159
target a particular terrorist

5036
03:02:09,680 --> 03:02:14,318
and then there's some bug in the system

5037
03:02:12,159 --> 03:02:16,398
that

5038
03:02:14,318 --> 03:02:18,000
has like for example has a large

5039
03:02:16,398 --> 03:02:18,639
uncertainty about the location of that

5040
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:22,000
terrorist

5041
03:02:18,639 --> 03:02:24,239
and so decides to bomb an entire city

5042
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:27,200
you know almost like as a bug a software

5043
03:02:24,239 --> 03:02:29,520
bug i'm much more concerned about like

5044
03:02:27,200 --> 03:02:31,439
bad programming and software engineering

5045
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:34,800
that i am about

5046
03:02:31,439 --> 03:02:37,600
like malevolent ai systems that uh

5047
03:02:34,799 --> 03:02:38,559
destroy the world so the more we rely on

5048
03:02:37,600 --> 03:02:40,239
automation

5049
03:02:38,559 --> 03:02:41,920
this is the lesson of human history the

5050
03:02:40,239 --> 03:02:45,840
more we give to ai

5051
03:02:41,920 --> 03:02:48,960
to software to robotic systems

5052
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:51,520
the more we forget how to

5053
03:02:48,959 --> 03:02:52,159
supervise and oversee some of the edge

5054
03:02:51,520 --> 03:02:54,479
cases

5055
03:02:52,159 --> 03:02:56,318
all the weird ways that things go wrong

5056
03:02:54,478 --> 03:02:58,799
and then

5057
03:02:56,318 --> 03:03:01,600
the more stupid software bugs can lead

5058
03:02:58,799 --> 03:03:03,759
to huge damage like

5059
03:03:01,600 --> 03:03:05,680
you know even like nuclear explosions

5060
03:03:03,760 --> 03:03:09,520
those kinds of things

5061
03:03:05,680 --> 03:03:13,200
if we add ai into the launch systems

5062
03:03:09,520 --> 03:03:15,760
for nuclear weapons for example

5063
03:03:13,200 --> 03:03:16,960
i think human history teaches us that

5064
03:03:15,760 --> 03:03:20,079
software bugs

5065
03:03:16,959 --> 03:03:21,039
is what will leave lead to world war

5066
03:03:20,079 --> 03:03:25,680
three

5067
03:03:21,040 --> 03:03:26,720
not malevolent ai or human beings

5068
03:03:25,680 --> 03:03:28,318
interesting

5069
03:03:26,719 --> 03:03:30,079
by the way i deeply appreciate how

5070
03:03:28,318 --> 03:03:31,439
knowledgeable you are about the history

5071
03:03:30,079 --> 03:03:32,079
of artificial intelligence that was

5072
03:03:31,439 --> 03:03:34,079
awesome oh no

5073
03:03:32,079 --> 03:03:36,000
it's fascinating stuff you know i

5074
03:03:34,079 --> 03:03:36,559
remember reading when i was a child

5075
03:03:36,000 --> 03:03:38,239
about

5076
03:03:36,559 --> 03:03:40,799
you know turing tests and things like

5077
03:03:38,239 --> 03:03:42,079
this and visionaries from the 1950s had

5078
03:03:40,799 --> 03:03:43,599
ideas but

5079
03:03:42,079 --> 03:03:47,279
to see it come this far is just

5080
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:47,279
fascinating to me um

5081
03:03:47,760 --> 03:03:51,279
okay so so what can we as jujitsu

5082
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:54,318
players take away from this

5083
03:03:51,279 --> 03:03:57,600
we saw that when it comes to computers

5084
03:03:54,318 --> 03:04:01,039
versus humans in chess tournaments

5085
03:03:57,600 --> 03:04:03,520
humans had something truly valuable

5086
03:04:01,040 --> 03:04:05,920
to give to the computers that was

5087
03:04:03,520 --> 03:04:09,520
heuristic rules

5088
03:04:05,920 --> 03:04:12,719
in every coaching program that i run

5089
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:15,920
i make an endless quest

5090
03:04:12,719 --> 03:04:18,719
to search out and find effective

5091
03:04:15,920 --> 03:04:20,960
heuristic rules that's the basis of a

5092
03:04:18,719 --> 03:04:24,398
good training program

5093
03:04:20,959 --> 03:04:27,438
heuristic rules and principles

5094
03:04:24,398 --> 03:04:29,199
give vast informational content

5095
03:04:27,439 --> 03:04:30,800
which can rapidly increase your

5096
03:04:29,200 --> 03:04:32,479
performance on the mat

5097
03:04:30,799 --> 03:04:34,318
just as they rapidly increase the

5098
03:04:32,478 --> 03:04:38,879
performance of chess computers

5099
03:04:34,318 --> 03:04:38,879
to overcome the human adversaries

5100
03:04:39,359 --> 03:04:43,680
the great human weakness is

5101
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:46,639
computational power

5102
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:47,920
most people vastly overestimate their

5103
03:04:46,639 --> 03:04:51,439
ability

5104
03:04:47,920 --> 03:04:53,840
to reason and problem solve under stress

5105
03:04:51,439 --> 03:04:55,680
in fact numerous psychological studies

5106
03:04:53,840 --> 03:04:58,960
have shown that humans can balance

5107
03:04:55,680 --> 03:05:02,159
a relatively small number of uh

5108
03:04:58,959 --> 03:05:03,679
of competing options in in in stressful

5109
03:05:02,159 --> 03:05:06,559
decision making

5110
03:05:03,680 --> 03:05:07,359
but what we do have what is it the great

5111
03:05:06,559 --> 03:05:11,119
and unique

5112
03:05:07,359 --> 03:05:13,120
human gift is this idea to come up

5113
03:05:11,120 --> 03:05:15,520
and arrive at heuristic rules and

5114
03:05:13,120 --> 03:05:18,000
principles which turn out to be

5115
03:05:15,520 --> 03:05:19,439
very effective guides to behavior for

5116
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:23,359
both human behavior

5117
03:05:19,439 --> 03:05:27,359
and artificially intelligent behavior

5118
03:05:23,359 --> 03:05:29,439
make that your focus in study

5119
03:05:27,359 --> 03:05:31,200
don't try to remember ten thousand

5120
03:05:29,439 --> 03:05:33,120
different details on a move

5121
03:05:31,200 --> 03:05:34,720
okay that's that's human weakness not

5122
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:37,439
human strength

5123
03:05:34,719 --> 03:05:38,799
our strength is heuristics make that

5124
03:05:37,439 --> 03:05:42,559
your focus

5125
03:05:38,799 --> 03:05:44,478
not endless computations over 25 details

5126
03:05:42,559 --> 03:05:45,920
here merge with 27 details here

5127
03:05:44,478 --> 03:05:47,760
that's not that's not what humans are

5128
03:05:45,920 --> 03:05:51,200
good at

5129
03:05:47,760 --> 03:05:53,120
the uniquely human strength is arriving

5130
03:05:51,200 --> 03:05:54,640
at these heuristic rules and principles

5131
03:05:53,120 --> 03:05:57,040
which guide our behavior

5132
03:05:54,639 --> 03:05:58,079
which provides simplifications which

5133
03:05:57,040 --> 03:06:00,640
enable us to take

5134
03:05:58,079 --> 03:06:02,239
vast amounts of information and parry it

5135
03:06:00,639 --> 03:06:04,318
down to a few simple rules that

5136
03:06:02,239 --> 03:06:05,760
effectively guide our behavior

5137
03:06:04,318 --> 03:06:07,359
take that core insight from the

5138
03:06:05,760 --> 03:06:08,880
discussion that lex and i just had it

5139
03:06:07,359 --> 03:06:10,318
was a complex discussion we both

5140
03:06:08,879 --> 03:06:12,000
apologize for going a little bit

5141
03:06:10,318 --> 03:06:13,519
overwatch that was awesome then dragging

5142
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:15,040
you into some details there but take

5143
03:06:13,520 --> 03:06:16,399
that away from it love it it'll make you

5144
03:06:15,040 --> 03:06:19,600
better at jiu-jitsu

5145
03:06:16,398 --> 03:06:21,519
sorry legs that was uh

5146
03:06:19,600 --> 03:06:23,600
that was a really exciting discussion

5147
03:06:21,520 --> 03:06:25,359
and uh

5148
03:06:23,600 --> 03:06:27,359
the depths of knowledge in the

5149
03:06:25,359 --> 03:06:28,640
dimensions of knowledge you have

5150
03:06:27,359 --> 03:06:31,520
and interests you have is just

5151
03:06:28,639 --> 03:06:33,920
fascinating is there advice you have for

5152
03:06:31,520 --> 03:06:35,840
complete beginners

5153
03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:37,359
for white belts that are starting jiu

5154
03:06:35,840 --> 03:06:38,960
jitsu that are listening to this they

5155
03:06:37,359 --> 03:06:40,318
haven't done jiu jitsu i know there's a

5156
03:06:38,959 --> 03:06:43,278
lot of people who are

5157
03:06:40,318 --> 03:06:44,318
super curious to start is there advice

5158
03:06:43,279 --> 03:06:46,880
you would give them

5159
03:06:44,318 --> 03:06:48,478
on their journey uh yeah i'm just going

5160
03:06:46,879 --> 03:06:50,159
to talk about just

5161
03:06:48,478 --> 03:06:51,358
getting better on the mat okay because

5162
03:06:50,159 --> 03:06:52,799
there's a thousand other things you can

5163
03:06:51,359 --> 03:06:55,680
talk about in terms of like

5164
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:56,799
morale and persistence and um how often

5165
03:06:55,680 --> 03:06:58,159
they should train is a thousand things

5166
03:06:56,799 --> 03:06:59,199
you get break up with your girlfriend or

5167
03:06:58,159 --> 03:07:02,719
boyfriend

5168
03:06:59,200 --> 03:07:04,640
that's one let's put that aside um

5169
03:07:02,719 --> 03:07:07,438
that's probably the best advice we give

5170
03:07:04,639 --> 03:07:10,478
um it goes back to what we said earlier

5171
03:07:07,439 --> 03:07:11,840
uh i always advocate start your training

5172
03:07:10,478 --> 03:07:15,599
from the ground up

5173
03:07:11,840 --> 03:07:16,719
okay your first sessions in jiu-jitsu

5174
03:07:15,600 --> 03:07:19,520
you're going to find

5175
03:07:16,719 --> 03:07:21,278
to your horror that everyone gets on top

5176
03:07:19,520 --> 03:07:24,239
of you and you can't get out

5177
03:07:21,279 --> 03:07:25,200
and it's a dispiriting crushing kind of

5178
03:07:24,239 --> 03:07:26,879
feeling that you

5179
03:07:25,200 --> 03:07:28,640
just have no skills and you have no

5180
03:07:26,879 --> 03:07:30,639
prospects in the sport

5181
03:07:28,639 --> 03:07:32,318
so your first skill is the skill of

5182
03:07:30,639 --> 03:07:36,159
being able to free yourself

5183
03:07:32,318 --> 03:07:37,039
from positional pins most of the escapes

5184
03:07:36,159 --> 03:07:40,559
in jiu-jitsu

5185
03:07:37,040 --> 03:07:41,520
go to guard position and so once you get

5186
03:07:40,559 --> 03:07:42,959
someone in your guard they're going to

5187
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:45,040
be looking to pass your guard

5188
03:07:42,959 --> 03:07:47,119
and get back into those positional pins

5189
03:07:45,040 --> 03:07:49,120
that you just escaped from

5190
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:50,479
and that's just as crushing as getting

5191
03:07:49,120 --> 03:07:51,680
pinned you feel like every time you try

5192
03:07:50,478 --> 03:07:54,159
to hold someone a guard they just

5193
03:07:51,680 --> 03:07:56,479
efficiently pass you by

5194
03:07:54,159 --> 03:07:57,920
so your first two skills you gotta

5195
03:07:56,478 --> 03:07:59,119
better get out of any pin

5196
03:07:57,920 --> 03:08:01,439
and you gotta better hold someone in

5197
03:07:59,120 --> 03:08:02,160
your guard so pin escapes and guard

5198
03:08:01,439 --> 03:08:05,600
retention

5199
03:08:02,159 --> 03:08:08,639
are your first two skills i generally

5200
03:08:05,600 --> 03:08:09,520
advocate the idea of learning to fight

5201
03:08:08,639 --> 03:08:12,398
from your back

5202
03:08:09,520 --> 03:08:12,880
first and then learning to fight from on

5203
03:08:12,398 --> 03:08:15,760
top

5204
03:08:12,879 --> 03:08:17,278
second why because the brute fact is

5205
03:08:15,760 --> 03:08:19,279
when you first start off you just don't

5206
03:08:17,279 --> 03:08:21,439
have enough skills to hold top position

5207
03:08:19,279 --> 03:08:23,120
or gain top position through a takedown

5208
03:08:21,439 --> 03:08:24,559
so inevitably you're going to end up

5209
03:08:23,120 --> 03:08:25,840
underneath people for most of your

5210
03:08:24,559 --> 03:08:28,079
training time

5211
03:08:25,840 --> 03:08:30,079
your training should reflect that in the

5212
03:08:28,079 --> 03:08:32,239
early days as a white belt

5213
03:08:30,079 --> 03:08:33,520
start with the first two skills you need

5214
03:08:32,239 --> 03:08:35,039
they're not the most exciting they're

5215
03:08:33,520 --> 03:08:35,439
not sexy skills that are going to make

5216
03:08:35,040 --> 03:08:36,960
you look

5217
03:08:35,439 --> 03:08:38,720
stuck in the training room but they're

5218
03:08:36,959 --> 03:08:40,478
going to keep your life long enough to

5219
03:08:38,719 --> 03:08:43,278
learn those sexy skills in the future

5220
03:08:40,478 --> 03:08:45,679
that'll make you look like a stud

5221
03:08:43,279 --> 03:08:46,399
start with pen escapes go to guard

5222
03:08:45,680 --> 03:08:49,680
retention

5223
03:08:46,398 --> 03:08:50,559
and focus heavily on those two when you

5224
03:08:49,680 --> 03:08:53,680
start to get into

5225
03:08:50,559 --> 03:08:55,600
offense start with bottom position

5226
03:08:53,680 --> 03:08:56,800
so there's a clear continuity between

5227
03:08:55,600 --> 03:08:59,120
your pin escapes

5228
03:08:56,799 --> 03:09:00,398
your guard retention and then your guard

5229
03:08:59,120 --> 03:09:02,319
itself

5230
03:09:00,398 --> 03:09:03,599
okay you've got different options with

5231
03:09:02,318 --> 03:09:04,719
guard

5232
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:06,479
some of you're going to like closed

5233
03:09:04,719 --> 03:09:08,000
guard some of you are going to like

5234
03:09:06,478 --> 03:09:09,358
variations of open guard

5235
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:11,120
some of you going to like to be seated

5236
03:09:09,359 --> 03:09:13,439
some of you like to be supine

5237
03:09:11,120 --> 03:09:15,200
some of you are going to like half guard

5238
03:09:13,439 --> 03:09:17,600
as a general rule

5239
03:09:15,200 --> 03:09:18,880
this is a heavy generalization but i'm

5240
03:09:17,600 --> 03:09:21,920
going to give it to you

5241
03:09:18,879 --> 03:09:24,719
in my experience most people benefit the

5242
03:09:21,920 --> 03:09:26,559
most by starting with half guard first

5243
03:09:24,719 --> 03:09:28,799
i know that traditionally jujitsu has

5244
03:09:26,559 --> 03:09:30,959
been taught closed guard first and then

5245
03:09:28,799 --> 03:09:32,559
all the other guards come after that i'm

5246
03:09:30,959 --> 03:09:35,278
a big believer in the idea of

5247
03:09:32,559 --> 03:09:36,238
start with pen escapes then go to guard

5248
03:09:35,279 --> 03:09:38,000
retention

5249
03:09:36,238 --> 03:09:39,680
and then start with half guard bottom

5250
03:09:38,000 --> 03:09:41,439
that way you get a nice continuity

5251
03:09:39,680 --> 03:09:43,760
between your first three skills

5252
03:09:41,439 --> 03:09:46,800
and you make good progress over those

5253
03:09:43,760 --> 03:09:49,120
first critical six months in jiu-jitsu

5254
03:09:46,799 --> 03:09:50,398
what does it take to get a black belt in

5255
03:09:49,120 --> 03:09:51,420
jiu jitsu

5256
03:09:50,398 --> 03:09:54,879
very little

5257
03:09:51,420 --> 03:09:58,238
[Laughter]

5258
03:09:54,879 --> 03:10:00,559
to show up pay your fees

5259
03:09:58,238 --> 03:10:02,318
don't set your goals low okay don't even

5260
03:10:00,559 --> 03:10:03,439
ask yourself that question no one cares

5261
03:10:02,318 --> 03:10:04,879
if you've got a black belt

5262
03:10:03,439 --> 03:10:07,040
okay the only thing that counts is the

5263
03:10:04,879 --> 03:10:08,799
skills you have i know plenty of black

5264
03:10:07,040 --> 03:10:12,000
belts that suck

5265
03:10:08,799 --> 03:10:14,000
okay there's a lot of them out there um

5266
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:16,159
don't lower your standards by saying i

5267
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:17,600
want to get a black belt

5268
03:10:16,159 --> 03:10:20,639
ask yourself something much more

5269
03:10:17,600 --> 03:10:22,000
important how good do i want to be

5270
03:10:20,639 --> 03:10:23,199
you want to be damn good right you want

5271
03:10:22,000 --> 03:10:24,719
to do something invest time and you want

5272
03:10:23,200 --> 03:10:26,319
to be the best you can

5273
03:10:24,719 --> 03:10:29,039
wearing a belt around your waist doesn't

5274
03:10:26,318 --> 03:10:30,879
guarantee that build skills focus on

5275
03:10:29,040 --> 03:10:35,359
that

5276
03:10:30,879 --> 03:10:38,478
let me ask you about the fourth thing in

5277
03:10:35,359 --> 03:10:39,600
facet face of jiu jitsu which is self

5278
03:10:38,478 --> 03:10:42,318
defense

5279
03:10:39,600 --> 03:10:43,120
let's say the bigger things i don't know

5280
03:10:42,318 --> 03:10:44,159
if you

5281
03:10:43,120 --> 03:10:46,560
you know i don't know why it's called

5282
03:10:44,159 --> 03:10:49,680
self-defense it's called street fighting

5283
03:10:46,559 --> 03:10:50,639
let's call it fighting okay maybe maybe

5284
03:10:49,680 --> 03:10:52,800
you can contest us

5285
03:10:50,639 --> 03:10:54,159
that terminology how about non-sport

5286
03:10:52,799 --> 03:10:55,920
fighting

5287
03:10:54,159 --> 03:10:56,879
non-sports funny like street fighting

5288
03:10:55,920 --> 03:10:58,159
what happens if you go out on a

5289
03:10:56,879 --> 03:11:00,000
playground you're fighting on grass

5290
03:10:58,159 --> 03:11:01,840
they're no longer street fighting

5291
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:04,079
it's like tennis you have like wimbledon

5292
03:11:01,840 --> 03:11:06,960
like grass courts and

5293
03:11:04,079 --> 03:11:07,359
it's a whole other thing uh no is there

5294
03:11:06,959 --> 03:11:09,278
um

5295
03:11:07,359 --> 03:11:11,359
what do you think is the best martial

5296
03:11:09,279 --> 03:11:14,399
art for street fighting

5297
03:11:11,359 --> 03:11:15,279
what is the best set of uh we talked

5298
03:11:14,398 --> 03:11:19,278
about advice

5299
03:11:15,279 --> 03:11:22,319
for white belts to advance in in uh

5300
03:11:19,279 --> 03:11:25,120
in grappling in jiu jitsu

5301
03:11:22,318 --> 03:11:26,478
what is the set of techniques maybe

5302
03:11:25,120 --> 03:11:29,840
martial art that is best

5303
03:11:26,478 --> 03:11:32,079
for street fighting okay um again

5304
03:11:29,840 --> 03:11:34,719
you're asking some truly fascinating

5305
03:11:32,079 --> 03:11:34,719
questions here

5306
03:11:34,840 --> 03:11:39,920
um

5307
03:11:37,600 --> 03:11:41,120
the way this gets framed as a question

5308
03:11:39,920 --> 03:11:42,799
is often

5309
03:11:41,120 --> 03:11:44,640
condemns you to bad answers from the

5310
03:11:42,799 --> 03:11:47,759
start

5311
03:11:44,639 --> 03:11:50,799
this is uh as a questioner i'm i'm

5312
03:11:47,760 --> 03:11:53,840
trying to achieve asymmetry of power

5313
03:11:50,799 --> 03:11:57,759
and i'm winning um

5314
03:11:53,840 --> 03:11:59,600
put you in a bad position don't worry

5315
03:11:57,760 --> 03:12:00,880
so much about people always gonna say

5316
03:11:59,600 --> 03:12:02,000
you know is this martial art better or

5317
03:12:00,879 --> 03:12:05,278
is this martial arts better

5318
03:12:02,000 --> 03:12:08,559
the truth is uh

5319
03:12:05,279 --> 03:12:08,560
there's only one way to say this

5320
03:12:10,639 --> 03:12:16,398
combat sports are your best option for

5321
03:12:14,398 --> 03:12:18,719
self-defense

5322
03:12:16,398 --> 03:12:19,840
there are many martial arts and there is

5323
03:12:18,719 --> 03:12:22,398
a rough divide

5324
03:12:19,840 --> 03:12:25,439
between the two those that fall into

5325
03:12:22,398 --> 03:12:28,719
combat sports and those that fall into

5326
03:12:25,439 --> 03:12:30,960
non-sporting martial arts where there's

5327
03:12:28,719 --> 03:12:30,959
no

5328
03:12:31,120 --> 03:12:38,560
uh competitive

5329
03:12:34,719 --> 03:12:40,879
live sparring element where

5330
03:12:38,559 --> 03:12:43,439
most of the knowledge is limited to

5331
03:12:40,879 --> 03:12:46,478
theoretical knowledge reinforced by

5332
03:12:43,439 --> 03:12:48,318
passive drilling

5333
03:12:46,478 --> 03:12:51,438
if you have a choice between a combat

5334
03:12:48,318 --> 03:12:53,359
sport versus

5335
03:12:51,439 --> 03:12:54,800
a non-sporting art based around

5336
03:12:53,359 --> 03:12:55,439
theoretical knowledge and passive

5337
03:12:54,799 --> 03:12:58,478
drilling

5338
03:12:55,439 --> 03:13:01,040
go with a combat sport

5339
03:12:58,478 --> 03:13:03,840
nothing will prepare you for the

5340
03:13:01,040 --> 03:13:03,840
intensity

5341
03:13:04,398 --> 03:13:10,959
of a genuine altercation better

5342
03:13:07,840 --> 03:13:10,960
than combat sports

5343
03:13:11,040 --> 03:13:14,160
many people as i say these words are

5344
03:13:13,120 --> 03:13:17,680
probably

5345
03:13:14,159 --> 03:13:19,840
horrified to hear me say this and uh

5346
03:13:17,680 --> 03:13:22,079
immediately going to rebut and say no

5347
03:13:19,840 --> 03:13:23,040
combat sports is exactly the wrong thing

5348
03:13:22,079 --> 03:13:26,559
for you to do

5349
03:13:23,040 --> 03:13:27,520
because they have safety rules etc etc

5350
03:13:26,559 --> 03:13:29,439
which

5351
03:13:27,520 --> 03:13:31,359
uh would easily be exploited in a real

5352
03:13:29,439 --> 03:13:32,079
fight and if i fought a world

5353
03:13:31,359 --> 03:13:33,600
championship

5354
03:13:32,079 --> 03:13:35,520
boxer i would just poke them in the eye

5355
03:13:33,600 --> 03:13:37,439
or kick them in the groin etc you heard

5356
03:13:35,520 --> 03:13:40,560
these arguments a thousand times

5357
03:13:37,439 --> 03:13:42,880
um yes there is some validity to these

5358
03:13:40,559 --> 03:13:46,639
things but as a general rule

5359
03:13:42,879 --> 03:13:48,398
if you ask me to bet in any form of

5360
03:13:46,639 --> 03:13:50,000
street fight call it what you want

5361
03:13:48,398 --> 03:13:52,799
between

5362
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:53,200
a combat sport adherent versus someone

5363
03:13:52,799 --> 03:13:57,679
who

5364
03:13:53,200 --> 03:13:59,520
simply trains drills and

5365
03:13:57,680 --> 03:14:00,800
talks in terms of theories of what they

5366
03:13:59,520 --> 03:14:02,800
would do in a fight

5367
03:14:00,799 --> 03:14:04,000
i'm gonna go with the combat sport guy

5368
03:14:02,799 --> 03:14:08,079
every single

5369
03:14:04,000 --> 03:14:11,600
time now having said that

5370
03:14:08,079 --> 03:14:14,079
combat sports need to be modified

5371
03:14:11,600 --> 03:14:15,359
for the use of self-defense street

5372
03:14:14,079 --> 03:14:17,359
fighter we haven't agreed on it to him

5373
03:14:15,359 --> 03:14:20,559
yet we'll figure it out later

5374
03:14:17,359 --> 03:14:21,200
um what does this modification consist

5375
03:14:20,559 --> 03:14:23,600
of

5376
03:14:21,200 --> 03:14:25,200
well some of it is technical okay for

5377
03:14:23,600 --> 03:14:28,399
example

5378
03:14:25,200 --> 03:14:28,960
a boxer in a street fight now has to

5379
03:14:28,398 --> 03:14:31,039
punch

5380
03:14:28,959 --> 03:14:32,238
without wrapped or gloved hands and

5381
03:14:31,040 --> 03:14:35,439
that's problematic

5382
03:14:32,238 --> 03:14:38,398
okay your hands are not really designed

5383
03:14:35,439 --> 03:14:39,920
for heavy extended use of clubbing hot

5384
03:14:38,398 --> 03:14:40,318
objects there's a very high likelihood

5385
03:14:39,920 --> 03:14:42,398
of

5386
03:14:40,318 --> 03:14:44,639
breaking your hands mike tyson was one

5387
03:14:42,398 --> 03:14:46,159
of the finest punches that ever lived

5388
03:14:44,639 --> 03:14:48,000
but in one of his more famous street

5389
03:14:46,159 --> 03:14:51,520
fights against mitch green

5390
03:14:48,000 --> 03:14:53,359
in the late 1980s he broke his hand

5391
03:14:51,520 --> 03:14:55,279
with one punch that he threw his

5392
03:14:53,359 --> 03:14:56,800
opponent hit the wrong part of the head

5393
03:14:55,279 --> 03:14:58,479
and broke his hand and he was one of the

5394
03:14:56,799 --> 03:15:01,039
most gifted punches of all time

5395
03:14:58,478 --> 03:15:02,639
if he can do it you'll certainly have

5396
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:06,720
trouble protecting your hands

5397
03:15:02,639 --> 03:15:11,278
and when you go to throw blows um

5398
03:15:06,719 --> 03:15:14,559
nonetheless this is easily modified and

5399
03:15:11,279 --> 03:15:17,439
so a boxer can throw with with uh

5400
03:15:14,559 --> 03:15:19,519
open hands or with elbows and so just a

5401
03:15:17,439 --> 03:15:22,639
small modification and technique

5402
03:15:19,520 --> 03:15:23,200
can overcome that problem so what you'll

5403
03:15:22,639 --> 03:15:26,318
find

5404
03:15:23,200 --> 03:15:28,079
is that the general physical

5405
03:15:26,318 --> 03:15:29,680
mental conditioning and skill

5406
03:15:28,079 --> 03:15:31,680
development that comes from combat

5407
03:15:29,680 --> 03:15:34,960
sports

5408
03:15:31,680 --> 03:15:37,040
allied with technical

5409
03:15:34,959 --> 03:15:38,639
modifications and then the most

5410
03:15:37,040 --> 03:15:41,840
important of all

5411
03:15:38,639 --> 03:15:42,318
tactical modifications will provide your

5412
03:15:41,840 --> 03:15:45,359
best

5413
03:15:42,318 --> 03:15:47,760
hope in altercations

5414
03:15:45,359 --> 03:15:50,960
outside of sports in the street or

5415
03:15:47,760 --> 03:15:50,960
wherever you find yourself

5416
03:15:52,159 --> 03:15:56,478
the least effective approaches to

5417
03:15:54,559 --> 03:15:59,119
self-defense that i have observed in my

5418
03:15:56,478 --> 03:16:02,159
life have been those where as i said

5419
03:15:59,120 --> 03:16:04,880
people talk to theory

5420
03:16:02,159 --> 03:16:06,799
drilled on passive opponents and

5421
03:16:04,879 --> 03:16:10,318
generally had no engagement

5422
03:16:06,799 --> 03:16:13,519
in live competition or sparring

5423
03:16:10,318 --> 03:16:16,639
in their training programs

5424
03:16:13,520 --> 03:16:20,159
the most effective by a landslide

5425
03:16:16,639 --> 03:16:24,079
with those that put a heavy emphasis on

5426
03:16:20,159 --> 03:16:27,680
live sparring and sporting competition

5427
03:16:24,079 --> 03:16:29,200
modified both technically and tactically

5428
03:16:27,680 --> 03:16:31,200
for the circumstances in which they

5429
03:16:29,200 --> 03:16:33,600
found themselves

5430
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:35,439
people talk for example about how you

5431
03:16:33,600 --> 03:16:37,600
know um

5432
03:16:35,439 --> 03:16:38,800
and with some validity that weapons will

5433
03:16:37,600 --> 03:16:40,720
change everything in a

5434
03:16:38,799 --> 03:16:43,039
in a street fight there's absolute truth

5435
03:16:40,719 --> 03:16:44,559
to that but this extends into weapons as

5436
03:16:43,040 --> 03:16:47,920
well okay

5437
03:16:44,559 --> 03:16:49,920
the most effective forms of of

5438
03:16:47,920 --> 03:16:50,960
knife fighting that you'll see will be

5439
03:16:49,920 --> 03:16:53,040
those who

5440
03:16:50,959 --> 03:16:54,079
come from a background in fencing

5441
03:16:53,040 --> 03:16:56,080
because it has

5442
03:16:54,079 --> 03:16:58,639
sparring and a competitive sport aspect

5443
03:16:56,079 --> 03:16:59,920
to it but would pure fencing be the

5444
03:16:58,639 --> 03:17:00,959
appropriate thing of course not you'd

5445
03:16:59,920 --> 03:17:03,279
have to modify it

5446
03:17:00,959 --> 03:17:05,199
but the reflexes endurance physical

5447
03:17:03,279 --> 03:17:06,159
mobility that you gained from the sport

5448
03:17:05,200 --> 03:17:08,640
of fencing could

5449
03:17:06,159 --> 03:17:10,559
easily be modified to play craft in a in

5450
03:17:08,639 --> 03:17:14,238
a fight situation

5451
03:17:10,559 --> 03:17:17,039
what you want to look for with regards

5452
03:17:14,238 --> 03:17:18,559
street and self-defense is not okay

5453
03:17:17,040 --> 03:17:20,399
which style should i choose should i

5454
03:17:18,559 --> 03:17:22,238
choose taekwondo should i choose karate

5455
03:17:20,398 --> 03:17:23,119
should i choose this variation of kung

5456
03:17:22,238 --> 03:17:25,279
fu no

5457
03:17:23,120 --> 03:17:27,680
focus on the most important thing does

5458
03:17:25,279 --> 03:17:29,600
it have a sport aspect to it

5459
03:17:27,680 --> 03:17:31,200
then once you've made sufficient

5460
03:17:29,600 --> 03:17:32,079
progress in the sport aspect of that

5461
03:17:31,200 --> 03:17:33,760
martial art

5462
03:17:32,079 --> 03:17:36,079
start asking yourself what are the

5463
03:17:33,760 --> 03:17:37,680
requisite modifications and technique

5464
03:17:36,079 --> 03:17:41,120
and tactics that i have to

5465
03:17:37,680 --> 03:17:42,479
to use or to input

5466
03:17:41,120 --> 03:17:44,720
to make it effective for street

5467
03:17:42,478 --> 03:17:45,438
situations that's always the advice that

5468
03:17:44,719 --> 03:17:47,119
i give

5469
03:17:45,439 --> 03:17:49,520
so let me zoom in on a very particular

5470
03:17:47,120 --> 03:17:51,680
aspect of street fighting where

5471
03:17:49,520 --> 03:17:52,960
uh with all due respect i disagree with

5472
03:17:51,680 --> 03:17:55,600
mr joe rogan

5473
03:17:52,959 --> 03:17:57,839
and george st pieron which is uh the

5474
03:17:55,600 --> 03:18:00,559
suit and tie situation

5475
03:17:57,840 --> 03:18:02,079
now to criticize gsp yeah yeah he's very

5476
03:18:00,559 --> 03:18:03,600
accomplished and everything but to

5477
03:18:02,079 --> 03:18:06,238
criticize him for a bit

5478
03:18:03,600 --> 03:18:07,200
he made claims about how dangerous the

5479
03:18:06,238 --> 03:18:09,439
tie is

5480
03:18:07,200 --> 03:18:11,200
in a street fighting situation without

5481
03:18:09,439 --> 03:18:14,000
ever having used them

5482
03:18:11,200 --> 03:18:14,640
in a fighting situation so he made sort

5483
03:18:14,000 --> 03:18:16,478
of

5484
03:18:14,639 --> 03:18:18,318
broad proclamations without

5485
03:18:16,478 --> 03:18:20,478
understanding the fundamentals

5486
03:18:18,318 --> 03:18:21,680
so i thought i would go to somebody who

5487
03:18:20,478 --> 03:18:26,238
uh

5488
03:18:21,680 --> 03:18:29,520
thinks in systems what do you think

5489
03:18:26,238 --> 03:18:30,079
is it um is it dangerous to wear a tie

5490
03:18:29,520 --> 03:18:32,800
or not

5491
03:18:30,079 --> 03:18:33,200
in a grappling situation versus all the

5492
03:18:32,799 --> 03:18:34,398
other way

5493
03:18:33,200 --> 03:18:36,640
we were talking about in a street fight

5494
03:18:34,398 --> 03:18:38,398
here because there was nothing strange

5495
03:18:36,639 --> 03:18:41,358
to wear a tie in a grappling competition

5496
03:18:38,398 --> 03:18:42,879
he would be it would be uh yes in a

5497
03:18:41,359 --> 03:18:46,559
street fight situation okay

5498
03:18:42,879 --> 03:18:48,879
joe rogan thinks it is like the most

5499
03:18:46,559 --> 03:18:49,600
dangerous it's like it becomes your

5500
03:18:48,879 --> 03:18:51,519
weakest

5501
03:18:49,600 --> 03:18:52,880
point if you wear a tie because it's

5502
03:18:51,520 --> 03:18:54,238
very easy to choke

5503
03:18:52,879 --> 03:18:56,639
george saint pierre seemed to have

5504
03:18:54,238 --> 03:18:59,680
agreed with that also george added

5505
03:18:56,639 --> 03:19:01,680
that you can grab the tie and pull the

5506
03:18:59,680 --> 03:19:04,398
person down

5507
03:19:01,680 --> 03:19:05,920
to a knee yeah this is this is the go to

5508
03:19:04,398 --> 03:19:07,760
joe rogan will go for the choke

5509
03:19:05,920 --> 03:19:09,920
george st pierre will go for the tie to

5510
03:19:07,760 --> 03:19:11,520
the knee which i was saying is

5511
03:19:09,920 --> 03:19:14,318
ridiculous so what do you think

5512
03:19:11,520 --> 03:19:15,680
okay um first off i actually can speak

5513
03:19:14,318 --> 03:19:16,959
with experience on this because they

5514
03:19:15,680 --> 03:19:19,439
worked as a balancer for

5515
03:19:16,959 --> 03:19:21,039
over a decade and most of the clubs i

5516
03:19:19,439 --> 03:19:24,479
worked at did not require a suit and

5517
03:19:21,040 --> 03:19:24,479
time but occasionally they did

5518
03:19:25,600 --> 03:19:29,680
okay let's first differentiate between

5519
03:19:27,520 --> 03:19:32,319
the kinds of threats when you wear a tie

5520
03:19:29,680 --> 03:19:33,120
yes if you wear a tie if there is going

5521
03:19:32,318 --> 03:19:35,359
to be a threat

5522
03:19:33,120 --> 03:19:36,479
by far the more important threat is not

5523
03:19:35,359 --> 03:19:39,200
strangulation

5524
03:19:36,478 --> 03:19:40,159
okay being strangled by your tie is

5525
03:19:39,200 --> 03:19:42,800
possible

5526
03:19:40,159 --> 03:19:44,000
but it is a poor choice there are many

5527
03:19:42,799 --> 03:19:45,039
other ways to strangle people that are

5528
03:19:44,000 --> 03:19:47,359
far more efficient

5529
03:19:45,040 --> 03:19:48,080
if i strangle with you you're by your

5530
03:19:47,359 --> 03:19:50,640
tie i'm

5531
03:19:48,079 --> 03:19:52,559
literally in front of you um that means

5532
03:19:50,639 --> 03:19:54,238
as i go to apply the stranglehold i can

5533
03:19:52,559 --> 03:19:55,278
easily be eye gouged at sarah sarah

5534
03:19:54,238 --> 03:19:57,680
if you're going to strangle people on

5535
03:19:55,279 --> 03:19:59,520
the street do it from behind and

5536
03:19:57,680 --> 03:20:02,559
there's just much better ways to do it

5537
03:19:59,520 --> 03:20:04,800
than that hear that joe rogan

5538
03:20:02,559 --> 03:20:06,079
with regards to the snap down question

5539
03:20:04,799 --> 03:20:08,318
that's that is

5540
03:20:06,079 --> 03:20:09,840
more of a problem i always recommend if

5541
03:20:08,318 --> 03:20:10,879
you are going to work as a bouncer with

5542
03:20:09,840 --> 03:20:13,439
a tie

5543
03:20:10,879 --> 03:20:14,398
wear a clip-on tie so it just comes off

5544
03:20:13,439 --> 03:20:16,880
immediately

5545
03:20:14,398 --> 03:20:18,959
if you don't like clip-ons then you can

5546
03:20:16,879 --> 03:20:22,879
use a bow tie i used to work

5547
03:20:18,959 --> 03:20:25,119
for years with uh in hip-hop clubs with

5548
03:20:22,879 --> 03:20:26,079
uh members of the nation of islam

5549
03:20:25,120 --> 03:20:28,079
security team

5550
03:20:26,079 --> 03:20:29,439
that were known they had various

5551
03:20:28,079 --> 03:20:31,200
factions but the one i worked with

5552
03:20:29,439 --> 03:20:33,120
with the x-men and they would always

5553
03:20:31,200 --> 03:20:34,000
wear bow ties which of course can't be

5554
03:20:33,120 --> 03:20:37,520
grabbed

5555
03:20:34,000 --> 03:20:37,520
now um

5556
03:20:37,760 --> 03:20:41,680
the bow tie was that was a recognizable

5557
03:20:39,760 --> 03:20:42,000
part of their brand a security guard so

5558
03:20:41,680 --> 03:20:44,398
everyone

5559
03:20:42,000 --> 03:20:45,760
knew that that's what they were if if i

5560
03:20:44,398 --> 03:20:47,278
wore a bow tie

5561
03:20:45,760 --> 03:20:48,639
and a security situation people would

5562
03:20:47,279 --> 03:20:49,840
probably think that i was some kind of

5563
03:20:48,639 --> 03:20:52,799
nancy boy

5564
03:20:49,840 --> 03:20:53,760
and um uh and want to fight with me so i

5565
03:20:52,799 --> 03:20:57,278
couldn't wear one

5566
03:20:53,760 --> 03:21:00,000
so i would always wear a tie which you

5567
03:20:57,279 --> 03:21:01,359
should become familiar with mr freeman

5568
03:21:00,000 --> 03:21:04,238
that's the texas

5569
03:21:01,359 --> 03:21:04,800
bolo tie which is a kind of shoestring

5570
03:21:04,238 --> 03:21:06,478
tie

5571
03:21:04,799 --> 03:21:08,000
which is very very thin almost like

5572
03:21:06,478 --> 03:21:09,679
shoestring and rather short

5573
03:21:08,000 --> 03:21:11,120
and just has a simple pendant in the

5574
03:21:09,680 --> 03:21:12,880
middle um

5575
03:21:11,120 --> 03:21:14,399
this is perfect if you need to wear a

5576
03:21:12,879 --> 03:21:15,119
tie in a situation where you believe

5577
03:21:14,398 --> 03:21:17,760
there's a

5578
03:21:15,120 --> 03:21:19,120
high likelihood of you being grabbed

5579
03:21:17,760 --> 03:21:20,478
because it can't be grabbed yeah there's

5580
03:21:19,120 --> 03:21:21,439
nothing to grab it's literally like

5581
03:21:20,478 --> 03:21:22,799
string like if

5582
03:21:21,439 --> 03:21:24,800
if you pulled it it would just slip

5583
03:21:22,799 --> 03:21:26,719
through your hand um that tie that

5584
03:21:24,799 --> 03:21:28,559
you're wearing now

5585
03:21:26,719 --> 03:21:30,478
that would give me tremendous control of

5586
03:21:28,559 --> 03:21:32,159
your head and

5587
03:21:30,478 --> 03:21:33,679
i could easily turn into a hockey fight

5588
03:21:32,159 --> 03:21:35,279
situation where your head was being

5589
03:21:33,680 --> 03:21:36,840
pulled down out of balance

5590
03:21:35,279 --> 03:21:38,560
and you would have a hard time

5591
03:21:36,840 --> 03:21:41,680
recovering

5592
03:21:38,559 --> 03:21:44,959
so strangulation not really a problem

5593
03:21:41,680 --> 03:21:48,318
getting pulled down possible problem

5594
03:21:44,959 --> 03:21:49,438
solutions clip-on tie bow tie

5595
03:21:48,318 --> 03:21:52,559
or if you don't want to look like a

5596
03:21:49,439 --> 03:21:55,200
nancy boy wear

5597
03:21:52,559 --> 03:21:56,719
a bolo tie beautiful so you disagree

5598
03:21:55,200 --> 03:21:58,159
with joe rogan and agree with george st

5599
03:21:56,719 --> 03:22:00,000
pierre i love it

5600
03:21:58,159 --> 03:22:02,238
i feel like with i feel like this is an

5601
03:22:00,000 --> 03:22:06,159
instruction we put together here

5602
03:22:02,238 --> 03:22:10,238
on uh on street fighting it and the tie

5603
03:22:06,159 --> 03:22:12,639
speaking of joe rogan let me ask um

5604
03:22:10,238 --> 03:22:16,639
the following question he's uh currently

5605
03:22:12,639 --> 03:22:19,920
doing a podcast with gordon ryan

5606
03:22:16,639 --> 03:22:20,318
and probably going to try to convince

5607
03:22:19,920 --> 03:22:22,159
him

5608
03:22:20,318 --> 03:22:25,119
and you as he's already been doing to

5609
03:22:22,159 --> 03:22:28,398
move to austin what are the chances

5610
03:22:25,120 --> 03:22:30,880
of the donahue death squad coming in

5611
03:22:28,398 --> 03:22:32,559
to austin and opening a school in austin

5612
03:22:30,879 --> 03:22:34,719
and making austin home

5613
03:22:32,559 --> 03:22:36,079
so i can attend the classes there i

5614
03:22:34,719 --> 03:22:36,799
would definitely have to think about

5615
03:22:36,079 --> 03:22:40,639
that

5616
03:22:36,799 --> 03:22:45,119
um i do know that

5617
03:22:40,639 --> 03:22:47,439
i personally love new york yes but

5618
03:22:45,120 --> 03:22:49,120
every single person in the squad

5619
03:22:47,439 --> 03:22:52,238
despised new york

5620
03:22:49,120 --> 03:22:55,520
and wanted to leave for a long time so

5621
03:22:52,238 --> 03:22:56,799
um uh what was the nature of your love

5622
03:22:55,520 --> 03:22:59,040
for new york by the way

5623
03:22:56,799 --> 03:23:01,358
uh it was truly an international city

5624
03:22:59,040 --> 03:23:04,960
like i'm a big believer in the idea of

5625
03:23:01,359 --> 03:23:07,439
of breadth of experience and

5626
03:23:04,959 --> 03:23:09,839
if you want breadth of experience

5627
03:23:07,439 --> 03:23:12,800
usually requires extensive travel

5628
03:23:09,840 --> 03:23:14,159
but training people means you have to be

5629
03:23:12,799 --> 03:23:17,679
in a fixed location

5630
03:23:14,159 --> 03:23:21,039
working according to a schedule and

5631
03:23:17,680 --> 03:23:22,960
that pushed those two push in different

5632
03:23:21,040 --> 03:23:23,840
directions new york was the compromise

5633
03:23:22,959 --> 03:23:25,839
where

5634
03:23:23,840 --> 03:23:27,840
everyone from around the world came

5635
03:23:25,840 --> 03:23:29,040
there so you had breadth of experience

5636
03:23:27,840 --> 03:23:30,478
of world culture

5637
03:23:29,040 --> 03:23:32,399
but at the same time you had a fixed

5638
03:23:30,478 --> 03:23:34,318
location so you could run a training

5639
03:23:32,398 --> 03:23:37,439
program that produced world champions

5640
03:23:34,318 --> 03:23:40,079
so it was the ideal compromise um

5641
03:23:37,439 --> 03:23:42,079
it was a fascinating thing to teach

5642
03:23:40,079 --> 03:23:43,600
classes of over 120 people where

5643
03:23:42,079 --> 03:23:45,200
literally the entire world was

5644
03:23:43,600 --> 03:23:48,720
represented on the map

5645
03:23:45,200 --> 03:23:51,840
and go outside and see the same thing

5646
03:23:48,719 --> 03:23:54,079
it was truly uh

5647
03:23:51,840 --> 03:23:54,880
the world's leading international city

5648
03:23:54,079 --> 03:23:58,000
it was

5649
03:23:54,879 --> 03:24:00,959
um it was like the world's unofficial

5650
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:03,120
capital a fascinating place to live so

5651
03:24:00,959 --> 03:24:05,199
um i loved it but the squad hated it for

5652
03:24:03,120 --> 03:24:08,239
them it was like an expensive

5653
03:24:05,200 --> 03:24:09,600
um things they never actually lived in

5654
03:24:08,238 --> 03:24:11,439
manhattan they always lived in

5655
03:24:09,600 --> 03:24:13,040
new jersey or long island had to commute

5656
03:24:11,439 --> 03:24:14,000
in so all they ever saw was the bridges

5657
03:24:13,040 --> 03:24:16,800
and the tunnels

5658
03:24:14,000 --> 03:24:18,799
the expensive daily parking fee so they

5659
03:24:16,799 --> 03:24:21,840
only saw the worst of new york

5660
03:24:18,799 --> 03:24:23,599
and um despite my pleas for them to move

5661
03:24:21,840 --> 03:24:26,238
into manhattan they never did

5662
03:24:23,600 --> 03:24:27,520
and so they they hated it they because

5663
03:24:26,238 --> 03:24:28,799
when all you see of new york is the

5664
03:24:27,520 --> 03:24:31,600
bridges and the tunnels and

5665
03:24:28,799 --> 03:24:32,799
yeah the the parking garage that's not a

5666
03:24:31,600 --> 03:24:34,640
pleasant thing

5667
03:24:32,799 --> 03:24:35,920
so um i understand where they're coming

5668
03:24:34,639 --> 03:24:39,278
from so

5669
03:24:35,920 --> 03:24:42,318
uh then when covert broke out um

5670
03:24:39,279 --> 03:24:45,680
uh they wanted to to move to puerto rico

5671
03:24:42,318 --> 03:24:47,519
and uh and and work there

5672
03:24:45,680 --> 03:24:50,079
now puerto rico is a beautiful

5673
03:24:47,520 --> 03:24:52,399
alternative to new york it's

5674
03:24:50,079 --> 03:24:54,159
in many ways has many advantages over

5675
03:24:52,398 --> 03:24:57,199
new york it's physically beautiful the

5676
03:24:54,159 --> 03:25:00,478
the uh the people are wonderful and um

5677
03:24:57,200 --> 03:25:02,079
uh it's it's a it's a just a wonderful

5678
03:25:00,478 --> 03:25:05,119
place to spend time

5679
03:25:02,079 --> 03:25:07,039
um freedom low taxes

5680
03:25:05,120 --> 03:25:08,160
all those kinds of things that's puerto

5681
03:25:07,040 --> 03:25:10,640
rico stands for yeah

5682
03:25:08,159 --> 03:25:12,079
it's uh texas on the other hand i know

5683
03:25:10,639 --> 03:25:14,159
everyone in the compromise right

5684
03:25:12,079 --> 03:25:16,238
texas is a compromise between those two

5685
03:25:14,159 --> 03:25:19,200
actually i must say that everyone

5686
03:25:16,238 --> 03:25:20,318
on the squad myself included loves texas

5687
03:25:19,200 --> 03:25:21,840
i

5688
03:25:20,318 --> 03:25:23,920
that there's no question about that i

5689
03:25:21,840 --> 03:25:27,120
know um gordon loves it

5690
03:25:23,920 --> 03:25:29,120
uh gary uh craig nikki that

5691
03:25:27,120 --> 03:25:32,560
everyone who comes here just loves texas

5692
03:25:29,120 --> 03:25:36,319
this that is incontestable

5693
03:25:32,559 --> 03:25:39,680
um of course in texas there's uh

5694
03:25:36,318 --> 03:25:41,600
many great cities austin has uh uh

5695
03:25:39,680 --> 03:25:43,359
always been one of my favorites i've i

5696
03:25:41,600 --> 03:25:47,200
love dallas i love austin

5697
03:25:43,359 --> 03:25:50,720
um and uh it has

5698
03:25:47,200 --> 03:25:54,000
the advantages of better infrastructure

5699
03:25:50,719 --> 03:25:55,438
as a place to train it has a much higher

5700
03:25:54,000 --> 03:25:57,600
population density

5701
03:25:55,439 --> 03:25:59,359
so that you could get a larger number of

5702
03:25:57,600 --> 03:26:00,399
prospective students and form a larger

5703
03:25:59,359 --> 03:26:04,079
squad

5704
03:26:00,398 --> 03:26:07,119
um it would uh it would definitely be a

5705
03:26:04,079 --> 03:26:09,359
fantastic place to to open up a gym

5706
03:26:07,120 --> 03:26:10,560
um i couldn't give an answer off the top

5707
03:26:09,359 --> 03:26:14,079
of my head it would be a big

5708
03:26:10,559 --> 03:26:18,079
move if we did make that move uh but

5709
03:26:14,079 --> 03:26:19,279
the the basic idea would be very

5710
03:26:18,079 --> 03:26:22,478
agreeable to everyone

5711
03:26:19,279 --> 03:26:22,479
on the team i will say that

5712
03:26:22,559 --> 03:26:26,318
well i'll just have to call my russian

5713
03:26:24,559 --> 03:26:26,879
connections to threaten the right kind

5714
03:26:26,318 --> 03:26:30,318
of people

5715
03:26:26,879 --> 03:26:32,639
and uh i definitely would love

5716
03:26:30,318 --> 03:26:34,318
the way you approach training the way

5717
03:26:32,639 --> 03:26:37,680
you approach the martial arts is

5718
03:26:34,318 --> 03:26:38,559
uh is something that's uh that i deeply

5719
03:26:37,680 --> 03:26:40,880
admire

5720
03:26:38,559 --> 03:26:42,398
as a scholar of these arts so it would

5721
03:26:40,879 --> 03:26:44,478
be amazing if you do come here

5722
03:26:42,398 --> 03:26:45,680
but either way it'd be amazing to train

5723
03:26:44,478 --> 03:26:49,438
together

5724
03:26:45,680 --> 03:26:49,439
let me ask a big ridiculous question

5725
03:26:50,559 --> 03:26:54,079
what do you think is the meaning of this

5726
03:26:52,079 --> 03:26:55,680
whole thing we talked about

5727
03:26:54,079 --> 03:26:57,840
at the beginning of the conversation

5728
03:26:55,680 --> 03:27:01,359
about death

5729
03:26:57,840 --> 03:27:03,040
and the fear of it the other big

5730
03:27:01,359 --> 03:27:04,159
question we ask about life is its

5731
03:27:03,040 --> 03:27:06,160
meaning

5732
03:27:04,159 --> 03:27:08,159
do you think there's a meaning to our

5733
03:27:06,159 --> 03:27:11,279
existence here on this little

5734
03:27:08,159 --> 03:27:13,039
spinning ball that's uh you

5735
03:27:11,279 --> 03:27:16,399
you've thrown some some powerful

5736
03:27:13,040 --> 03:27:16,399
questions that's the most powerful

5737
03:27:17,600 --> 03:27:19,920
um

5738
03:27:21,359 --> 03:27:28,399
for most of human existence

5739
03:27:24,398 --> 03:27:32,879
the meaning of life was very very simple

5740
03:27:28,398 --> 03:27:34,639
survival the only

5741
03:27:32,879 --> 03:27:36,079
thing that humans cared about was just

5742
03:27:34,639 --> 03:27:39,278
surviving because it was

5743
03:27:36,079 --> 03:27:43,680
so damn difficult for the early years of

5744
03:27:39,279 --> 03:27:47,680
human existence on this earth

5745
03:27:43,680 --> 03:27:50,720
if you look at ourselves as biological

5746
03:27:47,680 --> 03:27:51,920
agents everything about our body is set

5747
03:27:50,719 --> 03:27:55,039
up for one mission

5748
03:27:51,920 --> 03:27:56,159
and that is survival every reflex we

5749
03:27:55,040 --> 03:27:59,120
have every

5750
03:27:56,159 --> 03:27:59,840
element of our uh structure is just

5751
03:27:59,120 --> 03:28:03,040
built up on

5752
03:27:59,840 --> 03:28:03,040
the battle to survive

5753
03:28:03,200 --> 03:28:07,040
and then humans did something remarkable

5754
03:28:08,000 --> 03:28:12,079
they elevated themselves through the use

5755
03:28:11,279 --> 03:28:15,439
of

5756
03:28:12,079 --> 03:28:18,478
technology and social structure

5757
03:28:15,439 --> 03:28:22,238
to the top of the food chain

5758
03:28:18,478 --> 03:28:24,879
so that they went from extraordinary

5759
03:28:22,238 --> 03:28:26,079
extremely vulnerable if you take a a

5760
03:28:24,879 --> 03:28:28,318
naked human being

5761
03:28:26,079 --> 03:28:30,318
alone and put them in the serengeti

5762
03:28:28,318 --> 03:28:32,639
plains in africa

5763
03:28:30,318 --> 03:28:34,159
they're in some deep [ __ ] okay if you

5764
03:28:32,639 --> 03:28:36,959
look at a human being

5765
03:28:34,159 --> 03:28:38,879
as a survival organism just by itself

5766
03:28:36,959 --> 03:28:42,238
naked

5767
03:28:38,879 --> 03:28:46,238
they are among the most feeble at that

5768
03:28:42,238 --> 03:28:46,238
task in the entire animal kingdom

5769
03:28:49,200 --> 03:28:55,600
you compare us with predatory animals

5770
03:28:52,398 --> 03:28:58,879
we are weak and soft

5771
03:28:55,600 --> 03:28:58,880
and easily killed

5772
03:28:59,920 --> 03:29:04,639
but if you take that same human and put

5773
03:29:02,879 --> 03:29:10,000
them in a group

5774
03:29:04,639 --> 03:29:10,000
and you give him basic technology steel

5775
03:29:10,159 --> 03:29:15,760
a spear a knife

5776
03:29:14,238 --> 03:29:17,279
he goes from the bottom of the food

5777
03:29:15,760 --> 03:29:20,800
chain

5778
03:29:17,279 --> 03:29:24,238
to pretty much at the top

5779
03:29:20,799 --> 03:29:26,959
and so humanity found itself

5780
03:29:24,238 --> 03:29:28,559
in a crisis that emerged out of its own

5781
03:29:26,959 --> 03:29:30,879
success

5782
03:29:28,559 --> 03:29:32,398
for most of its history their only

5783
03:29:30,879 --> 03:29:32,719
interest was the battle to survive and

5784
03:29:32,398 --> 03:29:34,318
they

5785
03:29:32,719 --> 03:29:35,599
they did it i don't know how they did it

5786
03:29:34,318 --> 03:29:36,559
but they did it they got through ice

5787
03:29:35,600 --> 03:29:39,840
ages

5788
03:29:36,559 --> 03:29:41,439
droughts famines disease everything

5789
03:29:39,840 --> 03:29:44,159
and they found a way to get to the top

5790
03:29:41,439 --> 03:29:44,159
of the food chain

5791
03:29:44,238 --> 03:29:49,920
and that's where it all got interesting

5792
03:29:47,600 --> 03:29:51,120
because an organism whose only interest

5793
03:29:49,920 --> 03:29:53,040
was in survival

5794
03:29:51,120 --> 03:29:55,279
yeah had for the first time in their

5795
03:29:53,040 --> 03:29:58,560
history a more or less

5796
03:29:55,279 --> 03:29:58,560
guaranteed survival

5797
03:29:59,279 --> 03:30:06,319
and so the big question now is now what

5798
03:30:03,439 --> 03:30:07,279
we survived there's no more danger the

5799
03:30:06,318 --> 03:30:09,600
average human being

5800
03:30:07,279 --> 03:30:11,200
finds himself in a world now where

5801
03:30:09,600 --> 03:30:15,120
there's almost

5802
03:30:11,200 --> 03:30:18,640
zero danger from predatory animals where

5803
03:30:15,120 --> 03:30:21,760
getting a meal is the easiest thing ever

5804
03:30:18,639 --> 03:30:23,599
where getting to and from work is not

5805
03:30:21,760 --> 03:30:26,880
problematic at all

5806
03:30:23,600 --> 03:30:28,800
where the majority of infectious

5807
03:30:26,879 --> 03:30:31,438
diseases

5808
03:30:28,799 --> 03:30:32,159
medical complaints can be resolved in a

5809
03:30:31,439 --> 03:30:34,960
hospital

5810
03:30:32,159 --> 03:30:34,959
fairly easily

5811
03:30:35,760 --> 03:30:39,200
and so they start casting their mind

5812
03:30:37,439 --> 03:30:42,800
around okay

5813
03:30:39,200 --> 03:30:45,920
what do i do now and so

5814
03:30:42,799 --> 03:30:50,398
the minute mankind's

5815
03:30:45,920 --> 03:30:54,159
existence became more or less guaranteed

5816
03:30:50,398 --> 03:30:57,439
the problems shift from survival

5817
03:30:54,159 --> 03:30:58,959
to meaning and we found ourselves

5818
03:30:57,439 --> 03:31:01,279
grappling

5819
03:30:58,959 --> 03:31:04,238
with a whole new issue that had never

5820
03:31:01,279 --> 03:31:06,800
occurred to our ancient forefathers

5821
03:31:04,238 --> 03:31:10,398
but which now becomes one of the

5822
03:31:06,799 --> 03:31:12,639
centerpieces of our modern lives

5823
03:31:10,398 --> 03:31:14,799
i mean when you look at your own life

5824
03:31:12,639 --> 03:31:18,318
when you look back

5825
03:31:14,799 --> 03:31:20,238
you think i did a hell of a good job

5826
03:31:18,318 --> 03:31:23,039
you know uh hunter thompson has this

5827
03:31:20,238 --> 03:31:24,719
line that i often think about

5828
03:31:23,040 --> 03:31:27,279
that life should not be a journey to the

5829
03:31:24,719 --> 03:31:29,920
grave with the intention of arriving

5830
03:31:27,279 --> 03:31:30,720
safely in a pretty and well-preserved

5831
03:31:29,920 --> 03:31:33,680
body

5832
03:31:30,719 --> 03:31:35,199
but rather to skid in roadside in a

5833
03:31:33,680 --> 03:31:37,520
cloud of smoke

5834
03:31:35,200 --> 03:31:38,640
thoroughly used up totally worn out and

5835
03:31:37,520 --> 03:31:42,640
loudly proclaiming

5836
03:31:38,639 --> 03:31:43,119
wow what a ride that's which is the

5837
03:31:42,639 --> 03:31:46,639
complete

5838
03:31:43,120 --> 03:31:48,640
opposite of survival well not complete

5839
03:31:46,639 --> 03:31:50,238
opposite of survival but basically

5840
03:31:48,639 --> 03:31:53,439
embracing danger

5841
03:31:50,238 --> 03:31:56,799
embracing risk going big just

5842
03:31:53,439 --> 03:31:59,680
living life to the fullest so within

5843
03:31:56,799 --> 03:31:59,679
that context

5844
03:31:59,840 --> 03:32:03,920
what would make you proud of a life well

5845
03:32:03,359 --> 03:32:05,760
lived

5846
03:32:03,920 --> 03:32:07,760
when you look back you john donahue

5847
03:32:05,760 --> 03:32:09,760
looking back at your life

5848
03:32:07,760 --> 03:32:11,040
first i will address that question but

5849
03:32:09,760 --> 03:32:13,760
let's first look at

5850
03:32:11,040 --> 03:32:15,279
why hunter thompson could say that

5851
03:32:13,760 --> 03:32:17,120
because his life was more or less

5852
03:32:15,279 --> 03:32:18,640
guaranteed and safe

5853
03:32:17,120 --> 03:32:21,120
if you look at animals in the animal

5854
03:32:18,639 --> 03:32:22,000
kingdom the pattern of their life is

5855
03:32:21,120 --> 03:32:24,239
very simple

5856
03:32:22,000 --> 03:32:26,000
they take the least risk possible to

5857
03:32:24,238 --> 03:32:28,959
secure their existence

5858
03:32:26,000 --> 03:32:31,040
lions are powerful creatures but when

5859
03:32:28,959 --> 03:32:32,879
they go hunting they typically go for

5860
03:32:31,040 --> 03:32:34,160
the weakest animals they can kill in

5861
03:32:32,879 --> 03:32:36,159
order to eat because they don't want to

5862
03:32:34,159 --> 03:32:38,719
take the risk of injuring themselves

5863
03:32:36,159 --> 03:32:40,398
knowing that if they do they die so the

5864
03:32:38,719 --> 03:32:41,679
brute reality is

5865
03:32:40,398 --> 03:32:44,079
the only people who can talk about

5866
03:32:41,680 --> 03:32:44,079
having

5867
03:32:44,478 --> 03:32:48,719
casual danger in their lives are those

5868
03:32:47,120 --> 03:32:51,760
whose lives are guaranteed

5869
03:32:48,719 --> 03:32:54,398
and a fascinating small tangent hunters

5870
03:32:51,760 --> 03:32:56,880
thompson took his own life

5871
03:32:54,398 --> 03:32:58,079
so that's that seems like a deeply human

5872
03:32:56,879 --> 03:33:02,079
thing to suicide

5873
03:32:58,079 --> 03:33:03,200
yes um that's a fascinating question in

5874
03:33:02,079 --> 03:33:05,600
itself

5875
03:33:03,200 --> 03:33:07,359
if you look at the the number of

5876
03:33:05,600 --> 03:33:09,359
suicides per year it's a

5877
03:33:07,359 --> 03:33:11,040
shocking shocking statistic that gets

5878
03:33:09,359 --> 03:33:14,079
almost no recognition

5879
03:33:11,040 --> 03:33:16,319
and yes uniquely human you don't

5880
03:33:14,079 --> 03:33:17,840
very very few animals you see killing

5881
03:33:16,318 --> 03:33:18,799
themselves because their whole thing is

5882
03:33:17,840 --> 03:33:20,799
just survival

5883
03:33:18,799 --> 03:33:22,639
and that humans paradoxically when

5884
03:33:20,799 --> 03:33:24,559
survival is more or less guaranteed are

5885
03:33:22,639 --> 03:33:27,680
killing themselves in vast numbers

5886
03:33:24,559 --> 03:33:29,680
it's usually linked back to the idea of

5887
03:33:27,680 --> 03:33:33,359
meaning because it's so hard

5888
03:33:29,680 --> 03:33:34,559
it's it was hard to win the battle for

5889
03:33:33,359 --> 03:33:36,399
survival

5890
03:33:34,559 --> 03:33:38,719
but it's ten times harder to win the

5891
03:33:36,398 --> 03:33:41,039
battle for meaning

5892
03:33:38,719 --> 03:33:41,039
um

5893
03:33:42,959 --> 03:33:46,719
when i think about it first off i'll say

5894
03:33:46,000 --> 03:33:50,559
right from the back

5895
03:33:46,719 --> 03:33:53,679
there's never going to be an agreed upon

5896
03:33:50,559 --> 03:33:55,920
sense of meaning there's

5897
03:33:53,680 --> 03:33:57,840
as i said there was one thing that our

5898
03:33:55,920 --> 03:34:00,398
our physical bodies agreed upon

5899
03:33:57,840 --> 03:34:01,680
and which is hardwired biologically into

5900
03:34:00,398 --> 03:34:03,680
us and that's survival

5901
03:34:01,680 --> 03:34:04,880
but once we got to a more or less

5902
03:34:03,680 --> 03:34:08,079
guaranteed survival

5903
03:34:04,879 --> 03:34:10,238
then all bets were off at that point

5904
03:34:08,079 --> 03:34:11,840
you just have to start listing your own

5905
03:34:10,238 --> 03:34:13,600
criteria and what one person will

5906
03:34:11,840 --> 03:34:14,478
describe as a meaningful life another

5907
03:34:13,600 --> 03:34:17,680
person will

5908
03:34:14,478 --> 03:34:19,920
decry as is meaningless or wasted

5909
03:34:17,680 --> 03:34:19,920
um

5910
03:34:21,760 --> 03:34:25,439
there's something terrible about the

5911
03:34:24,398 --> 03:34:27,119
idea that we're

5912
03:34:25,439 --> 03:34:29,120
sitting around you know waiting for

5913
03:34:27,120 --> 03:34:31,040
meaning to show up on our doorstep

5914
03:34:29,120 --> 03:34:32,960
but what i find the best people do is

5915
03:34:31,040 --> 03:34:35,359
they take charge of it and they

5916
03:34:32,959 --> 03:34:36,879
look at their lives and in a form of

5917
03:34:35,359 --> 03:34:39,920
authorship

5918
03:34:36,879 --> 03:34:43,278
where they see their life as a tale

5919
03:34:39,920 --> 03:34:44,960
to be written and they do their best

5920
03:34:43,279 --> 03:34:46,880
to write that tale and put as much

5921
03:34:44,959 --> 03:34:51,358
control over the

5922
03:34:46,879 --> 03:34:51,358
the direction of this story as they can

5923
03:34:52,478 --> 03:34:56,079
in the end we all have to just try and

5924
03:34:55,439 --> 03:34:59,200
write our own

5925
03:34:56,079 --> 03:35:00,799
story we all have our own interests i

5926
03:34:59,200 --> 03:35:04,239
try

5927
03:35:00,799 --> 03:35:05,119
to bring in the sense that even though

5928
03:35:04,238 --> 03:35:07,840
i'm

5929
03:35:05,120 --> 03:35:08,160
an atheist i don't believe that we go on

5930
03:35:07,840 --> 03:35:10,559
to

5931
03:35:08,159 --> 03:35:12,238
to live after this i'm i i believe that

5932
03:35:10,559 --> 03:35:14,398
there's a possibility

5933
03:35:12,238 --> 03:35:15,439
of a god and afterlife i don't say it's

5934
03:35:14,398 --> 03:35:18,000
impossible

5935
03:35:15,439 --> 03:35:19,520
but in order for me to believe that they

5936
03:35:18,000 --> 03:35:20,478
exist i'd have to see better evidence

5937
03:35:19,520 --> 03:35:24,720
than i see

5938
03:35:20,478 --> 03:35:27,358
currently nonetheless i do believe

5939
03:35:24,719 --> 03:35:27,840
that there is a great value in the idea

5940
03:35:27,359 --> 03:35:29,600
of

5941
03:35:27,840 --> 03:35:31,120
living for something bigger than

5942
03:35:29,600 --> 03:35:34,238
yourself

5943
03:35:31,120 --> 03:35:36,560
the moment you see yourself as the be

5944
03:35:34,238 --> 03:35:38,079
all and end all of your existence you're

5945
03:35:36,559 --> 03:35:40,238
in for a meaningless life

5946
03:35:38,079 --> 03:35:41,600
and nothing will ever satisfy you you

5947
03:35:40,238 --> 03:35:42,719
can have all the money in the world you

5948
03:35:41,600 --> 03:35:44,960
can have all the power in the world

5949
03:35:42,719 --> 03:35:48,238
you'll be empty inside

5950
03:35:44,959 --> 03:35:52,318
i do believe that humans have a deep

5951
03:35:48,238 --> 03:35:54,799
and abiding need to follow

5952
03:35:52,318 --> 03:35:57,439
the interests of a group bigger than

5953
03:35:54,799 --> 03:36:00,159
themselves as an individual

5954
03:35:57,439 --> 03:36:01,279
is it ideal no is it an answer to the

5955
03:36:00,159 --> 03:36:02,639
meaning of life nope

5956
03:36:01,279 --> 03:36:04,479
because eventually that group will

5957
03:36:02,639 --> 03:36:05,760
itself die out so there's a sense in

5958
03:36:04,478 --> 03:36:09,599
which it

5959
03:36:05,760 --> 03:36:09,600
that just plays a kind of delaying game

5960
03:36:10,799 --> 03:36:17,840
but i do believe that in order to live

5961
03:36:14,398 --> 03:36:19,680
a happy life meaning

5962
03:36:17,840 --> 03:36:21,120
as a central part of that and the

5963
03:36:19,680 --> 03:36:24,398
deepest sense of meaning

5964
03:36:21,120 --> 03:36:26,160
not a fully complete answer but a better

5965
03:36:24,398 --> 03:36:30,159
answer than most people give us to

5966
03:36:26,159 --> 03:36:32,238
to find something which hopefully does

5967
03:36:30,159 --> 03:36:34,639
very little harm to the people around

5968
03:36:32,238 --> 03:36:36,959
you and mostly benefits them

5969
03:36:34,639 --> 03:36:38,398
which enables you to become part of a

5970
03:36:36,959 --> 03:36:42,478
community

5971
03:36:38,398 --> 03:36:46,559
and to live as i said for something

5972
03:36:42,478 --> 03:36:46,559
larger than than you as an individual

5973
03:36:46,879 --> 03:36:50,079
if there is such a thing as the perfect

5974
03:36:48,719 --> 03:36:53,199
conversation

5975
03:36:50,079 --> 03:36:56,799
it would be a conversation on

5976
03:36:53,200 --> 03:36:59,760
death meaning and robots

5977
03:36:56,799 --> 03:37:01,438

5978
03:36:59,760 --> 03:37:03,359

support this podcast

5989
03:37:19,120 --> 03:37:23,520
and now let me leave you some words from

5990
03:37:21,439 --> 03:37:25,760
john donahue himself

5991
03:37:23,520 --> 03:37:27,680
in fighting and competition the

5992
03:37:25,760 --> 03:37:30,238
objective is victory

5993
03:37:27,680 --> 03:37:31,120
in training the objective is skill

5994
03:37:30,238 --> 03:37:33,920
development

5995
03:37:31,120 --> 03:37:35,120
do not confuse them as such one of the

5996
03:37:33,920 --> 03:37:37,120
best ways to train

5997
03:37:35,120 --> 03:37:38,479
is to identify the strengths of your

5998
03:37:37,120 --> 03:37:40,880
various partners

5999
03:37:38,478 --> 03:37:42,398
and regularly expose yourself to those

6000
03:37:40,879 --> 03:37:43,839
strengths

6001
03:37:42,398 --> 03:37:55,680
thank you for listening and hope to see

6002
03:37:43,840 --> 03:37:55,680
you next time
