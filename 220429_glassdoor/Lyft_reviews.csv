1,Community Associate - Contractor,True,Nothing. You don't exist as a contractor. Maybe the free lunch is a pro but that is about it. A laptop....,Everything. As a contractor you do not even have access to company's announcements. You do not exist. They expect the best from you and you are paid peanuts with the non existent possibility to become an internal employee of the company. It is absolutely awful. Drivers have countless issues and you have absolutely ZERO room for growth.
3,Software Engineer,True,"Good work-life balance.

Some very smart people in the company.",job advancement and financial compensation. Traffic and office location
4,"People are great, fun environment, weak HR",True,"The people are incredible, and the main reason to be in the office. With a handful of exceptions, everyone is smart, caring, and wants the company to succeed. It is a very open culture with blameless incident review process within Engingeering.",It can be a hard place to navigate and move up if you don't have a good manager (I don't). HR is fairly useless if you want to switch teams and are being roadblocked by your manager. Recruiting is also extremely understaffed and not very effective at getting talent through the pipeline. Compensation across the org is a bit low.
5,Best Company to Work for,True,Lyft practices the lofty goals it aims for on a daily basis.  Employees are some of the smartest in the business,Fast paced environment can lead to unclear expectations
5,Software Engineer,True,"The most friendly and rewarding working experience I've ever had! 

I had the opportunity to work on exciting projects.

I collaborated with top engineers and designers in the field.

My work had a big impact.

Competitive salary and perks.

Awesome office space.","If I had to pick one, it might be that everything is moving and changing very quickly due to Lyft's incredible growth."
1,Express Drive Community Associate,True,"Resume builder for someone who has never worked in the startup industry. 



Introduction to how chaotic a fancy looking startup company really is and the disorganization that keeps them running.



Google Doc proficiency will sky rocket.","Express Drive Community Associate job title should be changed to ""Lyft Express Drive Human Punching Bag Associate"", due to the amount of emotional and mental abuse that a CA experiences during their underpaid, 8 hours shift in the field. After working in the Service industry for almost 18 years, I have never felt more physically threatened by customers/drivers than I did while working in this position. Express Drive is the last resort for the majority of its participants to obtain a vehicle. All is required is a drivers license, $250 deposit and a cleanish DMV/Criminal background check.



Lyft hides behind the guise that their drivers are ""Contract Workers"" and therefore the CAs in the field are unable to refuse service to any of them. Countless times I was screamed at, physically intimidated, disrespected and generally harassed by the drivers, with little or no support from my managers. Managers were hesitant to ban drivers from using the Lyft platform, even after the drivers had displayed mentally unstable or malicious behavior towards CAs.



If you are researching any CONTRACT positions working for the Lyft company, I strongly recommend applying elsewhere. Find a company that actually values their hardworking contract workers and have a plan/set time period for contract to hire. Lyft strings their contract workers along for an undetermined amount of time for full time hiring. Not uncommon for contract CAs to be in a contract position for over a year before becoming full time. The top pay for the position ($18/hr) is laughable for the SF Bay Area and 99% of the contract CAs also drive for Lyft, on top of putting in 40 hours of fielding a nonstop barrage of disrespectful drivers.



Lastly, there is a major disconnect between ""Full-Time"" Lyft employees and ""Contract"" workers. When in the main Operations Hub it could be interpreted that the Full-Time employees view the Contract folks as inferior or just ""the hired help"". Not a very welcoming environment. I would encourage the upper Lyft management to provide their Operations Managers and Leads with some serious sensitivity and empathy training.



Overall, don't work in a contract position for Express Drive unless you enjoy an underpaid, degrading, end-of-the-line type of position that will not only ruin your mental health, but your physical health as you consume alcohol or drugs to deal with the stress of it."
3,No transparency,True,"Benefits, Co-workers, Snacks, Catered lunch sometimes, Lyft credits","Upper Management

- not approachable

- not transparent



Popularity contest"
2,Typical Start up Drama,True,"The convienient location downtown

Lax Dress-code (very laxed)

Free Apparel (backpacks,shirts,tumblers,hats etc.)","If you are a minority good luck being treated equally.

Diversity and Inclusion is non existent 

Way to much disparate treatment"
1,Not what it seems,True,pay and benefits are good,"lacks clear direction, inconsistent though out the company"
1,Lyft,True,"Pay, Benefits, Growth, Snacks, Snacks","Management, Environment, Co-Workers, Co-Workers, Management"
5,Open Environment,True,"- Very inclusive and open

- Great medical benefits

- Lyft credits",- Best job I have held!
2,The Potential Is There... But Lyft Falls Short,True,"Energetic, trendy, and friendly atmosphere, lots of growth opportunity (with caveats), excellent benefits and perks (gotta love those office snacks), dog-friendly, wonderful and supportive co-workers, gorgeous office, prime location, company CEO's are pretty transparent about what's going on with the company and goals/risks","Employees are viewed as numbers and productivity stats. They attempt to make the job seem like less of a call center, but the result is counterproductive and detrimental to the work environment. 



While I was there, employees were fired left and right - some of them for issues that came about due to retroactively applied policies (I won't even touch on how ethically reprehensible that is) - and oftentimes without warning even though there was apparent documentation of issues that were never brought to the employee before they were fired. 



I sincerely hope this has changed since I worked there because I've never in my life seen such a high turnover rate, especially since the employees leaving weren't going to other departments or making progressive moves to other companies. It was just firings, and that says a great deal about what kind of company Lyft is. I felt very deceived by the people who hired me after the newness had worn off because I felt like I was pitched a much different work experience than what was actually the reality.



If you have aspirations to grow within the company, there is opportunity to do so provided that you are chummy with upper management. They're nice people (albeit a bit inexperienced, but that goes hand-in-hand with startups), so it's doable, but if one person decides they don't like you, then you're SOL. It's a very cliquey atmosphere, and dedication and hard work will not guarantee upward mobility (it doesn't hurt though).



Finally, the biggest problem I have with Lyft is that you cannot be yourself while at work unless you are a constantly bubbly, always glass-half-full person who never has anything constructive to say. I'm a positive person by nature, but the people who were successful at Lyft were borderline disingenuine with their hamfisted positivity. I didn't feel like I could trust many people because everyone was so afraid to say anything that wasn't unicorns and glitter rainbows. And surprise, surprise, the employees who did constructively speak up (and I'm not talking outright negativity here; I'm talking about comments like, ""hey, I noticed that we have some grammatical errors on the website/reply templates, I'd be happy to fix those for us or let whoever handles those know they need to be fixed"") were shown the door. 



Truly disheartening because Lyft has the potential to be an absolutely amazing place to work."
5,Software enginner,True,Great lunch. Lyft credits. Friendly atmosphere.,Hours can be long. Need more females in engineering leadership roles.
5,Fantastic Company!  Fast growing yet still feels like a family.,True,"Benefits are great, Perks are fantastic, flexible working conditions.",None that I can think of
5,Startup environment with room to grow and develop your career.,True,"Always new areas of opportunity! As the company grows and develops, so can you. Open and accepting with a great culture.",Competitive and you must stay scrappy. This is not a place where you can coast. Scheduling may be unique as they have multiple departments in which they ask for 24/7 staffing.
5,Ideal Workplace,True,"The people are extremely friendly and authentic

The environment is flexible and ready for action

Love the mission of helping to change the way our world works by imagining a world where cities feel small again.","Nothing at this time, it's a great place all around."
2,Leadership woes prevented us from taking advantage of the #DeleteUber viral campaign,True,"Rapidly growing and well funded. Depending on the team you're on, you have the opportunity to make an impact and grow.



The $200/month in ride credits is a great perk","Horrible office politics and inexperienced leadership plagues the company. Too many managers land grabbing and building empires. Senior leadership consists of inexperienced people, many of which haven't worked anywhere before Lyft. 



Very cheap company in terms of compensation and raises



The CEO and President are nice guys but they're not the leaders you want to march into battle for. They're more concerned about being ""woke"" than building the transportation solution of the future"
1,Bad experience,True,There are no pros to a very unresponsive support staff.,"I have not yet had a chance to drive with Lyft because of an unreasonably long wait during the onboarding process.  I applied for this ridesharde service more than six months ago.  I have received repetitive request to submit information that was previously submitted with no progress.  I was recently contact by the ""help team"" who have recently failed to update me concerning the status of application. Each time I check it simply says ""items under review"" with no clear explanation for why it has taken more than a month to complete a process that should only take 48 hours."
5,Expect to be challenged,True,"Huge experience, training, and start-up culture environment","Goals are high, and the company is very competitive. Must have skills across the board to be successful. Strategy, Analytics, Time Management, Client Relations."
5,Social Media Customer Experience Associate,True,"The work hours are typical 9-5, dog friendly office, fully stocked kitchens, casual work environment, GREAT employees.","The application, interview and overall process is a little long. I applied and finally interviewed a few weeks late and started working two weeks after that. It takes about 1 month from start to finish."
1,Don't believe the hype: it's not the place you want to work,True,Pay is competitive and benefits are generous.  Friday booze (if that's your jam).  Equity is generous and looks like it'll be worth something soon.,"Worst presence and execution of in office politics of any office I've ever worked at.  It's not that things are overtly political and tedious, but that people don't even know how to be political effectively.  It's sort of embarrassing.  Slowest moving tech company I've ever worked at.  The amount of hoops that you have to jump through are similar to large, old companies.  Death by Power Point.  Clandestine culture that's also poorly executed.  People try to do a lot of work in the dark and change org structures in secret, but the secret always gets out, people always get nervous, and the execution is just horrific.  Management is generally weak (although there are good individual contributors).  Lots of people who were good ICs and just happened to be old timers end up in leadership roles even though they are really bad leaders.  This is pretty prevalent in marketing, analytics, operations, and product.  Think of large company process and progress with start up chaos.  Tools are weak.  Inability to focus on most important problems.  For 60% of the teams at Lyft, I could not ever recommend joining."
2,be careful of company mission,True,vision of what  the company should be,not quite there as far as living up to mission
5,Impressive Culture and Team,True,"The culture cannot be beat!  Core values are a way of life and not just something that looks good ""on paper.""  Also, the wellness benefits are offered from day one of employment!","This is not a con for Lyft, but affordable monthly downtown parking is a challenge to locate.  However, Lyft provides employees with parking credits AND Lyft credits which is awesome!  Lyft is not currently available in my area so I am commuting until I can relocate closer to Nashville and, therefore, I cannot take full advantage of these credits (yet)."
4,Ok place,True,Good management team. Good staff,Pay could be better on some days
4,Community Associate,True,"Great company culture, values and benefits.",Difficulty adapting to growth and keeping promises to contract employees.
5,"Excellent perks, experienced teammates, and flexible work life",True,"Amazing lunch + dinner (unlimited guest passing of friends)

Teammates are all highly collaborative and interested in achieving company success

Managers are very hands off, but are still organized about expectations of work to be completed

Flexibility to find and create new projects for the company

New 15' maxed out MBP

Phone bill reimbursement","Not enough Lyft credits for a full monthly commute

I don't have my own desk yet (my manager lent me his)"
5,Couldn't imagine working anywhere else,True,"Incredibly smart people, so much growth potential, super transparent management",Definitely some growing pains but that's expected
5,Happy with my Lyft life,True,"Great leadership

Freedom to innovate

True investment in diversity



Exciting to be a part of a company that is constantly growing and changing!","Local teams are somewhat disconnected from HQ and when things are urgent for us, the urgency doesn't translate to SF at times. There are so many internal processes that are working towards making this experience better, so I hope that they are successful!"
5,Not that bad at all,True,SOme real nice people in there,SOmetimes it seemed like people were fak e
4,My experience as a CA,True,"Lyft as a corporation has very good values and a good heart, which is rare nowadays. They care about their employees. I think if you work for certain branches of the company, your life is great. If you work for others, not so much. I thought the company itself was good overall, the pay was fair, and the benefits were very nice.","My position itself was very difficult to handle day in and out. As a community associate we are yelled at all day by drivers who think everything is our fault. I could only take so much of that for so long. However, I think it wears down even people with the thickest of skin."
5,Customer Support,True,"Lyft is a great place to work. The office is wonderful, the employees are happy, and the benefits are great.","I can't think of any at this time, except maybe if you're looking for a simple 9-5, the hours can vary greatly."
3,"Work hard , no loyalty",True,"benefits, office space and free snacks",cut throat behind the smiles - a lot of work expected for medium pay standards
2,Inequality and favoritism from managers to certain employees,True,"Flexible work environment

co workers are nice","Seniority does not matter.  New people are brought on by managers that know the new hire personally.  Then that new hire gets special treatment and gets favoritism.  Management really doesn't care about your growth unless it will benefit them (getting a promotion).  New hires that know manager come in and act like they are above you and treat you like nothing because of the ""connection"" they have with the manager.  

No benefits they just contract you and use you as they please."
3,Growing Pains,True,"Benefits - free lunch, ride credit, transit","Raises are poor, performance is about who you know."
4,Great place to work temporarily,True,"Great culture, fast paced, exciting, great benefits.",Not very much opportunity for advancement at the Nashville office.
5,Excellent,True,Great customer service for this company.,None that I can think of.
5,Positive Experience!,True,"I was just hired onto Lyft, and very excited for this career. Lyft is so welcoming, positive, and uplifting. They are a DOG FRIENDLY office, so how can you not be happy in that enviorment? Cute dogs, all day long.",None at the moment. Looking like a very positive experience ahead.
5,"Great Company, Great Leadership, Great People",True,Amazing people and culture. John and Logan do a great job of living the brand and exuding passion for their mission. Nothing but great things to say!,"Normal growth issues, they are scaling very fast and teams/environments change rapidly."
5,Great place to work,True,It is a great place to work,I don't have any cons
1,Uber in Pink,True,People bad talk the food but I actually thought it was pretty good. It's fun to tell drivers you work at Lyft.,"I've seen just about everything that Uber gets shamed for happen at Lyft: a focus on maximizing revenue by short-changing drivers, sexual harassment, political decision-making structures that make everything a question of who you kiss up to, pressure to work long hours whether or not its productive, management by adult children. The ""culture"" of Lyft has become a marketing slogan and the founders have made that clear.



Side note: As an outsider looking in, the logical approach now is to slash the regional offices pretty drastically, so I'd avoid taking a Lyft job that's not at HQ."
5,Account Executive,True,"Really cool crew, wish them the best","Tough growing pains, figured it out"
5,Not your typical ride share company.,True,There is great sense of team-work within the company.,Wish Lyft would go international.
5,Great so far!,True,"Great colleagues! Brilliant jerks without the ""jerks"" part.  Rapidly growing and very exciting.",Pre-IPO has some disadvantages - e.g.: stock has no value yet.
5,Great Place To Work!,True,Amazing work life balance. Great pay and your managers are always there to help you grow to become better.,"Small company, growing fast, changes. ( but some may see this as a pro.)"
4,Great company!,True,"Very good culture, enjoyable work, feel like you're making a real impact","Not many... pay is probably not as high as you could find elsewhere, but definitely still a very worthwhile company."
5,Great company with tons of opportunities and great benefits.,True,Highly skilled co-workers and interesting problems.,Poor balance of work time versus personal time.
5,Customer Experience Associate,True,"Great atmosphere, excellent team members, flexable hours and training.",there are none that i have experienced
5,Brand Ambassador,True,"great culture, flexible, traveling, fun","no consistent pay, change of pay structure"
1,Customer Support / Local Team,True,"Good coworkers (On same level) , Free Snacks, Downtown","Poor communication between management and lower level. Underpaid for the amount of time &amp; work put in. Management is against overtime for the local team. Never following through with goals,  Not informed about company changes... (Having to find out details from the public) No formal training for the local team. Not strong enough tools to complete tasks. Many tools are not accurate in reporting information yet are never fixed even though reported multiple times. I felt as though I couldn't do anything without asking management. Even when I did ask management I wasn't given a clear answer and was reprimanded for not giving them what the wanted. I was being watched by big brother every second of every day. The company made business choices around political information that had nothing to do with the company. Many employees and customers were not happy with the choice and left the company.  Lied to during interview about my work hours. ""You may have to work the occasional weekend"" I am writing this review now working 10 weekends in a row. Last second changes as to what needs to be done. Example: After working 6 days in a row a the end of day 6 being asked: ""Hey can you work for an hour tomorrow?"". No consideration for lower employees care."
5,great company,True,good company to work for,may get better but pay is low
4,Lyft Review,True,Great team and management team,Needs better pay and promotion structure
5,Great opportunity,True,"Flexibility, work when you want.","They keep dropping the referral amounts, and they completely eliminated mentoring."
3,No longer a startup,True,"Nice office in South Beach, decent benefits, unlimited PTO, and free meals.",The quality of your experience at Lyft is going to depend mostly on the culture of your team.  Some teams are very cliquey.  Lyft's attorney department is one the biggest teams in the company while other teams are expected to work 24-7 to get all the work done.  Employee distribution needed.
4,Interesting...,True,There some great ideas within the company and the benefits are nice.,Still a fairly new company. Which means things are constantly changing...
3,Good company but stressful job,True,"Great company values and culture, fun office, nice location downtown in the middle of the action, friendly and smart employees, free snacks and drinks, generous healthcare benefits, freely available overtime.","I like the company but don't like the job. Critical response line is extremely stressful as you are constantly dealing with angry passengers and drivers calling the line for any number of issues. There is a chronic shortage of agents even though the company's ridership is growing, meaning that everyone is becoming more burdened and morale is the lowest since I've been here. We're seeing turnover rate increasing as more agents are having difficulty dealing with deluge of stressful calls. This office in Nashville is only around a year and half old so perhaps there are growing pains, but it seems management needs to get on the ball because many pain points that cause this job to be stressful could be solved. Getting promoted from within the company seems near impossible. Pay while probably at about the Nashville average for an entry-level call center job  is still a bit low given the stress level of the job and the rapidly rising cost of living in Nashville."
5,Like it very much,True,"Great work culture, talented people, good work of     balance. Cool working environment. Flexible working time, lunch &amp; snack ... there are so much amazing thing","It would be wonderful if 401K match can be provided,            Large Meeting rooms are not enough, other than that, everything is good"
1,Pitiful,True,"The pay is good

Free food

Bring your dog to work sometimes

Wear what you want","Discriminatory environment

Workloads are never guaranteed

You have to pay to park at your own job"
5,great!,True,awesome place to work. great people.,High competition from competitors like uber
2,Liars!,True,The company has great people.,Management likes to change employees job responsibilities and roles without asking and low wage.
5,Financial Analyst,True,"Fun, hardworking, young employees, In SF","Long hours, No gym memberships"
5,Great place to work,True,Awesome team members!  Everyone helps everyone else out.,Full time only.  No part time positions.
5,Amazing place to work!,True,I've been here for 3 years and witnessed the explosive growth but unwavering commitment to culture/values. Everyone here is driven and results-oriented while being collaborative and kind. I love coming to work every day to tackle the complex and interesting issues we face in our competitive industry. It's nice being the good guy.,I would not apply to Lyft if you can't pivot quickly and operate well in the gray.

~Healthcare is pretty good

~snacks 

~the culture is nice when present","~pay (there are sometimes where I have to drive to stay afloat)

~lack of opportunity for career progression 

~Upper management is not the most diverse in thinking and background.

~walking on eggshells if you have an opinion that differs from management because so many of my coworkers have been fired for voicing theirs."
5,Lyst is awesome!,True,"Relaxed work environment, Smooth interview process, small company feel, personable and room for growth",Open office configuration can be distracting
5,Customer service over night repersentive,True,A lot of cool people,The hours are a lot to mange

Very efficient in their use of technology",I have no cons to date

Management is flexible and considerate 

Company is invested in your career 

Benefit package is amazing","Being based in San Francisco, the Nashville office has to stream team meetings and often have video meetings with team members in other offices. It's not horrible, it can just feel distant."
5,Critical Response Line,True,Great environment. Amazing benefits. I love working there!,Customers yell at you a lot because they called the wrong number and we can't help them.
5,Lyft Customer Experience Team,True,Amazing job at hiring and building a team. Having gone from such a small team to over 300+ people now. Coworkers are amazing.,"Sometimes scheduling can be a bit tricky, but this is a very small issue and really the only thought that comes to mind. Lyft is a great company to work for."
2,Crl,True,"Culture, environment, teammates, insurance and lyft credits",No growth opportunities. TEAM LEADS treat the department like a jail house
3,Outside service coordinator,True,i worked asa a starter for the golf course. Trained new employees and how to open and close the course. i also worked to help organisation tournament.,A hard worker looking for an opportunity to work within environment to add to the positive workforce and profitability of the company.
1,Software Engineer,True,Pre IPO company so monetary gains if they go public. Rest all is fake. Nobody truly cates about community or company believes.,Nobody is willing to help. You would have to push and ask number of times the senior devs/ engineers to help you if you are stuck. No mentorship to help you grow everybody is working to get personal gains and for IPO event. No attachment to company ethics or goals. All are selfish and dont help you grow but concentrate on personal gains cant trust anyone. Good people who were willing to help and mentor QAs and engineers were nit valued and left the company. Would never recommend anyone to join this startup.
3,"Decent entry level job, definitely has pros and cons.",True,"Great benefits, Nice office, Free snacks.","Lack of communication and sometimes misleading information is provided to employees. When you apply, be aware you will not get all of the holidays they list off. You'll get overtime and holiday pay, but it is misleading to list those days as holidays without noting employees are required to work most of them."
5,Program Manager,True,brilliant people eager to make an impact,"growing very fast, slightly disorganized"

Most rate you low without cause.

App is poor in seeing your driver rating."

3,Room for improvement,True,"Great benefits

Fun environment

Amazing culture

The team is great, very creative and diverse group of folks who each bring their own special talents to the table.","Pay is low, seriously... should be more than 15$/HR for CEA's..

Management is messy. 

Systems need an overhaul, the app needs an overhaul, there needs to be more focus on testing a new update for the app or promotion before rolling it out and causing your Support bucket to overfill beyond unfathomable numbers.

Not much room for growth.

You'll be cross trained but you won't get a raise."
1,Community Associate,True,"Free meals. Lunch is catered, lots of free snacks, booze and coffee. Everyone in the office is happy to work OT and are bought into the culture and company.","CAs are treated like garbage! Everyone else in the office enjoys their job and gets the full experience of working at Lyft. For a technology company, CAs use the worst of what's available, CHROMEBOOKS. I would advise anyone looking to work at Lyft as a CA to just retail instead or get a job as a human punching bag, practically the same thing."
4,Working at Lyft,True,"perks, benefits, smart people, mission and vision",lack of professional development and weak management
4,Go to work with friends!,True,I like the environment a lot. It truly does feel like you are working with your friends. Everyone cares about you as a person and they enjoy hanging out together outside of work.,Little career growth in my field. They keep pushing out a promotion after being here for almost a year and a half.
4,Super Laid Back,True,Everyone is brilliant at what they do.  Work hard play hard atmosphere,The constant celebration of everything can be distracting.  A lot of growing pains.
5,Wonderful Collaborative Environment,True,Fast moving. Empowers you to make decisions that improve the company.,Growing company. Still learning about establishing processes for scale.
5,Change Agent,True,This is the office environment of the future. Can you image working where everyone is happy? It's amazing! It's true. Great benefits and pay.,I wish everyone I know out of work or looking for a positive change could work here.
5,Community Associate,True,i get to share my previous experiences with new drivers. Any time I can pour into people what this great company has taught me it's a plus!,We do our mentoring sessions in the stocking area of a Pep Boys. But we get the job done and most drivers seem pretty happy with the whole process.
3,A Good Job If You Aren't Looking To Be Promoted,True,"Good pay, Good benefits but high deductibles

Swanky offices

Free snacks all day long

Likely a chromebook in your future 

Free t-shirts","No room for being promoted from within, no matter how much they promise you

If you're not meeting your numbers after a few months, you'll get let go with no warning"
5,Best job I've had,True,"-Great at hiring likeminded people

-Management trusts in your decision making skills and empowers the team

-Very little micro management

-Very close knit team

-Solid work-life balance

-You feel like your work has an impact in the company","Personally, there aren't any for me, because I love the job/company; however, I do think some people may see the following as cons:



-very fast paced environment

-processes are improved very quickly - i.e. they change a lot

-flexibility is a must"
5,Best place I have ever worked,True,"The most caring, thoughtful and truly-inspiring company I have ever worked at before.","Honestly, I have nothing negative to say about Lyft. I simply hope I get to stay with the company for a very long time."
2,Company unsuccessful at executing to its potential. Frustrating if you're ambitious.,True,"You work with a team of young, kindhearted people. If you're happy with coasting at your job, you could easily fly under the radar.","This is a company that on the surface presents itself as the nice guy of the industry, but routinely underpays its employees and is wrought with internal politics, causing the company to stagnate.  It cuts the rates of the drivers without a second thought, even though the livelihoods of actual people depend on those numbers they play around with.



If you don't care about how the company performs and are just looking for a FT job, you could find a good home here.  But if you're looking to make your mark on the world, this is not the place to do it."
5,Community Associates,True,"- Incredible company

- You are changing the world (literally) 

- Incredible work atmosphere 

- A lot of benefits 

- Chances of growing are high 

- You are working in a entrepreneurial environment with AMAZING PEOPLE!

- I can't think of one con"
4,Generally okay,True,"Nice benefits. Healthcare and so on. Smart people to work with, and a common enemy in Uber",Day to day problems were pretty easy which led to me getting pretty bored. The infrastructure was also a mess
5,Amazing company with a fantastic vision,True,"– Vision that is meaningful to individuals and communities

– Lots of opportunities to create and shape initiatives

– Fast pace, flexible work environment

– Incredible benefits","– Ambiguous operating structure

– Pace may be disorienting for some"
5,Critical Customer Service Associate,True,"Lyft offers an awesome work environment that's welcoming, constructive, and supportive. This is all made possible by the team!","As a new employee, I have no cons to post at this time. I don't see any arising in the future, either!"
5,The Place To Be!!!,True,"- Positive atmosphere; people are great to work with.

- creative space to innovate and help the company to be even better

- A continuing movement

- Dog friendly

- team oriented environment 

- commute package/Lyft credit to use for rides to work

- Insurance 100% covered for employees and 75% for dependents 

- able to be yourself, have fun, and make money while doing it!","The location in downtown Nashville! The traffic here can be so terrible especially downtown. I would have to say traffic would be a con for any business here in Nashville, TN."
5,Lyft Representative,True,Excellent Customer Service and maintenanc,Need to adjust base pay to match inflation and high gas prices.
4,Low Stress,True,"Flexibility, easy to do, low maintenance",Doesn't pay enough during non-rush hours
3,Great places to work,True,"Nice people, fun work environment",Management was not great had issues with leave policies
3,Glad to be gone,True,"Possible raise promotion every 6 months

Parental leave","lack transparency and accountability. Little opportunity for growths 

DEI throughout is better said that done"
4,Supportive work environment,True,"Supportive management, decent benefits, good team cohesion","Limited tooling, Lyft as a company has grown stagnant and leadership seems transitionary"
4,Good company to work for,True,"unlimited pto, wfh, medical, and 401k plan",they do not match 401k
3,Lots of work for little money,True,"-Lots of Structure in process, organization, great Health Benefits","-Lots of projects with zero recognition and for no money 

-Hard to speak up in such a large company 

-Pandemic really changed Lyft"
1,No perks - awful work environment- Avoid.,True,It sounds like a good job to your family and friends.,Working in a hostile work environment inside an already hostile NTB was really awful. Lyft provided a bad experience to the drivers and the employees were also provided with no structure and bad pay.
3,LYFT,True,consistent salary and the benefits were good.,Low salary and the amount of work required
3,Learn how to rig the system,True,"I only drive bonus times and late nights. Use destination filter to get lots of trips staying in bonus zones. It’s very inconsistent. It’s mercenary so be selective of rides and times, they won’t treat you well just for playing so have to beat them at their own game and refuse to drive off hours",Driver support is awful and they can deactivate you based on invalid passenger complaints from people looking for free rides.
5,Work culture reflects the brand,True,"People are friendly and interested in helping you succeed, not competing with you for accolades

Work culture is relaxed, but still professional

There are organizational structures in place to make everybody's job function more smoothly, but there's still an attitude of 'anything is possible, don't let existing norms constrain you'","Company is definitely the challenger in the marketplace. I view this is an opportunity, not a con, but still something to keep in mind."
4,Great place to work,True,It's a great place to work,"Grew too fast, and too many middle managers"
5,Great place for someone of any age!,True,"Fun environment

Tons of snacks and coffee machines

Dog friendly office

Your co-workers become your friends

Full Benefits paid for by the company

Parking compensation",Sometimes hours can be early or late (But typically never a huge issue).
5,Awesome Team Doing Great Things,True,Great people passionate about what the do.  Fast pace minimal corporate bs.  Good values.  Caring team.  Love the culture and focus on simplicity and delighting customers.  Treating customers and employees better!  Real company mission and vision to change the world.,Can't think of any that matter.  The pace is fast and not for everyone.  Opportunity to connect more teams and communication.  Career development a growing focus which is great for the young org and employees.
1,Proceed with caution,True,"Great benefits, great core values, nice office.","Very little notice given to employees when shift schedules change.  

Lyft core values look great on paper, but are not practiced in Nashville office.  

Leadership run the office like a popularity contest.  If you are an employee in the ""in"" crowd you have it made, but if you are outside the ""in"" crowd, Lyft core values go out the window and you are treated very differently."
5,These people are your BFFs before you even have an offer,True,"- The people are outstanding - really diverse range of people (many ages, good gender balance), all smart, collaborative and unintimidating

- The culture is a very supportive one where everyone helps each other achieve common goals

- People are detached from decisions - you make decisions in teams based on data and gut feelings. If it goes right it's a team success. If it goes wrong, no person is blamed (as far as I've seen)","It's no longer a startup, if that's what you're looking for. It's enormous and there's many moving parts, and sometimes it can seem a bit chaotic. So, only good if you enjoy that level of chaos."
4,Customer Experience,True,"This is a Great environment, excellent pay and benefits. Laid back culture and they really want you to be who you are. That's a great way to allow people feel comfortable.",Too much pressure. Constantly changing how things are done and not enough training. Allow your employees time to adjust between changes.
5,customer experience,True,The people are the best thing about the company. I don't think I saw one person not smiling during the interview process. Everyone acknowledged that they have never had a job like this and loved it. I agree.,There are no cons. This place is great. I see no reason why anyone could not flourish in this environment while having fun at the same time.
3,Customer Service,True,I absolutely love the way Lyft has given me the opportunity  to change the world,I did not know about this opportunity sooner
2,"Great if you're into startups, not structure",True,"Great people, dedicated to what they do, cool concept, great if you crave the startup culture","Lack of structure, still figuring it out, tug of war bw HQ and local offices, pay isn't great for the area,"
5,Account Executive,True,"- Great work environment and culture

- Amazing people that are very smart and driven

- Great interview process with tons of communication and quick feedback

- Dog friendly!

- Good breakfast options in the office and free lunch!

- Tons of opportunity",None that I can think of.
1,Poor/Inconsistet management and unhappy employees,True,"Great perks and benefits- it's a dog friendly office, unlimited snacks in breakroom, free parking, great health insurance. That's about it.","I can only speak for my department since everything is so segregated, but when productivity is low, employees are treated like children and shamed for it. Managers do not communicate clearly with each other and therefore employees receive mixed messages all day long. I understand that a lot of change and adaptability must come with a startup, but the overall energy of the office every day is extreme tension. I"
4,Great Growing Company!,True,"The company culture is AWESOME and everyone seems to be very supportive of one another. 

They really take care of you here and value your opinion. 

Great office with tons of food and snacks in the kitchen plus lunches and dinners. 

Cant wait to see the new office which is suppose to be even bigger!",WFH option would be nice for weekend work on my team.
5,Great company to work at as an engineer,True,"- Great team - good at what they do and fun to be with.  I look forward to seeing my team at work.  Most of the people at lyft are very friendly, willing to help you, and better socially than the stereotypical engineer.



- High technical quality.  There are some very good engineers at lyft who I can learn from



- Fast paced: there aren't many organizational barriers (opposed to a larger company) to shipping code.  You don't need to go through a hierarchy to get an idea across.  At the same time, there are enough infrastructure (definitely could be better but better than nothing) that you can mostly focus on your job (assuming you're not an infrastructure engineer) instead of figuring out your environment (eg: why deploys don't work, problems with data platform..)



- High impact to effort ratio.  There were 4 server engineers on my team (2 at one point) and we shipped a completely new product.



- Good comp (good enough that I never think about this.  I only remembered when I had to rate my compensation down below)","- Development environment can still be improved.



- A few teams need to work quite long hours so work life balance is harder to get right."
3,Assistant,True,benefits are really really good,no possibilities of possible carrier
2,Driving in Reverse,True,"Food, people, culture, Lyft credits","Management is inept. Terrible review and promotion processes. No accountability for terrible decisions. Operational and support plans are trying to solve today's problems with Web 1.0 solutions. Outsource, outsource, outsource."
5,Growing fast,True,The company is growing at an unbelievable speed. This makes everyone excited and I think we're onto something big.,"There is not enough space! 

Due to massive growth not everything is ironed. For example my onboarding process wasn't as smooth."
5,Everything is Awesome,True,"-fast culture

-smaller office, more stuff gets done

-autonomy to make impact

-employees get taken care of

-great mission/office culture","-I must enter at least 5 words, but can't think of any

-it's a startup, normal risks apply"
4,"Amazing work culture, great benefits",True,"Lyft has an amazing company culture that will make you excited to head to work. The people are amazing, and the benefits are great.","Be sure that you ask about your scheduling, as most jobs in (at Nashville HQ) are not your typical M-F, 9-5 positions."
5,Launch Manager,True,"Great environment 

Great people 

Great leadership",There is no cons here!
5,2 Weeks in and all is well.,True,It's got heart. Great people behind the scenes of this company from the bottom up. I have found that this company values the ideas and the people that are involved with the business.,It's still going thru growing pains as there is a lot that we are making up on our own. Which in turn is great because it gives us the flexibility and freedom to try different things to see what works.
5,Working At Lyft,True,"* Uses lots of off-the-shelf software, only builds new things as necessary

* Modern architecture

* Good leadership in engineering and elsewhere

* Fun culture","* Still figuring out multi-office dynamics

* Not enough people to get everything that needs doing done"
4,"A lot to learn, but not enough guidance",True,"Great team environment, great people.","Not a lot of guidance, no transparency, lack of communication"
1,Unable to Maintain Quality with Fast Growing Rate of Company,True,"- Has great perks: $175 lyft credit, commuter benefits, free snacks and lunch, personal macbook, full access to Udemy courses, One Medical Membership, discounts on select items","- You have to deal with lots of office politics

- No transparency

- There is a lack of communication between different teams

- Salary is not competitive for roles throughout the company

- No opportunity for promotion or growth

- Certain teams are looked down upon. There is definitely a hierarchy - and people make it known openly

- On my direct team, it's a consensus that upper management is trying to make us quit - versus paying us severance. Several months previous, the majority of my direct team was laid off and outsourced."
5,The best choice I ever made!,True,"- amazing, helpful and genuine coworkers (I actually like hanging out with them outside of a work context)

- a mission I believe in- getting cars off the road, community

- cool projects and collaborators

- amazing compensation/benefits- free lunch/dinner/snacks, Lyft credits, awesome office, cute dogs everywhere

-pre-IPO","The company is fairly young as a whole, but it's still easy to identify good role models. You just have to look around a bit."
5,Excited,True,"I'm an onboarding engineer at Lyft. People here are very honest, friendly, and enthusiastic about their jobs, that's one of the biggest reason why I joined Lyft. Communication was fast as people repond quickly to emails. Can't complain on compensation and employee perks :)","San Francisco HQ seemed to have reached its capacity, looking forward to moving to a bigger space."
5,Early Impressions,True,"The logistic and operational problems that the company faces are really interesting, and there seems to be a lot of room for creativity in how one tries to address them. Moreover, the current employees are really nice!",I have none so far!
4,Making Waves,True,Great culture and vision - great leadership and execution,Have to take a long term view - its a long a hard battle
5,"Great place to grow yourself, and amazing data",True,"Lyft is all about the culture. We're working in one of the biggest emerging industries of the decade, and our business outlook is very strong. But there is still a genuineness that filters down from the founders to all the teams that I've worked with, and the people I'm working seem to be the happiest that I've seen in any of my previous companies. 



I've received strong mentorship, and at the same time been able to immediately (within my first month of employment) start my own projects, driving them to completion over my first few months. My team respects the strengths that people bring in with them, and I've felt they foster autonomy. External stakeholder recognition comes easy, and causes me to want to go above and beyond the call of duty (e.g. occasionally working on weekends) because I know I'm being recognized for it.



This is the first company where I've felt an allegiance to the company values and, although it sound corny, actually feel proud to follow them. (e.g. 'Be Yourself' - this actually feels like the first place I've worked that doesn't focus on conformity and this feels liberating).","The Data Analytics team at Lyft is very autonomous, but this can lead to the sense that we're are not being put under external pressure to grow and improve. A lot of this motivation has to come from inside you. I'd only recommend working here if you feel personally motivated to perform, and to contribute to the future of human centric transportation. 



The ride-sharing industry may look like a battle front, but Lyft feels like it's rejected this metaphor. I'm aware that I'm probably responsible at Lyft for the equivalent work of 4-5 people at Uber, who are probably each working 40-50% more hours than me. This feel rewarding (impact wise) but I almost crave higher expectations and standards.



The HR department feels like a black box and I'm disappointed by their tools and documentation. Coworker feedback should be completely separated from 360 performance and compensation reviews as there are huge incentive misalignments (if I give my coworker valuable suggestions for improvement, this feels like it could hinder them from getting rewarded appropriately.) This could just be because we're growing so fast and this system is new."
3,Customer Experience Associate,True,"fun culture, tons of perks","tech bro culture, cross-departmental communication non existant"
3,Real Flexibility,True,"Team Work , Flexibility , Agility, Flat mangement","Dogs , nothing else really!!!!!"
4,Focus on product and customer experience,True,"I left my previous job working in Corporate Strategy for a growing software company to join Lyft as a Data Analyst 5 months ago.  I was looking for an opportunity to drive growth in a company where product and customer experience came first, and while I had experience working in finance and executing executive-facing projects, I came in with little-to-no SQL and formal analytics experience.



Ramp-up time was a brutal exercise of multitasking and juggling requests from stakeholders, but it pushed my performance and execution to the next level, and I was (and am) empowered every step of the way to use my own judgement, time management and prioritization.



Pros include:



- fast paced work environment with a bias for action and learning by doing

- opportunity for executive exposure and recognition

- driving real business impact

- personal empowerment and a work environment with little oversight (if that's your thing)

- San Francisco HQ

- perks--Lyft credit, food, happy hours, unlimited PTO","- Hyper headcount growth means that departments are quickly become siloed and quality mentorship is hard to come by

- Dealing with multiple stakeholders is a constant exercise is managing expectations

- Unclear what the future career development path will look and feel ($$$) like--challenge with any startup"
3,"Excited going in, disappointed going out",True,"- dog friendly office

- catered lunch and dinner 

- all the snacks you could want 

- dedicated and intelligent co-worker's 

- easily accessible executives

- large opportunity for mentorship","- many management decisions are poorly thought through (ex. The move to Nashville for some teams on operations weakened the support team as members who were not chosen to stay moved on to other opportunities, leaving the remaining members to pick up the slack during a busy holiday time with an increased volume of work) 

- communication across teams is very weak

- upper level management can be ""out of touch"" with mid to lower level employees

- little transparency from upper level management"
5,Cool company with Impactful Projects,True,Really interesting work with a really smart team. You will be given a lot of responsibility from the day you join and opportunities to be very impactful,"sometimes things are a little chaotic due to the nature of it being a high intensity work environment. There isn't that much direction a lot of time, but different people will thrive or fail in that environment"
5,Data Scientist,True,"As a data scientist at Lyft, I get to own an important algorithm.

My work directly affects the company's success, in an objective and measurable way.

The company's culture encourages ownership and innovation. it's about bottom-line results, and how I achieve them is entirely up to me.



Lyft is a great workplace if you want to own an important piece of the product and take responsibility for its success.",The office is in San Francisco.
5,Great place with excellent values,True,"- community oriented

- great culture

- excellent colleagues, especially in engineering

- lots of interesting projects

- lots of interesting ideas being explored

- the CEO and President are like best buddies forever

- the CTO and VP Engineering are both outstanding

- there is a reasonable amount of fun activities (sometimes too many)","Almost always, the A-players at Lyft are those who deeply understand our mission and exemplify our values. They naturally do great work.  Others (a minority) need to be helped, sometimes this is difficult."
3,"Cool culture, Lack of transparency and growth",True,"* Company culture is absolutely amazing. Really bright and focused individuals work here and the office is absolutely stunning.

* The catered meals, fully stocked kitchen, cold brew tap and consistent happy hours keep employees really happy.

* ""Free"" rides are cool, but it ended up getting taken out of paychecks so maybe not so cool.

* The people were what made the job worthwhile.","* Pay was not sufficient in order to happily live in the Bay Area. Definitely below industry standard.

* Lack of actual transparency. Lots of news kept in the upper division of the company and not dispersed to all.

* Disconnect between support and upper management."
4,Feels like a lot can be improved but huge opportunity for growth ahead. My question is - will it happen quick enough?,True,"Small teams, chill culture, beautiful women, good food, amazing data gurus, waking up everyday knowing you're helping solve the ""traffic problem"" is really inspirational",Very little equity. Not enough communication from CEO. Needs more meetings with high level management as the teams feel lost in terms of direction and day to day grudegework
3,Support Associate,True,"Tasty snacks, mostly fun and vibrant people among middle and lower roles","Incompetent management, lack of internal communication between teams, reckless promotions"
2,Lost what made it special,True,"Free lunch, smart and dedicated co-workers at the lower and middle levels, dog-friendly office, monthly Lyft credit (though heavily taxed), health Insurance, beer &amp; wine at team meeting every other week, all the swag you could want.","Low pay compared to other SF companies. No one held accountable for mistakes. Performance reviews are frustrating, slow, and don't reflect time period they supposedly cover. Good luck getting equity. Actionable feedback is difficult to get. No communication across the company; teams just do stuff and don't inform other teams it will affect. No strong leadership. Arbitrary cost-cutting that doesn't seem to make sense."
5,Brand + Culture = Uplifting,True,"Huge upside startup with crazy growth (Make it Happen - Core Value)

More ownership, smaller teams, creating processes (Create Fearlessly - Core Value)

Fun loving Culture, Relaxed work environment, employees treated well (Be Yourself - Core Value)

Industry leading perks and benefits; unlimited PTO, Lyft Credits, Clipper Monthly Credits (Uplift Others - Core Value)

Great world class Engineering team; top level Software Engineers","No shuttle for South Bay (but we get Clipper and Lyft Credit monthly)

Growing out of HQ (too many high fives on the way in - new office in future)"
5,Design Contract,True,All of the employees were incredibly kind and amicable. They catered lunch everyday and had really great snack options. The facility was very nice also.,The employees seem overworked. It also seemed like the business was winding down in some ways. I don't think they were able to hire the folks that they needed to.
5,Best two years of my life,True,"- Amazing culture

- Friendliest employees

- Dog friendly office!!!!

- Opportunity for upward mobility

- Lots of exposure to senior level leadership

- Amazing perks and benefits

- The company really does invest in their employees and makes sure they have all the necessary tools and mentorship needed to succeed","- Amount of Lyft credit given every month could be more

- Not enough parking spaces in employee parking lot"
3,LYFT CAMPUS AMBASSADOR,True,It was really cool to be able to take control of recruiting members to join LYFT on campus. I was able to make a lot of money by having my own sign up code,Receiving your payment was such a pain. You have to trust your LYFT MANAGER to give it to you. You also have to trust him/her to keep track of who gets paid. I feel like I was cheaper out of some funds.
4,"Fun atmosphere, terrible pay",True,"Lyft strives hard to create a fun, inclusive, and community driven atmosphere. Catered lunch. Fun events.","No equity for non-executive employees. Low pay. Terrible internal communication. Product focused, not customer focused."
3,Operations Associate,True,Great people to work with and a lot to learn. Moving around within the company is fairly easy. Lots of gimmicky perks like lunch every day and an open kitchen stocked with snacks and drinks and even kombucha and cold brew coffee.,"Horrible support from HR. Salaries are consistently 20-30% under the industry average and they are unwilling to reconsider. Promotions are based on a timeline, not on merit or accomplishments.  There are no end of year bonuses. There is no 401k matching plan; they are ""too small of a company to offer that"". Overall, a great place to get experience for your career, but not a lasting place to continue your career."
5,Fantastic so far...,True,"Great culture, fast moving, high levels of ownership","Crowded office, redundant teams that have very similar roles across orgs"
4,Could do better,True,"- Free lunch/food

- Commuter benefits (although you could pay $250 for a monthly parking spot) 

- Young/friendly office culture","- Not enough experienced direct managers 

- Scrambling to solve issues --- very reactionary vs. proactive 

- Embarrassingly low pay 

- Not many opportunities to move up"
5,great place to work,True,"great atmosphere and perks, creative environment","low pay, not a ton of opportunities for career advancement"
2,Changing how we get around,True,Passion for changing the way people get around cities and disrupting an old industry.,Not enough focus. Too many cooks in the kitchen.
5,Lyft Recruiting,True,"Company is transparent, execs are easy to talk to and accessible, innovation and new ideas are welcome.","Fast moving companies require everyone to work hard. You will be expected to participate so if you're looking for less involved role, this may not be for you."
5,Great So Far,True,"Lyft has cultivated a company culture that seems to fit with its brand promise - friendly, inclusive, and quirky enough to remind you there's a soul behind the slick operations.","The rapid growth will test Lyft's ability to feel like a family. That rapid growth also stretches HR capacity, so recruiting can be a slow process."
5,Excellent culture!,True,"A very collaborative environment, yet you'll get to speak up as an individual. All teams are very supportive and respectful to each other, everyone cares about the company and no egos around here. Perks and benefits are awesome, playful environment, location is great.","Team structure and creative process has rooms to improve, but that's not really cons, it's just growing and it is being improved."
4,The teenage phase is rough,True,"Incredibly smart and kind folks. Free food, if you're into that kind of thing. Definitely a fun product and hard problems to solve.","Still young minded, but no longer a young company. They need to get out of the teenage phase asap and start acting like a bit company. With that said, their culture couldn't sustain a fast move in to that, so it's a fine line. One that I hope they breach. Depending on your role, work/life balance isn't a thing, but it can be if you view it as just a job."
4,New to the company in engineering but its exciting,True,It is a great atmosphere and a fantastic attitude.  Everything here has the feel of a company that takes care of its people and wants people to enjoy it.  The amenities are real and vibe is great.  It is a company that preaches what it means and means what it preaches.,I have had a hard time adjusting to meeting people and breaking into the company socially.  Since some of the teams are so silo'ed vertically it seems that its hard to interact with people around the company.  Its also growing so fast that I feel like people might be slipping through the cracks.
5,Lyft is all about community and collaboration,True,"The people who work at Lyft really embody the company's values. Everyone, including executive management, is extremely approachable and down-to-earth. The company culture has a great vibe - positive, collaborative, and uplifting / supportive. Makes me happy and excited to come to work each day!",The company is rapidly expanding so it's tough to keep up with all the people joining and how teams are quickly changing.
5,Newly hired iOS developer,True,Great projects that people are extremely motivated about. Really friendly and social atmosphere. Smart people. Great work/life balance. Opportunities for impact and influence. Use of Swift highly encouraged. Fast release cycles.,"Derth of open-source opportunities on iOS, though there are iOS developers here who are big contributors in their free time and pushing for more work-related opportunities."
3,Support Associate,True,"• Catered lunches every weekday and fully stocked kitchens

• Spacious building

• Really good benefits","• Embarrassingly low pay for non-salaried employees

• A severely unfortunate focus on quantity over quality

• Support being outsourced to third party companies in Asia to lower costs

• With the new board of executives, comes stringent cost-cutting

• No 401k matching"
4,Operations Manager,True,Great company culture where co-workers tend to be more like friends than work associates. Young people come together to create something bigger than offering a ride to a stranger.,"Because co-workers tend to be more like friends, if you aren't the super social type, you're frowned upon. It's almost as if the expectation is to hang out with everybody, everyday after work. And if you've got a family, forget about it! They don't get it.



Oh, and pay for the vast amount of work could be better."
5,Great Company!,True,Great work environment and vision for ride sharing business,No cons to report as of this writing
5,Fun and smart co-workers in a company driving innovation,True,"Unlimited PTO, free lunch, great culture of fun &amp; nice yet hard working employees, good perks, room for career advancement, dog friendly.",HQ not on direct public transit line; must be able to pivot and problem solve in a fast paced environment
5,Fast-paced and exciting place to work,True,"-transparency into the company and all business decisions

-high impact

-interesting technical problems that are tangible in the real world

-great culture","-not enough process around certain things

-not good if you don't like dogs"
4,Fun place to work.,True,good coffee. like the cereal selection.,Don't like the hipsters around this place.
5,It's all about the people,True,"Lyft has managed to create an immense sense of family. Everyone who works here is driven by a similar mission, and it becomes infectious. It makes it easy to look forward to work every morning when you get to hang out with such wonderful people.","As we've grown so rapidly, there are certain times when communication between teams breaks down, causing occasional inefficiencies."
5,Best career experience yet,True,"- Amazing manager who takes good care of me and my career goals

- A great team who works really well together 

- Positive and collaborative company culture",Nothing truly noteworthy at the moment.
2,Ops Department,True,"Free food, great people, fun place to work.",Novice management and reckless promotions.
5,The best place I've ever worked,True,"Everyone here loves what they do, and the passion is contagious. As a software engineer, you get to work on some really interesting behind the scenes projects that are core to scaling the business.","It's a start-up, so things can be chaotic at times, but I personally enjoy the start-up environment. If you're looking for a clear structure and management of the type you'd find at a big company, this is not the place for you."
5,Lyft is great!,True,"Flexibility

Investment in employees

Excellent money

Virtual company","Virtual company

Limited communication outlets

Some glitches in app

GPS accuracy"
5,Awesome company to work for. Amazing people and smart management,True,"-Great product and brand.

-Upper management really cares and listen to both employees and the community

-Good pay (for my role at least)

-Free lunch, monthly commuter benefits

-Free Lyft credits occasionally

-Positive and encouraging work environment

-barely any micro management.



*************

I just want to clarify a few things with regards to the driver complaints below:



-It is very difficult to get a low rating with our system. A 1 star or 3 star rating doesn't bring down the overall average as much as one would think. You would have to be earning low ratings consistently and over a long period of time (months) for the system to really start lowering your overall star ratings.



-We have a very big community of drivers and passengers, sometimes it can take a little longer for support to reach out. But by no means are we singling any body out. Support folks work the hardest and often after hours, so it's understandable. Patience is a virtue my friend.



-Unfortunately, sometimes the passenger experience can be unpleasant. That's why we allow you, the driver to rate the passenger after each ride. If you give him/her a low rating, that person won't be matched up with you again. 



-With regards to navigation, drivers should always ask the passenger if there's a route they prefer. But navigation could also mean your driving style. Safety will always be the #1 priority for our passengers and drivers.

Disclaimer: This review is voluntarily written.","Not really any, just typical growing startup problems. Some politics, but which company doesn't have politics?"
5,"Amazing people, doing amazing things.",True,"-awesome culture

-free lunch everyday

-transparency b/w upper management and employees

-creating a product that is engaging the community

-the energy is always so positive every day

-this service is bringing social media + real people together. Bringing back the human aspect","-big workload and fast pace. I see this as a good thing, and it is not unique to Lyft. You'll see this at any successful startup

-compensation is on the lower side. But in my opinion, the benefits of working with these people outweighs the salary

-can't really think of anything more! love these guys"
5,"“Amazing team, incredible product. Proud and humbled to work here.”",True,"Team camaraderie, energy, and creativity focused on solving an amazing problem.","Non really, just your normal startup growing pains."
5,"Great, fun company!",True,"Fun office, flexible scheduling, nice coworkers. The office is really nice with cool art on the walls, a stocked kitchen, and plenty of dogs around all the time. They also compensate for travel on caltrain/muni.","Not the highest pay, especially for living in San Francisco which is so expensive."
3,Underpaid,True,Freedom and flexibility in work schedule. Be your own boss.,Underpaid. Long hours. Inconsistent. Less than 50% of fare goes to driver.
5,Good,True,Good good good good good,Not that bad in my opinion
4,Lyft hub,True,Working for Lyft I feel lots of freedom and support.

1,Lyft Driver Support is concerning.,True,"Flexible hours, so you can work whenever you need be","- Lyft driver support is extremely disappointing. My phone froze and I had to cancel the ride after completing the trip and dropping the customer off to their location. Lyft refused to pay me by excusing it as ""we stop tracking rides after they're cancelled"" - to which I asked why not because they had the data showing I finished the trip (because I cancelled AFTER the trip completed) and the consumer's contact to confirm I dropped them off. To this, they didn't have a response, so I asked them if I could get a phone number to talk to a representative - to which, they just ended the conversation on Lyft support. Just know that if you have technical difficulties, they don't care. I've been with Lyft for a couple years and this was the last straw. Uber has better support for their drivers."

Lyft embraces a culture of continuous change and growth. This is clear in both the technology and people that feeds the company day to day.

Everybody is open to discussions to understand, commit and take action.

As a security professional, you are exposed to state of the art technology and threats.","It can be hard to catch up with the continuous changes.

Attrition is high, due to the higly competitive environment and the companies Lyft is compared with.

If not used to full ownership, it's impossible to be a key player in the company.

Security team is small compared to the size of the company."

2,Company culture completely failed during the pandemic,True,"Lyft generally hires the best and brightest. Most people who work for Lyft are genuinely kind and generous, and wonderful to work with. The company takes strong political positions and supports excellent causes.","The company made very little effort to transition well into a remote environment. As a result, ELT stopped understanding how to check on the health &amp; wellness of staff during such a terrible couple of years. Instead of focusing on retention, upper management constantly hassled anyone who took ""unreasonable"" vacation (note that vacation is ""unlimited"") and got angry at anyone not performing at 100% all the time (no consideration for anyone suffering from COVID/COVID effects for example, or those having to deal with childcare issues, etc.). It also quickly became clear that there was a cultural division between those who had worked together in the office and those on-boarded remote, with insufficient effort made to give remote workers the same kinds of face-to-face interactions that longer-term employees did not need, as they had already built internal connections. Add obvious hypocrisy with how drivers are treated (serious moral injury), plus throw in some absolutely ridiculous attrition rates, and this job became unreasonably difficult and untenable."

Some teams are terrible to work with.. managers and most of upper level management don’t align with Lyfts core values.. they like to hire people just like them so it becomes a dictatorship.

- Inclusive. This place is extremely welcoming to all that do not identify as straight, white, cis gendered men, but you’re all included as well. 

- Leadership that genuinely cares about your well-being- with a few exceptions in each department that should have been removed a while ago. 

- Pay, in my opinion, is good for roles with a Specialist title or higher (for Safety Dept this will be Senior Specialist or higher).","- Really caring leadership but they will misguide you and leave you believing you’ve earned a promotion that you will then have to fight 40 other people for and trust me, you will lose. This is a group of very capable people and pleading your case is tough. 

- Interviews. I cannot stress this enough; too many interviews for every single role. Consider that you’re interested in a total of 5 promotions with 1 year. You will endure 7 interviews for each. 35 interviews within a company you’re already working for."

Good pay

People are nice",Moves too too slow - lots of back and forth
5,Contracting with Lyft has been the perfect job for me,True,I’m in charge of my work schedule. I meet and have discussions with passengers. I choose the number of hours and corresponding income I want. I am continually evaluated in real time for job performance and given the opportunity to change my actions which conflict with job description and expected norms. Lyft provides multiple payment methods ranging from immediate pay to weekly pay and do this through direct deposit or adding income to credit card.,"The Lyft app gps is not consistently accurate and provides conflicting directions occasionally. There is no person to person contact with Lyft, all interaction takes place through the app."

4,"Great comp, yet high turnover",True,Highly competitive salary + equity package.,Leadership and management constantly changing.
1,Bullying culture in Core Tech,True,"I used to really like the pizza oven, and free food; but all that has changed since COVID","This is a hard one:

(1) the job they sell you in the interview probably isn’t the job you will be doing. This is a common a known problem. In the EA role it you will be called a business partner—realistically the leaders will leverage you as a scheduler and there is no room to grow. 

(2) if you are a URM you have a high likelihood to be bullied with very little help. Lyft isn’t transparent about the diversity—the numbers you find in the Lyft diversity report are far from reality. HR will not talk about/share diversity metrics probably Bc the numbers are botched—the company rarely fixes their mistakes they rely heavily on their forced arbitration clause—if you do join, you can opt out of this.

(3) culture is very toxic"

very fast pace, sometimes too fast(con).

nice perks and social events","seems to be haphazard at times - things change quickly.

high turnover - despite paying top dollar, people keep leaving."
5,"Amazing benefits, great company with amazing values.",True,"Great benefits, amazing core values, fast paced challenging environment.",The work can take a toll on mental health and you must be able to work odd hours and weekends.
2,your standard startup turned giant tech company culture,True,"• bagel Wednesdays

• small engineering teams made it generally easy to do good work

• they made efforts to have All Hands be relevant to most people

• lunches were pretty good","• didn't compensate their early employees well

• later employees with less experience and less knowledge about the company were given many times more in compensation due to the competitive employee market"

3,Ok for short-term,True,"Work when YOU want, majority of app is hassle-free, available same day payouts for small surcharge.","Lyft takes too large portion of fare, inconsistent driver promotions (bonuses/streaks), app navigation is horrible at giving efficient routes at times or a bit off in timing when rendering vocal directions."

2,Mmmmmm,True,It is a job and nothing more than a job.,The job is boring and unexciting.

Smart people",CEO once said that there aren’t enough people staying for dinner
1,Encourage Toxic Environment,True,I learned so many invaluable skills regarding how to type emails and handle stressful situations. I also learned about how social media works.,"My job entitled more than the online description when I applied. 

Management never includes associates so you end up being the last to know about major changes.

My manager was racist and Lyft never did anything to reprimand them or hold them accountable. I found out they didn’t want me on the team from the start and would talk about me to other employees and accuse me of things without any cause. They never encouraged my growth as an associate and always found ways to tell me I wasn’t doing enough. Even pulling bad numbers saying I took too much sick time when I only took 15 hours the entire 1.5 years I was there.

I also only got one raise the entire time I was there and it was a few cents."
2,Yikes,True,"Unlimited paid time off, good benefits","low accountability, sink or swim, limited visibility, messy"
5,The pros and cons of Uber/Lyft.,True,"Your working the second you walk out your door.

No flexibility with schedules at all compared to other ""cooperate"" jobs"
5,Great place to work (even through the growing pains),True,Tough year for Lyft but have maintained aspects of the corp culture that has made is successful,Still recovering from impact of Covid and as such have sustained some leadership losses

Breaks don't have to be scheduled

No dealing with employee drama

Great conversations

Meet all kinds of people

Pretty much your own boss","Pick up sketchy people from time to time.

- Caring colleagues on a personal level

- Credit for contributions made is taken by those who didn't do or contribute to the work.

- The HR and Employee Relations orgs are openly biased towards preserving leadership interests and headcount over the supporting individual contributor reports of issues, harassment, or inequitable treatment.

- Performance and promotions are evaluated based on how happy you make your assigned stakeholders—not on actual job performance or contributing to the mission of the company.

- Does not truly support a remote workforce model—openly biased towards working in an office over-investing in the technology and systems to enable distributed workforce success."

There are certain people in VERY influential roles that don't have a care for the people the work with, or the people they serve (who they honestly don't even see as real people). Nepotism at the top, toxic culture, anyone who tried to stand up for what's right is silenced, reorg'd, shown the door. The last straw is pulling benefits from those of us who were laid off due to Covid and are on Cobra (was supposed to be on full benefits until November) with one week notice. (No joke.)

I had the opportunity to work on many teams and roles over my tenure.","Long hours and complete availability was expected. There was constant arguing and raised voices in meetings. These meetings were three times a week, involved over 15 senior team members, and were generally a waste of time and exhibitions of talking over the one two women in the room.



Transparency from executive leadership seems to disappear as the years went by. Regularly in all-hands meetings, questions the team didn't like were skipped in the queue despite many upvotes.



Lastly, the company was founded on the idea of community and taking care of each other. Fast forward nine years and they are doing everything they can to avoid supporting the people generating the wealth of the executives. To go one step further, spending millions of dollars on a campaign leading consumers along about preventing fare increases only to raise prices afterwards without having to pay the benefits. Could you be any greedier?"

Additionally, the leadership was painful. It was constantly changing and lacked transparency. Leaders would shift from vertical to vertical, constantly. They didn't have employees best interest in mind, and the culture was evidently bad. They were always looking out for the worst, not looking to develop and enhance their employees.

- it’s hard to enjoy what you do when a large majority of the company bashes on your role about how pointless it is, how the entire department should go away, and how much of a money guzzler it is. CAs are the least paying lyft role. Experienced Lyft drivers make more than CAs."

Compensation/benefits","Senior Leadership (Nashville)

Inexperienced workforce who arent open to change

Cliques

No real Career development for lower level positions

Diversity: Nashville office culture mismatch with SF (diversity)Top positions in Nashville look like the South, moving to Nashville may have been a great cost savings but it comes with issues. Now living in the South, I was optimistic about the changes Lyft could bring but when you hire from that same pool, you see it happening. We arent winning...they are. Maybe we should have picked a better Southern state that is tech savvy and more diverse like Georgia (ATL), Texas (Houston/ Austin/Dallas), NC (RDU or Charlotte).... All of these are also college heavy and could get us the savings we need. Not to mention Nashville is expensive for what you get and we have a bunch of inexperienced people doing critical work."
1,...,True,"Cool Employees, Young &amp; Hip","No Raise , Busy Work, No Promotion"
3,Terrible Corporate Culture,True,You get to meet some lovely drivers and they very obviously look for a certain kind of candidate when hiring so you'll probably get along pretty well with your coworkers.,"You'll be forced to work overtime and then have your time card adjusted without your knowledge or consent because ""we don't pay overtime here"", HQ absolutely refuses to provide more headcount so you're forever understaffed, they've gone through two rounds of layoffs after promising there would be no layoffs, they are actively encouraging travel through a pandemic and refuse to listen to their ""essential"" employees forced to deal with the backlash first hand while they're sitting in their houses working from home. All while refusing to pay a livable salary to their field employees."

- Company takes diversity seriously (though other reviewers disagree).

- Offices and food were nice.

- Senior management was engaged.","-Legal department is cliquey internally, and also isolated from the rest of the company. Advancement is unclear, and teams are middle-heavy.

-Little to no process, RACI basically ad hoc. Given the risks built into product/business model, without clear RACI (or at least without clear adoption thereof) too much devolves into CYA.

- That CYA is tedious and critical, as other teams will scapegoat when their projects aren't going smoothly.

- The deadline is always yesterday, the new initiative you're being asked to consult on will start on ""oh we actually kind of already started,"" and is being lead by someone probably."

Role also became much more customer-facing which resulted in little to no time to contribute to larger, more meaningful operations projects. Company policies often made at higher level had detrimental effects on drivers and CAs were forced to face and clean up these negative interactions which became draining and emotionally challenging at times."

1,DO NOT DRIVE FOR UBER AND LYFT,True,"Quick money,you can work whenever you want","You can't make a living wage,no tips,passengers will destroy your car's interior and put a number on your mile gage.

It seemed like it was hard to get everyone to speak one universal language to carry a cohesive mission, especially with so many business lines at one point (contract drivers, rentals, bikes and scooters, driver centers). A lot of people took on more work than they should and a lot of people skated by without others noticing. It was difficult to work without alignment and not knowing which vertical your team falls on or even just who to report to sometimes."

Very organized tools to get the job done.",Management is all over the place and hardly can relay information in time of it being used. Pay is kinda an insult considering the job is a bit repetitive (super easy to be burnt out)

2,"Great core values, poor execution and toxic work environment",True,"I worked for Lyft for just under 5 years on the Global Operations team and then moved to the Market Operations team. Some of the pros are getting to work with truly dedicated and talented people who love their job and love the communities we served. My coworkers helped each other, had brilliant ideas, and worked tirelessly to execute our projects regardless of level. 



The biggest pro is the local teams.","Communication from HQ is not great. Often new programs would launch in our market and we'd have no idea until the public release. It was not always clear how our work locally was supporting HQ initiatives. There was a large disconnect between what was happening in San Fran and what was happening in dispersed markets. 



Lyft also struggles to retain and promote good talent. Despite their ""commitment to diversity"", as a diverse person I was often belittled, undervalued, and overlooked. I watched countless less equipped and less qualified external hires receive leadership positions over more qualified, diverse internal candidates. Despite years of ""exceeds expectations"" reviews, extensive previous management experience, and several advanced degrees, I received one promotion in 4 years at Lyft. I repeatedly asked what I could do to move into a more senior role and had no complaints about my work, only ""the time just isn't right yet"".



I left because there is no room for advancement there for someone like me. Their stated values are mostly lip service and, despite repeated feedback, leadership is not open to hearing from more diverse voices. If you are not white and male, I'd stay away from Lyft."

4,Not sure where the company is going,True,Fast pace and ever changing,Certain Manages in high positions
1,"Low wage, toxic management, hazardous work environment",True,You cannot be fired for poor performance.,"You will not receive raises for great performance. The constantly boast that they promote from within and that they fight for higher wages, but all new openings are filled by affirmative action hires with zero experience/ethics. Constant safety hazards and sexual misconduct, management is too complacent to answer your emails suggesting solutions. I was the company's top performing mechanic, and recently left because you can't live in san diego on $2200 per month. The atmosphere is tense and management has no problem lying no matter the question. Would not recommend."

2,A good springboard into something far better,True,"- Good location in the city

- Young company with a mix of experience levels

- Most coworkers were inspired by the mission","- Constantly playing catchup to Uber, sometimes scrapping good ideas of our own to respond to Uber's product innovation

I preferred to quit because of covid19.

Too many people don't protect themselves, I don't want to take the risk.



it was above all the Covid19 that made me arrested."

5,Great community that pushes you,True,"- most of the people I encounter are collaborative and encouraging

- the work I do is fulfilling

- every team has an impact

- everyone has a voice","- upward movement can be challenging

- due to covid, benefits are lacking"
5,"Very supportive environment, great culture",True,"Lyft is remarkably non-corporate for a company of its size. I almost never had to put up with BS as a data scientist, I was always able to make my case and be heard clearly. Everyone was really collaborative, and when I had to go on medical leave, the amount of support I had from my team was astounding.

Also, the management structure for DS roles (report to a manager on the Science team but be embedded on the particular engineering team) worked really well for me- having a manager who knew my methods, and a team that was working with me to apply them, is very sensible.","Obviously they're under a great amount of stress while COVID-19 is decimating their revenue, and I don't know whether anything has changed since April."

Great Benefits / Salary

Great Company",Work Life Balance Is Challenging
5,Great place to work,True,"Caring, agile, has a strong vision.","High pressure environment, not for everyone."
1,Be ready to be taken advantaged of,True,"There are none, all of the benefits were taken away post IPO. PTO policy for hourly employees is a joke. There are no retention tools in place that reward team members for their hard work.",This company made up some nonsense claiming Community associates are considered to be “essential” employees. CAs are being put at risk of being exposed to COVID and the company continues to sweep it under the rug. They do not have any guidelines such as containment or testing procedures in the event team members are exposed. There are drivers who knowingly had COVID &amp; have shown up at field locations putting team members in danger of contracting COVID. Yet management insist on keeping these locations open because they are considered to be “essential”. If that’s the case CAs should be receiving hazard pay.
5,Great job and company culture,True,Autonomy is given to leaders to do their job,Really can’t think of any cons

1,Horrible,True,"Some nice coworkers, free therapy which was much needed living through this job, $200 free Lyft credits every month which seem to have been disbanded since I left,","EXTREMELY low pay for the type of work and amount of it, brutal job tasks, basically getting yelled at all day by drivers, felt unsafe at times when drivers would come in mad, we had to go through safety and de-escalation trainings where we learned how to escape if there was an active shooter at our hub. sounds dramatic but I feel like I have mild PTSD from the job. Traumatic, lots of emotionally charged driver questions regarding their livelihood, management was young and unexperienced, lack of proper training or direction for hard questions we were asked, no HR staff on site - huge red flag!!, no career opportunities and very competitive for the few jobs that opened up, constantly understaffed which made me have a lot more work that I regularly would have had, lots of overtime."
4,Great jon,True,Very nice team with great opporutunities,There aren't any cons in my opinion
4,Amazing,True,Ability to ask answer questions,None at the moment for company
1,Cheating with bonus payments .,True,"look carefully often do not pay the promised bonuses.  And they require proof of the submitted bonus offers.  screenshot of the proposed bonus.  And if the Driver has not made a screenshot of the bonus, then the driver is not paid the bonus payment.",Often cheating with bonuses . Level customer service is low .
4,Fast moving company with lack of vision.,True,Very competitive. Lyft hires the best of the best in the tech industry. They also pay top dollar. The products launching are fun and exciting to work on. Most teams are collaborative and want to partner for successful growth.,Extremely political. There is not enough scope and power to go around for all the top talent they hire so power becomes land grab situation. Impact driven culture which means politics is at an all time high and people will easily throw other team members under the bus.
3,It's good in a pinch,True,"Make your own hours

Bonuses to help with car rental costs

Quick email responses to inquiries","The car rentals are really expensive and the bonuses don't cover the cost

I made over 57k last year, only took home 18k, still had to pay 2k in taxes."

4,Nice thing they got going for em but still a start-up,True,long enough hours for a weekend shift.,"disorganized, management was kinda rude"
3,QE Dept is directionless,True,There are some amazing people that work at Lyft as well as great benefits.,"QE department not taken seriously, automation engineers spend most of their time doing manual testing, managers all have their own agenda and don't really agree on anything."
4,.,True,"Great benefits, Great work/life balance, Great mission","Too much change, Poor Leadership"
5,Good job and compensation,True,"Interesting projects and great coworkers, good compensation",Instability of an unprofitable company during challenging economic times
5,Great Place to Start,True,"Great community, strong sense of self, a place to grow if you put in the work","If you want to leave, sometimes the management and HR will seem as if they don't care as much or really want to fight for you to stay"
3,A Job that's on my time,True,"all kinds of people,I made my own hours,Being my own boss,Doing what i love....driving,being able to listen to music all day","Being stuck in traffic,Peoples criticism,if its ones only source of income..it can be taken away in a heartbeat if someone didn't have a good experience and embelishes the negative parts of their trip to where you get put on probation and lyft does not even investigate the drivers side of an issue.Long trips that don't pay out,having to split your fares three ways and still have gas money,riders refusing to exit my vehicle when the trip was over,unwanted male advances or attention,drunk people,impatient riders when you may just be getting adapted to a new area and a passenger cancels on you"
4,Decent Company,True,Good benefits with decent pay scale,"Markets outside of California, Illinois, and New York are often ignored."
3,"Good company, terrible marketing department",True,Good culture and values. Some of the best people I've worked with. Lots of candy.,"Marketing leadership has changed more than 4 times over the course of two years. Inconsistent, and indecisive. Lots of candy."
4,Design at Lyft,True,A great level of autonomy and support from co-workers,"In my particular department, projects tended to be constrained. Meaning easiest and most basic solutions (which usually amounted to not being such a great customer experience) so development could fit them into sprints."
5,Great place to work!,True,"- Team is like a second family

- Lyft leads with action and is committed to doing the right thing

- Laid back","- Team is like a second family

- Still in ""start up"" mentality at times"
5,Supervisor.,True,Lyft is an excellent company to work.,I can think of no cons.
1,Don't recommed this job,True,"Helps your resume 

Generous time off","Incredibly low pay for the amount of work required, to add to this there is no pay structure, I would not recommend this job as it is dead end.



Managers play mental gymnastics with you.



Constantly plays the ""were a family card""



18$ an hour to be a project manager



Hive mind with management"
4,review,True,i like to see dogs,getting layed of during covid
1,Organizational Failure,True,"If you're in the right position, they'll support you","As a growing company, Lyft was unable to effectively structure my department which produced serious and debilitating work conflicts. Also, my particular manager was arrogant and lacking in management skills. They seem to care more about prestige and status than actual functional performance abilities. I'm sure my manager had never managed employees before, and as such created a sometimes hostile work environment."
3,"Start-up culture, very chaotic, yet a lot of ownership",True,"Because the team runs pretty lean, you get to own a lot and get a lot of great experience especially building from the ground up","Chaotic environment with a lot of turnover at all levels, including exec level. Org structure could be improved. Morale is not great."
4,"Mission-driven, strong leadership, competitive",True,"Compared to other companies of its size, the leadership team did not shift as much as I would have expected - especially for a younger company. John and Logan are great leaders - transparent, authentic, doing what's right. Lyft made me felt like I belonged and I was always challenged in the competitive environment. Strong values -- they were always emphasized and reiterated, not just messages on the wall. If you care about transportation and redefining cities around people instead of cars, Lyft is the best company you can work for in this space.","More junior folks trying to prove themselves; always felt like they needed to voice their opinion. Growing pains in terms of high-growth startup pre-IPO years, so processes would shift all the time and cause a ton of churn."
5,Very Transparent,True,Lyft is very transparent about their intentions,Things change fast without much warning
4,Lyft really cares about its employees.,True,"- Culture, people come first. If your miss a metric or a goal. No worries, just hit it next week.

- Snacks, daily lunch allowance, MacBooks, feeling of a tech company even if the role is remote. 

- I worked for scooters and it was Lyft first 4 markets. So it was pretty cool to drive around and say yup those are my scooters!

- You get to work with smart people that respect work life balance. Rarely will you see Lyft employees work more than 40 hours.

- Good comp and benefits, pay was higher then market. Great stock vesting schedule, Lyft credits (no longer offered), commuter benefits, free health insurance.

- Monthly fortnights with JZ and Logan. Its so cool to see the leaders in the company act like normal people. They would answer all sorts of crazy questions at the end! 

- Severance, I was laid off due to Covid-19 and they provided a solid 10 weeks severance plan. 

- Overall it was the best employer I worked for.","- Knowledge, I worked in operations and Lyft doesn’t know anything about physical asset operations. You would constantly be pushing initiatives without a real ROI

- No sense of P&amp;L for the market. We would spend $50k on a event to get about $60-70k in revenue. Not sure how this was ok for so long. 

- There was such less work that people would just make up projects and blow up every channel on slack just to be visible. 

- Slack, as long as you post messages in important channels. People think your doing your job.

- There are like 200+ people on central ops teams supporting about 40 local OM/OLs. When we would go visit HQ, these guys would split up one project into 3 parts, meanwhile at the local level your juggling 1-2 projects + managing the actual operation. This is all happening while HQ is cutting 2-3 local markets every 6 months. 

- Lyft HQ doesn’t respect people in ops. They think their pink app can solve all challenges.

- Higher level leadership would constantly ask us if we needed anything instead of providing actual direction. 

- Unfair layoffs, my team was laid off from a high potential market while they were currently going to launch a market which would only stay open for 4 months out of the year. Some OLs didn’t have markets for 6+ months and were kept on but my team was laid off. 

- No hiring freeze, Lyft cut 1000+ employees during covid-19 while still hiring externals. It would have been much cheaper and ethical to check their current talent first then offer externals."

Being loud is rewarded"
5,"Let go during round of layoffs, would still go back",True,"Lots of opportunity to grow and learn in the company. Was able to level up career substantially due to the amount of scrappiness all around. A lot of roles and positions are created as needed, so there's plenty of space to grow. 



Also, great people all around. Sometimes petty, but generally all very well meaning.","Main con is that a lot of people aren't direct and projects get stalled due to indecision. Some passive aggressiveness, but not enough to create a toxic environment. 



This unfortunately also extends to company goal setting, etc. Due to the indecisiveness, there can sometimes be a lack of clarity in direction."

3,App treats you like a child and is unsafe,True,"freedom over own schedule, no oversight","App has become horrible. It won't let you move the screen to see where you're going while your vehicle is moving. I understand this is supposed to sound like a safety measure, but you can't even click to see the address you're going to. App also moves map back to your current spot when trying to move to see where you're going. Also app won't let you text your customers in your own words even while stopped, for example, you can't type, ""I'm at the corner of Marion and 1st ave"" for clarity. Instead, you have about 8 prompts to choose from. In other words, many times you have to check the map to be sure you're travelling to the correct side of the street or not making a dangerous left turn ahead or many other things or JUST SEE THE ADDRESS WHERE YOURE GOING and the app prevents these things, makes me extremely frustrated, anxious and dangerous because I cannot calculate how to get to someone or drop them off. The app has all these ridiculous measures, NONE of which are on the UBER app. This is offensive and dangerous and stresses me out as a driver."
5,Mission-driven company with great people!,True,"The smartest, most collaborative and nicest group of colleagues I’ve ever had.

2,Dysfunctional and Inexperienced,True,"- Great benefits, although no bonus and no 401k matching

- Flexible schedules with good work life balance

- Things are always changing which keeps work interesting and challenging","- Leaders and HR people put in roles with no previous experience. Even the CHRO hasn't been a CHRO before, but Google experience gets you put on top at Lyft.

- Mean girl culture is REAL, especially in recruiting and especially for people of color. Gossip, playing favorites, throwing others under the bus were all qualities of the recruiting leaders at Lyft. These issues are never addressed and actually get rewarded via promotions. 

- The closed door promotion process is ridiculous. If you aren't out there brown nosing, you never get promoted. It's all about you who know at Lyft ."

1,Toxic and Hostile Workplace,True,- I have met a number of good friends through work,"- The environment is very toxic and hostile

- Oftentimes middle management is intimidating, aggressive and pushy

- Performance reviews are skewed with favoritism and inaccurate stats

- Even if you are incredibly overqualified for internal positions or promotions, you will be continually disqualified or denied those positions for immeasurable reasons

- Middle management and up are frequently given promotions and new titles without meeting specific transfer criteria(ie - time in role requirements, performance requirements)

- If you are an HQ employee, you are unable to report concerns found on social media sites (ie - drivers/riders making inappropriate comments or posting pictures of weapons in vehicles on their social media)

- Concerns brought to management are not investigated, followed up on, or taken seriously

- There is little to no training 

- Changes made to procedures are not communicated properly or in a timely manner

- After the IPO - financial matters trumped everything

- You are not a valued employee, but rather a number."
5,Great place to work,True,People are very supportive of each other,Communication can be a challenge since there are so many teams
5,Amazing experience,True,"Great culture, great benefits, very smart people",Grew very fast turned too corporate
3,Visionary And Innovative Company With Poor Middle Management,True,"- Company's Continued Growth



- Space for professional development (Lyft pays for online courses for anything you could imagine) (see cons, too)



- Company Culture: Lyft's Core Values are taken to heart (Be Yourself, Make It Happen, Uplift Others) (see cons, too)



- Unlimited PTO (see cons, too)



- Other perks: fully stocked kitchen with (relatively) healthy free food, commuter benefits, free or discounted Lyft rides, etc.","**MIDDLE MANAGEMENT**

Middle-to-upper management is inundated with people who have been promoted because of ""time in grade"", rather than merit. That is to say, even if a tenured employee consistently exhibits a lack of management skills, they will receive a promotion because they are tenured and have ""checked the boxes"" put forth by Upper Management. Excelling at your current position does not mean you are ready for the next. Though not universally true, this tends to lead to poor management and strained employee-manager relations.



**COMPANY CULTURE**

The company culture did an about-face around mid-to-late 2018. Prior to then, Lyft had a very ""startup"" feel, where communication and collaboration across teams, skip-level managers, etc. was valued in order to ""Make It Happen"" (a core value). In order to allow employees to produce high-quality outcomes, it trusted employees to perform at their peak, with a very ""laid back / startup-y"" environment designed to promote a healthy work-life balance.



Prior to and ever since the IPO, there were major alterations to Lyft's Company Culture. From personal experience, Lyft shifted from genuinely caring about its employees' happiness to myopically and solely concentrating on business outcomes. Collaboration with other teams (even within the same department) was no longer valued; it was heavily discouraged without proper authorization. Micromanagement became rampant on all levels of management. Work/life balance became a thing of the past. One of the Core Values (Create Fearlessly) was removed, as the need for independent innovation of tools and processes became stifled with bureaucracy. Even with **UNLIMITED PTO**, employees were discouraged from taking time off until it suited Management's needs."
5,Rewards hard workers,True,Smart leaders that are in tune with the business,You have to be able to handle ambiguity well
4,Great Company,True,"Great Company with good benefits, fair pay, and strong leadership",It is a very fast-paced work environment

5,Great place,True,This is a top  place to work,The food can sometimes be bad
4,"Good company, bad managers",True,- Good top level leadership who takes care of employees,- Mid level management is filled with incompetent managers
1,Pump the brakes,True,take your dog to work,"large egos, poor management, strategy changes every month"
1,Self driving division is spinning in circles,True,Opportunity to work on cutting edge technologies.,"There has been way too much industry hype about self driving cars couple years back when Lyft started Level 5 division.  Unfortunately, as we all know now, reality doesn't match expectation for this industry.   Have you noticed there is no company who has yet to roll out a rider ready AV car without a backup safety driver?



The management team (directors and above) are almost entirely made up of men who have no domain expertise in autonomous vehicles, machine learning or robotics.  They are buddies from their previous companies who failed to define and communicate any vision for the self-driving division.  The Level 5 management team lacks technical understanding and sets unrealistic deadlines on vaguely-defined milestones.  Sadly,  the narrative about our strategy changes every 3 months so if you are less luck, most of engineers' work become throwaway work.   Teams are running around in a circle, working on nebulous and technically unattainable projects that resemble pyramid schemes.  We have a hard time hiring good people because all the competent folks are going to the AV leaders (Waymo, Tesla etc) who are actually ran and started by domain experts in self-driving.



The stress level is very high in some groups due to the realistic deadlines and pressure."
1,Caveat Emptor,True,None. The job is mostly composed of busywork that you're told is meaningful.,"Illusion of autonomy. Confusion and lack of communication w/ change of command. Corporate changes announced from far above, never explained, and adopted through false consensus."
2,Community Associate in Express Drive at Lyft Denver,True,"Decent health benefits package, some overtime opportunities","Lack of diversity, poor communication, lack effective leadership, ZERO growth opportunities, poor financial compensation, toxic work environment created by ""managers"""
3,Technical Sourcer,True,"Fun culture, open communication.",Management was unexperienced at the time.
3,Search Elsewhere,True,"Food (only in SF and NYC), Somewhat flexible work schedule, Unlimited PTO","There is no recognition for hard work unless you're an L4 or higher. There is a  lack of transparency which causes confusion when working on projects at a local level....information is constantly changing and there is no good way of communicating out to the company. There are no advancement opportunities even though you are directed to ""look internally"". Everything is being opened up in the HQ office in SF, local teams will eventually be a thing of the past. The attrition rate is off the charts and continues to be an issue everyday. This used to be a great place to work, but since going public things have drastically changed."
1,"Unethical and hypocritical, with too much dead weight",True,The usual perks you see at any other tech companies.,"There's a lot of dead weight in marketing. People who do little will do well here. If you actually want to get stuff done and feel proud of your work, look elsewhere. 



The way they treat their drivers is a disgrace. It's disgusting how little they care about the drivers while putting up a front. While the drivers are literally going homeless, these people fret about their stock options while coming up with new ways to pay less for drivers."
5,"Great Place to Work, Incredible Food, Great Benefits.",True,"Culture, Incredible Food, Great Benefits",Have to wear double the hat. Not enough headcount
2,Poor Management,True,"Free breakfast, lunch, and dinner (if you stay late enough). Unlimited PTO. Flexible schedule.",Upper management was terrible and lacked transparency. Company culture is toxic as reflected by the extremely high attrition rate. Our department was often overworked and undervalued. Other departments often did not recognize the downstream effects of their own mistakes and expected our department to fix it for them.  Lack of pay raise and promotions despite working hard and receiving glowing reviews from manager.
5,CA,True,The company makes you feel welcomed and just like family.,I can't think of any cons
4,"Exciting, Rewarding and Chaotic",True,"The benefits here are fantastic. Flexible PTO, great med benefits and great RSU/stock/ESPP opportunities. Cool to be a part of something that has such a big impact.","Senior leadership, in some departments, is under experienced and it leads to inefficiency and frustration sometimes. Starting to become very corporate. Still had some growing up to do to retain top talent."
2,Politics. Poor Comms. No fun. Lyft.,True,-Working on a great product that people love,"-Lyft is easily the most politically charged company I’ve ever worked for, and in recent years its gotten much worse. The culture that was once there and made lyft well known is an ancient memory, and the current ex-Google leadership has slowly taken over the company. Don’t fall for what Lyft once was. Those days are long gone.

-Perf cycles lead to very very low comp increases even if you do incredibly well. So don’t expect much reward for working hard. Which you will be forced to do.

-Zero transparency over why decisions are made at the company. Heavily propaganda laden environment as well.

-In general don’t go to Lyft if culture, people, or pay are your motivators. These are now Lyft’s biggest weak points, and they will try to sell them as strengths. So beware."

-Excellent equity packages for FTEs","-Bad managers are not disciplined or held accountable, even when there is extreme turnover

-HR Investigations don't go anywhere and will not provide any results

-Questionable hiring and promoting decisions made in some teams

-Extremely toxic work environment (ex// leadership watches when you come and go from the office and how quickly you respond; public shaming is rampant so prepare to be criticized with all your stakeholders cced)

-No WFH (unless someone tests positive for Coronavirus!), remote work is heavily discouraged even if the person is sick/injured

-If you are a diverse candidate, prepare to have to work double or triple the amount that is expected of others to prove that you have value and accept that you will still likely be passed over for promotions (this may just be a symptom of a bad manager(s), but it's been going on for a long time without being addressed)

-Legal is an island that doesn't care about other stakeholders in the company, it's their way or the highway

-Hypercompetitive teams at Lyft that don't hesitate to stab you in the back, don't trust anyone"

2,Dying and Never Recovering,True,"Some really nice coworkers who genuinely tries to maintain the original Lyft culture it once was. I would say lunch, but they've been cutting back ALOT on budget for food and perks. For example, no holiday parties.","New executives brought in in hopes to reinventing rideshare to be more than it is, but honestly have not gone anyway since Lyft Line was created a few years ago. Constantly trying to push the wrong agendas such as not focusing on having a strong differentiating strategy or rather some weird gimmick like adding paper bags in rides for people to throw up in. Lack of creative ideas, tons of layoffs because new executives blame old teams for their problems. When more time passes, I swear these new executives and top management will jump ship after destroying everything that Lyft was before. Good luck with the new IPO, peers are now praying someone buys Lyft out."

4,Data Scientist,True,"Good Pay and opportunity to work in an industry building for the future. 

Fast paced. Smart coworkers.  Good ideas are valued.","Dealing with a lot of growing pains and don't have good centralized decision making or communication amongst teams.

Lots of folks who were leading a small start up environment aren't necessarily suited to run large organization with lots of reports and moving pieces. 

Wouldn't recommend working remotely - especially if your primary stakeholders, partners, and decision makers are in SF. It's a communication challenge that I think is too hard to bridge unless you're really willing to put in much more time and attentiveness."

3,Lyft Used To Be Great,True,Good financial compensation. Updated office equipment.,"The energy at Lyft is that of an Emergency Room - except without the life-saving justification. The culture started to decline once they moved toward being a publicly-traded company. If you're looking for a company whose public-facing values match their internal ones, this is no longer that company."
3,My experience with Lyft,True,Flexibility and you get paid daily,Tons of inconsistensies and delayed communication

2,Toxic Environment makes it impossible to get anything done,True,"- co-founders are incredible humans

1,Toxic - disappointing experience,True,"Free lunch

Office location with view of the Bay

Great Benefits

Amazing first day orientation","I joined the company because I heard about the great culture.  While this is probably true in other teams, the team that I was on has a very toxic Sr. Manager (my boss).   



She has no sense of professionalism and is a very bad representation of what Lyft is about. 



She has no people skills and no managerial skills whatsoever.  She constantly yell (yes, that's the right word), belittles, and mistreated her team. 

In fact, first thing in the morning, I could hear her yell at our Sr. Specialist who told me that I have to get used to the fact that our manager HATES her.  I have never felt that much toxicity in a workplace.  I could literally feel the stress at the back of my neck every day.  



HR has asked me to stay after I reported this.  However,  I didn't because I am not okay witnessing the mistreatment in the team.  



I have been informed the day before I left that  2 people in the staff left before I was hired,  and another 2 left after me.  Me and the other 2 that left after  were there probably less than 2 months.  



During the interview, the team will not say anything bad about the manager.   I asked why she didn't tsay anything, and was told  that she don't want to get in trouble.  They team felt that nothing is going to change because someone higher up in the org is protecting her.  



The problem has been communicated to HR in the past, but for some reason, they have not done what is necessary to get rid of the manager.  



This has been my worst career experience and would not recommend."

2,Over worked and underpaid,True,Freedom to work when and where you please,Rides are cheap. Majority of money goes into your car. To make alot of money you need to dedicate a whole hella of alot of time.
1,Beware! Although working in HQ is probably great.,True,"Benefits are cool, Udemy classes for self learners.","Community Associates are on the ground floor. Every change which are mostly negative for drivers, we have to take the full force of it. The talking points that are given to us are trash, we might as well put on helmets and boxing gloves and prepare for battle. The management is a joke, but the position is entry level, so I can see how they don't mind messing around the CAs. If you have no business sense then you won't catch on to how they treat us. Get out as quick as you can. Use the position for whatever you need it for then run."

1,Beware of management,True,"Coworkers are some of the best humans I’ve met and wonderful to work alongside. 



Solid benefits: Lyft credits, great health insurance, mental health care, snacks","Most middle management there has no business managing people. No proper background or training prior to stepping into management roles. Senior leadership and HR also enable poor (and sometimes hostile) management behavior by willfully dismissing it, or trying to sweep it under the rug by shuffling the offenders to other roles/teams. 



Change management strategy is almost non-existent: change is often communicated haphazardly or justified via a “start-up mentality.” However, Lyft hasn’t been a start-up for a while. 



Opaque performance review process: this is one of the most subjective and non-transparent processes I have ever seen. Mostly relies on people’s perceptions than the work or metrics. My team never received role specific job expectations from our manager, despite repeated requests. So make sure you’re friends with the right people. 



Poor pay incentives and few opportunities for career development: Lyft needs to do better in pay increases and leveling guidelines for career development in order to retain top talent."
1,Toxicity at its best,True,"free lunch, and nothing much else","they lied about everything the job, the ""be yourself"" and the career paths"
3,"Great company, little room for growth",True,"Excellent benefits, incredible teams. I love what Lyft stands for and the tools they provide their employees.",Going public has changed budgets thus limiting available promotions
1,couldn't wait to get out!!,True,office perks like free snacks and catered lunch every day. last year brought in sourcing team but we're still drowning,I've never worked on such a dysfunctional team in my life. turnover was constant mostly due to managers inability to lead. one manager had their team taken away because people were leaving and they promoted them to a job without a team because they have been here for so long. people that actually do good work and help others don't get anything unless legacy people like you
2,Beware of local sales at Lyft,True,"$200 Lyft Credits



Good Medical



I was given $5000/year bonus in stock, but they will probably take that away or decrease for whomever replaces me



The local team is very cooperative, intelligent, and supportive in Atlanta



Lyft tries to be a supportive and innovative company



There is a demand for Lyft by lots of businesses","As local ""sales"" you are trying to get companies to use Concierge. The platform is buggy though and it was often embarrassing selling to product when it doesn't work.



Even though there was demand, I was only allowed to pursue auto dealerships, so most leads were dried up within a quarter. 



Regional Managers are often ""yes"" people for the corporate sales Executive team. They lack the ability to view the obstacles faced within the local markets, aggregate data to make SMART decisions, and have very little experience managing people. They basically meet with local Reps or Leads once a week to tell you to hit your numbers and then go back to doing who knows what and collecting an easy paycheck.



Constantly told the program is unprofitable and that you should be happy you have a job. With a recession coming up, I started looking for other opportunities the first time I heard this in July of 2019.



100% goal attainment is impossible. No one is meeting their goals this month. With a sliding comp, the salary makes high $60ks to low 70ks. A year ago the position paid six figures when it was more in line with driver recruitment."
3,Good company but falls short,True,"The majority of the company culture is enjoyable to work in. Open working spaces, casual work clothes environment, and benefits to keep you baited in. Eg. Medical coverage and food on site.","Management fails to support teams, the pay structure is below other companies and the promotion track is unclear with lots of bias promotions to people who have ins."
1,Hardest Customer Service Job,True,"- The team members 

- commuter benefits","- management listens to corporate rather than listening to the team who has experience with the operational issues on day to day basis 

- face to face support: You'll see drivers from all walks of life. So don't be surprised if you get yelled at, threaten, or belittled. That is when your not teaching the drivers the different between what an email or text message is. Or teaching them how to send an email. This job requires very much of you with pay that is not sufficient."
4,Good workplace,True,They are growing company,Need to update their softwares
1,Terrible Management,True,"Benefits like vision, dental, medical, and mental health","Managers don't listen, are insecure, and ineffective. Racial and gender bias goes completely unchecked."
3,Not paid enough,True,Work environment is pretty awesome. The company does a good job at keeping employees happy by providing lunch once a week and team outings every quarter.,We are the face of the company. We should live and breathe customer service. But the type of drivers and situations we have to deal with are pretty crazy. I don't get paid enough to get yelled at something that is totally out of my control.
3,CA,True,"I love my co-workers, awesome benefits, and lots of learning opportunities.","Hard to move up even if you have a lot of experience prior to coming on board, low pay, since they have gone public a lot of things are being cut. Decrease in pay to our drivers has made them increasingly volitile and unhappy we get to be the face they complain to about everything they are unhappy with and it gets overwhelming especially if you are a CA in the express drive location."
1,The Worst,True,They have great cultural values and on the surface everything looks awesome. Food is good.,"The infrastructure at Lyft was not built on solid foundation and has since grown into an extremely broken system. Because of this everyone is out for themselves. HR is overworked and does not know how to handle employee concerns or complaints. Inclusiveness is a myth that is perpetuated throughout the company.  Lots of overworked people are at the company trying to not get backstabbed. 



Instead of fixing broken systems Lyft hires people from Google to again perpetuate the myth that Lyft is as great as Google and therefore can be trusted. They can't. 



Would not be shocked if Google acquired Lyft."
5,Good place to work where you set your own schedule,True,"You can set your own schedule. You can work, days or evenings and even holidays if you'd want to. Customer service is outstanding",You have to love to drive and be a people person or this isn't for you. Can't mind going into airports either or driving in the city. If you work regularly you'll make good money. Must have patience because some people can be testy when they think they'll be late
5,Amazing company to work for at your own time and pace.,True,"You are your own boss



You make as much as you wish and/or desire",If the person is not self-motivated then she won't be successful in this job.

Lot's of support for those who want to advance their careers within the company.","Awful communication from top to bottom. Processes always change, rules always change, and nobody seems to have a definitive answer for anything. We get told  ""that's what it's like working at a startup!"" - but this feels like a bigger issue. It's like no one really knows what's going on and this company is flinging mud at the wall and hoping something sticks. We receive 30+ emails per day and we are expected to sift through these for updates to policies and handling procedures.



There is also a strong emphasis on left-leaning politics which Lyft attempts to inject into our personal lives. A few months ago there were flyers all over the bathrooms which among other things, encouraged  us to ""follow people from underrepresented groups"" on social media. I found this to be extremely weird and condescending to the people that they were asking us to follow. What does this have to do with ride share? I'm just trying to use the bathroom!"

There are next to no promotion opportunities because of weird lyft politics and requirements of how long you need to be in a certain role, as well as 'leveling' issues restricting you from certain opportunities even if youre qualified. Avoid avoid avoid."
4,Great place to work with a little nuances!,True,"Transparent, great people to work with, a lot to learn, great company values, the company really pushes for their employees to succeed, they have great benefits. PTO for full time workers is unlimited and for hourly workers the pto is still pretty good. Last time I was there they had free lunches and credit for Lyft but I think that has changed now. They have good health benefits. The environment is really welcoming. Full stocked kitchen, team building exercises, funds for holiday and cultural parties.  You really feel like you are a part of something big, and everyday is exciting, fun and inspiring. Everyone there was a big family with similar shared values. You were encouraged to be yourself. I really enjoyed my time at Lyft and I would go back given the opportunity. Everyone was responsible for they work they did.","They give their employees a lot of work.  One of the operations exec was really arrogant, rude and condescending to others. Upper management seriously lacks diversity. In fact the whole company lacks diversity. You will only find diversity in the hourly jobs. Sometimes things can be very disorganized, and chaotic not in a good way but in a very bad way.  Lyft is not pro-active instead they tend to follow behind Uber, which was very discouraging because this company has potential. They hired a lot of people in upper management who had no idea what they were doing here.  Cramped office space that often made things awkward at times.  There were communication problems within the company."

4,Good place to start out,True,"The office culture, the people you work with","Only get a raise once a year, not many places to move up"
1,Do Not Take This Review Lightly,True,"Without a doubt you will never work with better people who are not part of leadership. I have made some incredible friends that I still speak with and see regularly. I have never been employed at a company where that happened. The benefits are by far some of the best I have ever had. Insurance options, PTO, Sick Time, and Commuter Benefits are very generous and start on day one of employment.","Management is potentially the most inefficient, inept, and ignorant group of people that I have had the misfortune of having as supervisors. Hiring Team Leads who are outside hires with zero experience/background in anything Lyft/Technology/Transportation led to an environment that caused deception and flagrant violations of their own code of conduct. 



All of this occurred while I was employed at Lyft, sexual harassment, hostile workplace, and discrimination based on sex, race, etc. HR is inefficient and ineffective because the HR persons did not care for, listen to, or protect employees concerns. Those that went to HR were retaliated against by their supervisors with zero fear of consequence.



Upward mobility happens only if you are a member of the “Good ole boy” team. Unqualified persons were promoted with regular occurrence. This hiring practice caused a backlog of tickets needing to be seen and resolved. On three different occasions the backlog was reduced to zero tickets with agents in available waiting to take a call. Again because leadership was unable to manage with any effectiveness the backlog would grow again."

1,"Community Associate

Terrible Company | Horrible Growth | Awful Compensation",True,"- Local management is amazing, caring, supportive and they really want to develop you

- Employees get great benefits, including medical, dental, Vision, PTO, sick time, 401k, etc.

- Great team with amazing coworkers","- No growth

I have a BA and have been here for two-and-a-half years and I make less per hour than the day I started. I switched regions from SF to LA, but have been told I’m “killing it” maybe a thousand times, and after a year-and-a-half on the SoCal team as one of the top performing CA’s (with a BA), I still am 50 cents short of the rate I started at. Last performance evaluation I received a 50 cent raise when I had been asking for a dollar raise for six months, now a year, and Lyft has done NOTHING for me as an employee to increase my compensation and growth within the company, despite my consistent top performance. The best part is the way the company is structured, I have to wait until February just for a shot at a promotion or raise, no matter what work I put in. This company has TERRIBLE GROWTH and DOES NOT compensate its employees for the value we bring.

- Compensation is too low

I am part of a top-ten performing team in the nation. I’ve never seen one bonus come my way and employees who have put in years of work received less than a dollar raise. Terrible compensation for the value we bring.

- Work out of Pep Boys

I’ve been working out of pep boys for more than two years, while being underpaid. Do yourself a favor and avoid working for Lyft out of Pep Boy’s.

- Too much competition

This isn’t a startup anymore, the company is full of employees competing to move up because there aren’t enough business needs to promote CA’s. 

- Fake values

One of Lyft’s values is “Make it Happen!” Seeing as I’ve been fighting for a $1/hr raise for over one year, after already making that amount, putting in more than two years at the same company, consistently performing at the top of our team AND I have a BA, this company value is simply fake and not real. Lyft can’t “make it happen” for most of its drivers or employees, but likes to say these words for marketing purposes and to look cool.

- Lack of Support

We had support channels, which we use daily for support cases we work on for Lyft drivers, but they took them down. I’ve had to keep drivers waiting for hours since this change because certain support cases require word from higher up people, who may be unavailable. The old channel had agents constantly responding to requests, which keeps wait times low for drivers and thus happier drivers.

- Support screws drivers all the time

I’ve seen so many drivers screwed and not receive bonuses. I’ve had a driver wait an hour-and-a-half for a $5 cancellation fee she felt she deserved, but she was denied. I’ve worked with drivers who waited over 30 minutes for a pickup that didn’t receive a cancellation fee, which I wasn’t able to grant. This is far too common now and I see drivers consistently getting screwed out of cancellation fees and other bonuses. Drivers are also being deactivated at a much higher rate now, so get excited for angry drivers and frustrating support cases.

- No understanding of how to grow

As I mentioned, I have a BA, am told I’m one of the top ppl on my team, have excellent numbers, and I have NO IDEA how to get promoted. Because of the structure at Lyft, February is the time to get a promotion and if you miss it, you’re screwed until next year, unless a brand new business need develops. Lyft loves talking about all the opportunities to come and all the growth, but we CA’s have no clue how to get there. It used to be about taking projects (outside of the standard job duty) but now they want to make it about numbers... If that’s the case, I should be promoted one year ago.



Being a Community Associate is a GIANT waste of time. Be careful or you might end up like me, unhappy being told you’re so great, while receiving no additional compensation bonuses or raises. If working in a Pep Boy’s for years sounds like fun and 50 cents sounds like a good raise to you, then apply for Lyft to be a CA."
3,Well intentioned but chaotic,True,CEO is  well intentioned. Culture is generally friendly.,"Lack of direction around goals for marketing, stemming from unclear expectations from senior leadership. As senior leaders have been brought in from outside, politics and in-fighting continue to grow."

4,Customer Experience,True,"Most of your coworkers are great and there to support each other, great office downtown, lots of snacks.","Seen as a number rather than a person by upper management. They pretend to listen to the concerns or advice by the CEAs, but when it comes to changes they typically do the opposite.

3,"Good perks, horrible pay",True,Constant change and quickly growing,"Pay is horrible. For people who have families, student loans, mortgages etc, it is barely a living wage. For a position that requires intimate knowledge of the platform and the acumen to support drivers 9 hours a day, you would think that Lyft would pay them a reasonable wage."
3,"Great People, Subpar Management",True,Truly some of the best people I've ever worked with. It's an exciting time for the product and the company is in hyper growth so there is a lot to do and a lot to learn.,Management is not the best at all levels. Transparency is extremely low for everything from high level questions about diversity all the way to personal development and reviews.

1,Short ceiling,True,Co-workers are the only pro to this job,"No room for growth



Biggest Market in the country but treated like the smallest 



All other Markets have stand-alone locations



LA Markets leave employees out in the field with less than desirable work conditions in the back of a Pepboys with their Tire stock.   



Being asked to do tasks by Management, only to have them procrastinate on the follow through and never give materials to bring tasks to completion.



Benefits switched and cost increased far more than wages increased. 



No matching on stocks or 401k  (They're a billion dollar IPO business) 



Emotional punching bag for all drivers that aren't having a great day, with no intention of fixing the issue."

2,Increasings politics and lack of process are killing the culture,True,"Free food, good health benefits, Lyft credits, hot brand that has truly untapped potential","COO came over from Tesla and installed his supporting cast of leadership, which is destroying the culture (just see Lyft's ratings trend from Feb 2018 onwards). Leadership (director level and above) focused on land grabbing, infighting, and territory expansion. Feels like morale is dead after recent re-org that led to layoffs that came out of nowhere right before employees would have vested, and saw those with the loudest voices and most visibility promoted (over merit).



Company has two marketing orgs for some reason which leads to unnecessary tension, and aforementioned land-grabbing is a blocker from consolidating and having one cohesive team -- the re-org did nothing to solve this.



For a 5,000 hc company, the lack of processes is absolutely SHOCKING -- and then we wonder why there's so much duplicative effort and people feel like others are trying to do their job. We tend to have no work life balance, which would be OK in other fast growth companies but we could avoid this if we were better about planning and processes (kind of important for a 5000 person public facing company)"
4,"Great company, growing pains",True,"Great company values, excellent work space, opportunity for growth",Change happens quickly and sometimes there is little to no direction in new positions or positions where a lead has been promoted

5,Lyft me up...,True,Fun place to work. People are enthusiastic and ready to help. Great perks and benefits.,Salaries could be higher and possibly add bonuses depending on how you perform.
5,Great Fun,True,Lots of different friendly folks,Not sure if there are any
2,Disappointed,True,The company as a whole has a great vision and great values. It's an easy company to believe in. The office is pet friendly and has great snacks.,"They believe that the pay is competitive, but it's only competitive based on title and not actual work. There is an incredibly large gap in pay between hourly employees and salaried employees (over $20k difference). The level of work that most team members are doing is not reflective in title or salary, which makes it difficult when job hunting, because the title is not equivalent to the work at other companies.



For promotions, they have guidelines  in place that you must be in your position for at least 1 year before you can apply for another position. If another position comes up that you are the most qualified for and are currently the most senior on your team, you cannot apply for it if you have not met this 1 year requirement. This allowed for less senior team members to apply for and receive a promotion, even though they weren't the most senior and may have been passed up for the previous promotion. It was incredibly discouraging and management did nothing to resolve the issue.



We were encouraged to speak up about issues, but were rarely actually heard. We were frequently met with very political responses, but no real action. Myself and my team members often went to management and senior management to address issues. I even went to HR with concerns and no action was taken by them either. It was incredibly disappointing to be encouraged to surface concerns, but never see any resolutions provided by leadership.



Leadership rarely had any clear vision. Every issue was always an emergency and you were expected to switch focus quickly while never completing a project. It made it impossible to work toward a goal or stay aligned with the team.



The Customer Experience management team are salaried and are able to check email out of working hours. Often, hourly employees are sent emails on weekends or non-working hours and are expected to receive the update. Hourly employees cannot check email outside of working hours, which makes updates impossible.



There are opportunities for learning and development but they are rarely spoken of and most team members are completely unaware of them.



Since I have left, I have heard of no improvements to the team and have heard of more team members looking to leave.



I wanted to stay at Lyft as long as possible and was absolutely heartbroken to leave, but I couldn't work in these conditions anymore."
5,Fantastic company to work for if able to adapt to change,True,"High-growth company, great benefits for salaried employees, ever-evolving business that provides varied opportunities","Lots of change. If you cannot embrace change, this is not the company for you."

Focus on feelings and sentiment over practicality and  quality (ie things like car quality)



Not sure what the local teams do and why we have so many of them. People get defensive when this is asked. It's not like we are managing different countries with different cultures, this is cities in the same country.



Not a fun environment. I don't see many people hanging out at work. It feels super politically correct and sjw.



Supporting functions like marketing and ops aren't that good"
5,Fantastic vision and energetic leadership,True,"-Huge opportunity for impact all across the company

5,Community Associate,True,"Good pay, genuinely helpful management, full benefits",Deal with irate drivers very often.
1,The culture doesn't AT ALL reflect its ideals. WORST experience,True,"High growth, interesting working, great office, good perks","In my one year there, the theme that repeatedly showed up is that in such a high growth phase, there is no process in place to think about you as an employee. They couldn't care less about you.

Executives repeatedly speak about the culture of the company: uplift others, make it happen, but the reality is a)  uplift others in practice is more like uplift yourself, bc whoever does the best job of marketing themselves is probably staying and b) Make it happen doesn't at all play out in practice, bc the politics and bureaucracy make it close to impossible to get anything done. 



And the real kicker was we had trainings on workplace harassment, but when I had a hostile workplace where I was bullied for 8 months by my manager, HR did shockingly little to protect me, and said ""work on the things they've asked you to""



And to add to that, our entire team was laid off 1 month before my vesting mark, pre-Ipo, with no notice. Being an international on an H1-B, that leaves me with &lt;30 days to find a job (30 more days of paperwork), or I will be forced to leave after 20 years of being here. 



I wouldn't wish this experience on my worst enemy."
2,Would avoid until they become more established,True,"-Ability to learn a lot

-Lunch on Friday's

-I think the culture and company is great in the United States","-Extremely underpaid. Making  $5-10 less than other people in the same role. They claim it's because of the market. Yet Toronto &amp; Ottawa make the same hourly rate when costs of living aren't even remotely similar. 

-There is no line of what clear responsibilities and expectations are. You will be doing the job of a title 3 or 4 ranks higher than you. Then you cannot skip a step once it comes to any sort of promotion.  They do 2 times of year when you are eligible for said promotions. There is only two real positions you can take from this job (after you've been there for over a year.. depending on when your start date was because they only promote twice a year). 

-Management is all over the place. They will make promises they cannot keep. They promise room for growth when end of the day they make you take on more and more responsibility and don't offer any extra compensation to accommodate. 

-The culture is trash. You will be micromanaged. The negative energy in the hub is depressing."

3,Incredible Benefits,True,Benefits are fantastic from insurance to snacks.  Casual office environment is easy to be comfortable in.,Company has a serious lack of structure and accountability.

4,Community Associate,True,"great benefits, good team, supportive",not much growth or career development
2,Start Up Growing Pains,True,"-Co-workers are the best support system you've got there. There is a total team vibe here. You have each others backs for the most part.



-Snacks/food assortment is pretty good. Minimizes how much you would spend downtown trying to get lunch and all that. But don't count on that for too long as when a start-up company goes public, they drop all of these types of fringe benefits.



-You're held accountable for YOUR work. Because team members aren't pulling their weight doesn't affect you but you're also not micromanaged depending on your Team Lead.



-Provide grandfathered employees lyft credits. New employees moving forward only receive 20% off of their rides.



-If you're the empathetic type of person, you feel like you're helping people resolve problems and that can be gratifying to a good degree, but cooler heads prevail with angry customers.



-Some team leads won't breath down your neck. This job doesn't get claustrophobic. People give you space to be yourself and get your work done with a healthy dose of socializing as well.","-TERRIBLE workforce management when it comes to forecasting company needs during the holidays. Expect last minute answers when it comes to Holiday schedules. Lyft, you can make this better. Make it happen.



-Scheduling. Your schedule is based on ""work performance"" and ""productivity"". Which leads to the 4th item in the cons list. Don't expect to be given the schedule you want. They change your schedule every 6 months. You'll fill out a form saying what you'd like to work and they won't give you anything you've asked for. You'll need to schedule school and other things around their schedule, which makes it difficult to balance work/life when you're told what your new schedule is 1 week before. They'll say they need more people to work in the evenings and 75% of the work force will be given morning schedules. What gives guys? I give you the courtesy of requesting time off in advance and the favor isn't returned. 



-Low pay. Come on. Just about everyone in the downtown area is paying at least $18/hr starting. Especially with the gradual move to not giving new employees credits, people are going to need the extra money to pay to get to work if they don't have a vehicle in the already almost impossible to park downtown area.



-No one seems to know how the company produces numbers. If you're the type that wants to know what is comprised of productivity data and other information important to your performance, no one seems to know how the data is created. It'd be nice to let your employees know what data you're using to measure their productivity. 



-Transparency is like pulling teeth. 



-Parking sucks. Expect to park 15 min walk or try to fight the parking garage management to get a monthly pass which Lyft pays for but is seemingly impossible to find a decent garage that doesn't have creeps lurking.



-1 year to move up in the company. This is a pro and a con because they don't want a bunch of people who are starting out to move into heavier customer service issues but also it prevents people who really deserve to be somewhere else from moving anywhere they wish to apply. 



-Lyft credits. If you're hired in 2019, don't expect to get those sweet credits that Lyft gave to it's employees. You'll only receive 20% off of your rides as the new perk goes.



-Allowing people to be themselves also doesn't have to equate to using the office as a soap box. People openly spew their view on politics and other things you're not really supposed to be talking about in the office. Not everyone agrees with your points of view and to be quite honest, I can get on Facebook if I want that."

4,Security Officer,True,"Free catered lunch on weekdays, snacks, drinks.","When you are security, the Lyft employees treat you like you're a lesser employer.  They don't really interact with you in the same way they would with their coworkers who make more money.  Not all of them are like this, but I'd say ~40%."
5,Customer Experience Associate,True,Friendly co-workers and boss.  You can bring your dog in the office with you.  Working from home,Have to work school schedule around work schedule.  Sometimes can be difficult.
5,Finally a company that welcomes diversity!,True,Very welcoming atmosphere. Great Company!,None that I can see!
1,Far and away the least effective management team I've ever worked for.,True,"Most of the tools and softwares that Lyft uses are industry standard.

""Lyft"" looked great on a resume and I was able to get another job as soon as I started looking.

You'll learn a lot about how startups should and shouldn't be run.","Despite being a multifaceted role where you will ideally learn multiple aspects of the business and likely have more knowledge of the platform than most people you report to, there are next to zero career advancement opportunities in this role (I know coworkers who were there for 1+ years before I was and still have the same role they had when they got there).  The vast majority of my experiences in working with management (from my day to day manager all the way up to Logan Green and other SF based leadership I met) were toxic and uncomfortable.  Managers love to smile, nod, and say ""I hear you, but"" whenever you raise any type of concern, even if it could help the company in the big picture.  The company culture/attitude towards Community Associates isn't a healthy one and, despite the ""corporate"" labeling of the role, you're rarely treated like you actually work for the company- in the one instance I met the CEO, he literally walked away from me mid sentence while I introduced myself as a Community Associate (and, fun fact, it was my fifth day at Lyft; what an awesome way to feel welcome at a new job!).  Prepare to feel ""heard"" and never ""listened to""."
5,Community Associate,True,"Great company to work for. Lyft has awesome values, and seeing the CEOs constantly strive to achieve the company's goals while upholding these values makes it easy to be proud to work for the company.","It can be difficult to move up within the company, which is a bit discouraging."
5,Great Company,True,"Decent pay, great atmosphere/coworkers, and excellent benefits",The commute from my house is a little far
5,"Great people, fast pace, nice perks",True,"Lyft has a reputation as a ""nice"" company, and the people live up to it. People here believe strongly in the mission of the company and they're really smart, but the egos aren't out of control. The company moves quickly, so it's exciting to see your work have an impact. And the benefits are pretty good: free Lyft credits, catered lunch, amazing maternity/paternity leave, dogs at the office.","The compensation is a bit worse than you'd get elsewhere. (Wait, no 401k match?) So you're definitely sacrificing a bit for the privilege of working at Lyft. And the flip side of the fast pace is that objectives change a lot and cause thrash."
5,Amazing place to work!,True,"Awesome people, strong leaders and mission driven! I love going to work every day and being surrounded by such intelligent people.  Because Lyft is still a smaller company there is so much work to be done which means tons of impactful work for me. Perks are great! Especially being dog friendly :)",Don't have any negatives to share as of now. It's a great company!
5,An amazing company to be a part of!,True,"-Fast-paced, inclusive, and collaborative culture with so much room for learning and growth in a quickly changing industry

-Many avenues for future opportunities 

-An environment that makes it easy to feel connected to, and a part of, the overall company goals and successes. Actually feel good and excited about coming in to work.

-Pay is competitive and benefits are pretty awesome","-With how fast things are moving and changing, sometimes there can be a feeling of work going in several different directions at the same time, but really, that's pretty much the nature of startups in the first place.

-Work/Life balance is good for the most part, but there can be periods where that's not the case. But again, kind of comes with the fast-paced nature of startups."
5,Great company,True,Make great money and meet great people,Great company and get to explore the city
5,Love this company but has its growing pains,True,"-People are incredibly smart and helpful

-They hire all-star management with proven track records. The learning is fantastic.

-Our initiatives make me proud - easy to brag about this company

-People walk their talk

-Benefits and events are great

-Culture is amazing","-Grateful for the variety of IT resources but it's confusing about where to go for what and everyone uses a different medium, so you have to figure out individual preferences. There's also a lack of training on how to use these IT resources.

-Because the company is moving so fast, there are a lot of processes and structures not in place, so things are messy.

-Commission plans are a long stretch - rely on your salary, not commission. They change every quarter.

-Communication and transparency is not that great, especially around change and restructure. There is a disconnect between offices and between departments."
4,Long Term Employee based in San Francisco,True,"Lyft still maintains a great culture. From employee resource groups to supported learning sessions, I feel valued as an employee. As a rapidly growing start-up, there is also ample opportunity for growth and dynamic change.",With dynamic growth comes issues with middle management but this is expected when growing so fast.
5,Critical Response Agent Part-Time,True,"Flexible hours, great office culture, fun atmosphere, awesome perks.",I have not yet found a true con. Maybe the location of the downtown building. Parking can be tricky.
5,"Great company culture, fair compensation and work life balance",True,"Collaborative culture, stock awards and benefits, great brand","Less than market cash compensation, lack of tools and controls allows for a lot of 'waste'"
5,Couldn't be happier here with Lyft.,True,"Strong team environment. Everyone wants to help see you succeed. I've been surprised by some of the genuinely supportive and helpful team members I work with directly that also includes upper management. Progressive company. I am proud to work for a tech-driven, progressive company that encompasses progressive and forward-thinking views as it relates to business and the interpersonal relationships and lives of its staff. I feel accepted. I appreciate Lyft's inclusion efforts and causes they support as a company. They take care of their employees and make an effort to listen and provide feedback. Lyft's benefits package is one of the best I've received.",I can't think of many cons if any. It is a high performing environment. Be up for the challenge and prepared to put in the work for your success.
5,LOVE my job at Lyft!,True,One of the best cultures I've ever experienced. Tons of room for growth and direct impact. You can tell the company actually cares about its employees and customers.,Still in fast growth mode so some processes that don't make the most sense.
5,Great Place to Work,True,"Smart people, challenging problems, fun office environment, strong benefits",Steep learning curve; institutional knowledge feels overly siloed at times.
4,Great  mission-driven company with an inclusive &amp; uplifting environment,True,Product has a positive impact on people &amp; transportation.  Free food/catered meals &amp; diverse workforce.,Compensation is a big pain point.  Employee ride discounts would be great.
5,Great company to work for,True,"Lyft is a rapidly growing organization, meaning there are many opportunities for development. The company is made up of an impressive team with smart, accomplished, welcoming and passionate individuals at every level. Leadership and employees alike have an avid interest in their colleagues' and the company's success.","The company is in the spotlight quite often, so everyone you meet will have an opinion or question about the service."
5,What I think of Lyft,True,"The Benefits are pretty amazing, from the healthcare to the snacks and credits.



The company is also such a close knit environment, where everyone knows one another and is on the same page. 



The company is always trying to improve and innovate.



The company also takes feedback from all employees into consideration when decision making.","When you first start, you get bombarded with a lot of information and it can be a little overwhelming if you aren't used to that particular pace.



Since the scheduling is based upon company needs, you may not have the desired time off.



If you aren't used to  adjusting to constant change in policies and processing, the job can be a bit frustrating."
5,Amazing place to work!,True,"-Atmosphere

-Great benefits

-Perks (employee discounts, free snacks, dogs in the office)

-ERGs

-Career advancement opportunities",-Not enough formal training opportunities for current employees
5,You should work here. Seriously.,True,"My favorite things about working at Lyft are the people and the culture. I have never worked in a place that so truly embodies their values, and where you can really see them in each of your co-workers on a daily basis. Uplift others, be yourself, and make it happen are at the core of what we do and who we are, and the fact that this has remained true at the rapid growth stage we are in right now speaks volumes. Everyone is hardworking, and passionate about our mission, yet always willing to help anyone wherever they can no matter how busy they are. I couldn't ask for a better team!",No cons at this time
5,Lyft Company Review,True,Great culture and company mission!,Growth is rapid and tough to manage

5,Great company to work for,True,"Great work life balance

Raises

Great atmosphere and work life balance

Company truly cares about you and your opinion",Can be kind of redundant if you do not have other projects
4,Fun place with fun people,True,Fun place with fun people,Sometimes people are too nice
5,Pretty good!,True,"Benefits

WFH

pay is comparable with other jobs",Sometimes feel like nobody actually knows what they are doing
1,No growth,True,"Good people, easy work, chill.","No room for growth, disorganized, unprofessional."
5,"Great culture, but lots of red tape",True,wonderful benefits and working culture. Smartest people I've ever met.,Such an extreme division of labour and set of rules I eventually felt like I couldn't do much or my role was way too narrow
5,Great Company,True,"Amazing culture, people are very valued.  New ideas are valued and it's great to be part of creating the company from the ground up.","If you are coming from a structured environment, it can be challenging to be a part of a startup, need to be open to constant change and navigating the unknown."
5,The highlight of my career,True,"- A true focus and commitment to company values, both internally and externally

- Many opportunities for creating impact, project ownership, and career growth

- Incredibly talented, diverse, and kind co-workers

- Excellent transit benefits, catered meals, and monthly Lyft credits

- Great health coverage, including mental health resources","- Interdepartmental communication sometimes isn't as strong as it could be

- Better resourcing could improve team performance"
5,Great Culture and Advancement Opportunities,True,"Great culture, work environment and enrichment/growth opportunities. If you see something you want to do, the opportunity is there for you to grow into the role. 



I was hired under one role and moved to another role within 3-4 months.","Fast growing and fast moving may not be for everyone. Adaptable also can mean ill-defined, but common in a fast growing start-up environment."
4,Credit &amp; Collections Specialist,True,"Give back to the community immensely 

Clear future goals 

Full transparency with all employees

Great team and company to work for",Can't think of one thing
5,Office/HUB and best professional move I've made,True,"* AMAZING work/life balance

* GREAT company culture

* This company has some of the best benefits I've ever seen

* My management really appreciates me and lets me contribute to the company

* As the company is growing, I get to help grow with it. There are very clear promotion and career paths laid out.

* My office really lets me work in both a personal task driven environment as well as a team environment.

* The staff feel like family and are very supportive of one another.",* Smaller market so we get things later than bigger markets (but not the companies fault)
5,Lyft Cares!,True,"- supportive/driven/energetic people

- dogs in office/great food/office amenities

- great health benefits

- fast pace &amp; you're given autonomy to drive real impact if you build the trust &amp; respect","- no 401K match!

- role not very defined when  you first start (but this is being fixed &amp; in understandable given the fast pace so what you were hired to do could change in a few weeks)"
4,Review of Lyft SF,True,"I've been at Lyft for about a year, and I work on the People Team. Overall, I think it's a great place to work, for a few main reasons: 



1. The mission. I'm really proud of what we're doing for transportation and I think our mission translates into each team's individual goals. It's rewarding work!



2. The people. Lyft hires hyper-intelligent people to scale our hyper growth. Although I don't work with every team, the folks I do work with are passionate, driven, and fun to collaborate with. 



3. The culture. Our values are: Be Yourself, Uplift Others, and Make it Happen. It's corny, but people talk about these values on a daily basis. It feels inclusive (though there's always more work to be done for D&amp;I), collaborative, and exciting. Being a part of hyper growth is no joke (see more in the cons below) but we're able to have fun at the same time.



4. The ability to do more. I feel that you are able to raise your hand for more (new responsibility, new processes, new ideas) and explore things outside of your job description soon after your start date. Taking on more is encouraged (and in my opinion, good for career development) due to the speed at which we're scaling.



5. The office. I work in our SF office and I love the space. Open seating, lots of natural light, great on-site perks (food, dogs, etc.), a good number of programs and events. It's a comfortable and safe space.","Working at Lyft while in the hyper growth phase has its drawbacks. Fast growth results in disorganization, broken/sloppy processes, and overworked team members. I don't think this is a reason NOT to work at Lyft-- I just think it's worth warning folks about it. Lyft is still figuring a lot of things out (normal for newer companies) so if you work here you'll need to be flexible. I think this affects every team differently, so keep that in mind."
5,Great Company,True,"Company is very focused on personal development, and management (at least in my office) is extremely receptive to taking the time to discuss growth opportunities. Never a dull day, and I always feel supported by all members of my team. I really appreciate the cross collaboration amongst  departments, as well. The upper tier of management at the company is unusually transparent, and I feel aware of what goes on at Headquarters.","Not all positions are well made to fit into a clear career development path. Would not recommend joining the company at any entry level position, because there is little opportunity to transfer departments if you don't start in a field you enjoy."
5,Policy Manager,True,"Motivated colleagues, very supportive work environment, great benefits and employee resources",Not a con but you need to be self-motivating and able to speak up and manage yourself to succeed; no one is here to tell you exactly what to do and how to do it.
5,Amazing Company to Work For!,True,"- Takes amazing care of their employees

- Inclusive + accepting of all

- Amazing vision and core values

- Forward thinking

- Fun","- Since it is a newer company, the policies and technology are continually changing in order to figure out what works (which is great!), but it can be confusing to stay on top of all of the new changes."
5,Fantastic Experience,True,"Lyft is a terrific place to work. As an employee here I feel as though my thoughts are actively listened to and that my opinions and ideas hold value and are respected. It is one of the few places I've worked where employee collaboration comes first and foremost, and I believe that is a result of the general level of respect everyone has for each other. The problems we are solving are multifaceted and this makes for a challenging and rewarding experience day in and day out.","In order to make it happen, sometimes work has to take place outside of normal working hours."
5,Fleet Lead,True,"- Challenging

- Freedom to create new process

- Amazing team members",Work/life balance can sometimes become un balanced
5,Great Experience,True,Lyft is seeing terrific growth and I feel empowered to play my role in contributing to our success,Occasional lack of clarity around strategic objectives
5,"Good interview process, great role",True,"- passion about mission and product

- focused on employees and culture

- focus on career opportunities and development

- great benefits

- flexible schedule 

- work life balance

- very customer-centric",- lots of growth in a short period leads to some growing pains/disorganization
4,Company that lives it's values,True,"Lives and breathes it's values - be yourself, make it happen, uplift others 

Never lose sight of the larger mission - it's more than transportation 

The people are amazing!",Things move very very quickly and change often
4,Community Associate,True,Great opportunity for growth in the company.,dealing with uneasy customers
4,Operations,True,Great atmosphere and support,Not much room for growth according to upper management
5,Paralegal,True,"Great, collaborative environment. Supportive team members.",Unclear career pathways. Misclassified titles/levels.
5,Community Associate,True,Lyft is the only company you could work for and not feel like you're working for coorporate America. They value their employees and help us achieve success every step of the way. This is definitely a company to grow with. They are mostly flexible with my schedule requests.,"Dealing with rude, entitled people on the platform"
5,Engineering,True,Strong mission. Great culture. Top notch engineers. Everyone has a ton of respect for one another and the future is really bright with the stuff we're working on.,Not many cons. NY office is still growing. Dont see it as a con because it feels really tight knit.
5,Operations lead,True,"Very collaborative work environment, with a great company culture. The perks and benefits are the best I’ve ever experienced. You really feel like your opinion matters.",None that I’ve found so far.
5,CET Specialist,True,"-Benefits, Great opportunity to grow, Awesome environment, Inclusive, and Very open-minded for equality for all","-Fast-paced and positions change at a minutes notice, Interviewing answers about shifts differ from once you are an employee, and differential about pay for nights/weekends"
4,A double edged sword,True,"Relaxed dress code, flexible hours, unlimited PTO, diverse colleagues, emphasis on working as a team, and mission driven","Accelerating workload, few resources, poorly designed roles, intense personalities in management, and no 401k match"
2,Your experience depends entirely on your team,True,"Great company mission, not Uber","Your entire experience depends on your team. When a manager or team member leaves, it's absolute chaos. I watched many great teams go from phenomenal to non-existent in 3 years. Higher ups love bringing in old Israelis. Constantly playing catch-up to Uber instead of having their own vision. No great perks compared to other companies. Salary laughable."
5,Nice gig,True,"Dog atmosphere, friendship, good atmosphere, very supportive",If you don't like dogs - not good
3,Community Associate,True,Almost everyone is kind and helpful.,You have too many people to report to.  You never know who manages you.
5,Western Division Branch,True,Loved my drivers and my boss. Loved the investigative challenge.,Was a laboratory so logistics was in the back burner.
5,New employee,True,"Inclusive environment, room for growth, and perks.",No cons at the moment!
1,Lyft Nashville,True,"I used to enjoy working here, and I’ve tried to be optimistic, but it is no longer a place I feel valued or accomplished at anything. It’s a call center, even if you’re not working on the phones, you’re still in a call center.","If you’d like to be increasingly micromanaged and under-appreciated, apply here. When I say they’re looking over your shoulder while you work, I mean that literally, and people are leaving in waves for better companies in Nashville. I truly hoped I would be here for the long haul, but I cannot do so."
4,Critical Response Associate,True,"The people you work with are amazing, the culture is incredible, the benefits are amazing. The office is full of free snacks and dogs roaming around.  Overall a great office to work at.",The job can be daunting at times and repetitive. The schedules are not great at all.
5,Critical Response Associate,True,"Great benefits, laidback, free food, great location, Lyft credits!",I have nothing bad to say!
5,Cool Place To Work,True,Culture and Value of the company was amazing,No real growth in the company
2,Lyft is a good company but can be a great company.,True,"Great benefits, free credits, and genuine co-workers","Lyft is excellent at marketing opportunity and growth, but depending on who you are and what position you have at Lyft there is no growth. They give you development time as an associate to learn new skills but if you don't have some experience in the field you're interested in you won't get the position.  People in management don't want to take the time to train.  Also, management is great at listening to your concerns but are not great at fixing the problem.  There is a lot of sucking up to do in the company if you want to get somewhere. 

   Although Lyft focus is diversity, there are still biases when it comes to ethnicity and race at Lyft, people of color are getting hired at a reasonable rate but are also leaving at the same rate. Why is that? And, it takes longer for people of color to get promoted at the company."
1,Terrible. Two words. Politics and shadiness.,True,Free food and ride credit. HQ spoils employees. Catered lunch. It’s insane.,"Politics. If they don’t like you, your career is over. They will get you fired without a second thought. If you speak up and have integrity, this job isn’t for you. They want YES people no matter what is being asked of you. No communication with upper management."
4,Critical Response Representative,True,"they really do empower you to make your own decision when you are handling your cases. 

very forward thinking company

flexible schedules

benefits are on point",If you are in the customer service side then you are in a black hole. its hard to get out.
5,Great hiring process,True,"Great benefits, pay and and amazing atmosphere!",Have not found one yet
4,Operations Lead,True,"Great benefits, salary, &amp; culture.",The Express Drive start ups operate out of NTB and Pep Boys- it's dirty and there is no security which is a big downside. Not a nice place to work every day.
5,Customer experience associate,True,Everything seems perfect from day one,None as of now to speak on
1,Problematic business model with factory like office,True,They have a hip and cool brand,The office is like a factory. You will not want to work in their soulless building in SF.  And they are 2nd by a long shot in a market that is winner take all. Company doesn't have any long term future IMO
5,Critical Response Associate,True,"Engaging Workplace, Challenging, Great Benefits,",Always improves policies which sometimes gets confusing
3,The facade drops as the pay scale drops.,True,"Great culture at HQ, excellent colleagues and coworkers.","Zero thought put into career trajectory. Co-workers with the same job on permanent contract while others with same job were ""onboarded"" (and thus given full benefits) created one of the most uncomfortable working environments I have ever experienced."
5,Operations lead,True,Great interview Great process loved every single min. Recruiter was amazing ops manager amazing just perfect.,No cons at all perfection and professional
4,Lyft,True,Great people with great ambition,Not much room for professional growth in local markets unless you're willing to relocate
5,Community Associate,True,Thoughtful company with plans for the future.,Highly experimental company attitude means constant shake-ups.
5,Awesome,True,The positive vibes you feel throughout the entire building,I haven’t come across any cons
3,Lyft,True,"easy work environment, dog friendly","poor communication, high turnover"
5,UpLYFTing Experience!,True,"Employees value one another and work together as one team to accomplish goals and drive results as we support our internal and external customers. Work/life balance, great benefits, empowering culture, innovative and creative co-workers working alongside you - and the ability to truly partner to create and influence and leave your mark - just to name a few!","Lyft is located in downtown Nashville, parking is available and traffic can be heavier at times, something to consider"
5,Great Company!,True,"Competitive, great internal culture and work/life balance",Several open roles to close out which creates limited bandwidth
2,Don't Bother Applying. Lyft Hires Only  H-1B Visa Workers.,True,Plenty of snacks. Discount on Lyft.,"Lyft hired 172 H-1B and other visa holders in 2017. Almost all of them in Tech. Lyft's 2017 head count was about 1500. Of those, about 40% (about 600) were techies. That means Lyft almost exclusively hired foreign Techies in 2017. In 2018 (January 1 to July 7), they have so far hired 136 foreign tech workers - to the detriment of Americans."
5,Senior Team Lead,True,"Mission, Team/People, Opportunity to Grow, Leadership",Speed of business is so fast communications sometimes cannot keep up (not unusual for stage we are in)
5,Great company for building things,True,Lyft has a bottom-up culture where you are expected to manage your own work and make an impact on business. employees have more responsibility compared to other companies.,Fast growth leads to frequent re-orgs and uncertainty.
3,Technical recruiter,True,"Great culture 

Great perks 

Flexibility to work from home 

Unlimited PTO",Broken process around strategy
5,UX Research,True,"The most diverse workplace I have ever been in and on average, people here have a very high EQ. The company has a vision I can get behind and I feel like my voice is heard and appreciated.

UX research is taken extremely seriously here, unlike in some companies. And it's not just A/B testing; we do lots and lots of in-depth qualitative interviewing and are striving to get out into the field more and more, as well as running surveys and doing analytics on customer data.","Since the company is growing so fast, things are constantly in flux. But if you're entrepreneurial this won't bother you too much."
4,Great company but now hiring some questionable individuals,True,"Great benefits, great starting pay, free snacks",Management in the Nashville office needs training. New managers have been hired and are somehow worse than the previous managers. Upper management in SF seem amazing but should probably keep a closer eye on what's actually happening in Nashville.
5,Amazing company,True,Great employee respect. Very flexible,None. The company is great overall
5,Amazing place to work!,True,"Great people, awesome work space!",can not think of any
4,Senior software engineer,True,A lot of free food,The working hours is too long
4,Community Associate,True,Great values in the company with tons of room for Career Development.,Pay isn't great but great benefits.
4,Great Company to work for,True,"Company culture focus on diversity and inclusion. Employee benefits start on day 1. Management is engaged with staff and supportive. Focus on retaining great drivers. Great perks make commuting and life a little easier. Opportunities for advancement, even in non-tech roles.",Starting pay is much higher than minimum wage but still isn't in step with Bay Area cost of living.
5,Great company culture!,True,"Great pay, benefits and perks! Company invests in their employees!",No cons at this time.
2,Community Associate,True,"- $200 worth of lyft credit each month

- Free lunch up to $15 on Friday 

- laid back co- workers","The position is very deceiving! When you interview they emphasize on “customer service skills” and they make this position seem as if you are just helping the drivers with onboarding and some issues but it’s wayyyy more than that. Working is basically like working for a car rental company such as enterprise or hertz. You have to keep track on car inventory, accidents, cleaning and putting gas in vehicles and more. The hours are long and the pay is low for this kind of position and it is hard to live of. As a result, most of my co workers drive for lyft as well to make ends meet. Keeping up with all the vehicles with cleaning, gas, maintenance, repairs, accidents, etc is a lot and overwhelming. ESPECIALLY FOR THE LOW PAY! Also community associates get Chromebooks to work on as well instead of MacBooks or other better laptop brands. CA’s do not get the “Lyft Experience” that employees in the Hub get. Not to mention the fact, that all the express locations are outside of the city and a big commute for most people. The position overworks you and under pays you and their is not enough staff in the back of the house and front of the house. Get ready to become a human punching bag!"
3,Good Company Culture,True,Health insurance/benefits are the best part of the job,"-OL's and managers say that they are always there for you but usually, it takes a while to get a response from them on even the most simple question. If you're in a leadership position, lead by example, get your hands dirty and do the job that your associates do. 

-As a leader lead servantly, do what is ethical, even if it does not benefit you as a lead. This is how you gain trust in your associates and get them to want to work for you.

-Overall, there is a lot that HQ needs to look at in the local markets in the eyes of leadership."
4,Lyft,True,"Snacks, free lunch dogs can come to work. Growing company opportunities","Low paying wages there still a start up, so I get it."
5,Exciting,True,The company seems very very down to earth and interested in more than just ride sharing. Everyone I've met is super excited to be there and they love the workplace. There are awesome benefits and great perks too.,"The interview process is lengthy and nerve raving, but the rewards of getting a position with the company far outweigh the anxiety of the interview process."
5,Good Place to work at,True,"Dynamic environment, fast changing place",Lots of re orgs and changing managers
5,A company that walks the walk,True,"Excellent pay, equity, benefits, perks

Flexible work schedule, unlimited PTO

Supportive, inclusive company culture","Teams can get big

Takes a lot of effort to get things done because of scale"
5,"Great team, great coworkers, and a great company mission!",True,"Catered lunches and dinners, team outings, and everyone is respectful and friendly.",Lunch and dinner sometimes get repetitive
5,Great,True,Flexible fun benefits environment is fun,Pay is eh can be repetitive
5,Just awesome.,True,"Relaxing, make your own schedule, easy work, good money","Some angry people but not many, sometimes you have to drive a little far and dont always get much for it."
5,One of the best company to work for!!,True,"Elite team with engineers from Airbnb, Pinterest, Google, Facebook.

Flexible work hours, fun culture and mission focused work.

Cool perks.

Fast paced and extremely rewarding.",San Francisco is getting expensive day by day.
5,Excellent Hiring Process,True,"On time , professional and friendlyintereview process",Downtown parking is a bit difficult.
5,Product Manager,True,"Great people, Great leadership, lots of autonomy","Constantly changing business, challenging competition"
2,Huge Tech/Non-Tech Disparity and Poor Management Talent Fueled by Hypergrowth,True,"The people you work with are great and the mission is inspiring. ""Free"" Lyft Credits was one of the best perks, although not really free as they are taxable.","If you're not on the tech side of the company, you're a nobody... which is reflected in compensation, career outlook, and highlighted/championed company objectives.    



The hyper growth of the company has led to an increase of managers who never should have become managers to begin with; you'll find more people leaving their bosses here than leaving their jobs. There is no concrete process to identify or remove poor managers; which usually comes down to nothing more than one's word against the other's.  



The kool aid goes sour fast here as there is a huge focus on culture, without much action to back it up – especially if you're not in their San Francisco HQ office."
1,horrible experience,True,nothing - I regret joining this company every single day ...,I had a horrible experience working as an engineer in Lyft. Managers are real jerks. They expect you to work at nights and weekends to make what they promised to higher level management happen.  Many people hate their managers. People changing their teams after 6-7 months is not a surprise at Lyft. The only thing this company cares about is delivering projects at the cost of making their engineers work as a dog. Manager and PMs asking for status of a project late night or weekend is normal in Lyft.
5,Optimistic for the future!,True,"I was not a believer when I first started. Unlike most of my peers, I did not drink the kool aid. I was very reluctant to believe in the companies motives and their mission. It was my opinion that in the end, it was only about one thing, money. 



Thankfully I was proven wrong. After months and months of this disbelief, it finally hit me one day. I realized the company truly did care about their employees, customers and the drivers. I realized Lyft was interested in more than just profit but in creating the worlds best transportation. Everyday has been an adventure with new obstacles and problems to solve, not solely but as a team, together. 



Since that moment of realization, I've loved every second working for Lyft. I have first hand experienced the effects that Lyft has had on not only myself, but passengers who rely on the platform everyday to go about their lives and drivers who utilize Lyft for income, whether a full time job or just saving for something important to them.","There are many operational challenges that come with any growing company.

1,Disappointed,True,"Good benefits

Young energy.

Cool looking office.","Salaries below market rate. 

Lack of career growth opportunities. 

Lack of Transparency.

Middle Management does not exemplify the Executive credos or values. 

Heavy culture lacking in collaboration. 

Too many people want the credit for being the one with the new idea, as a result backstabbing and deceit run rampant through parts of the organization. 

Lots of disorganization throughout certain teams. 

This is still very much a disorganized startup, even if they portray themselves as a real company."
