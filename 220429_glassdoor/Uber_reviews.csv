1,Terrible Driver Support Team,True,Nothing is good about this company in Australia.,"I kept uploading my vehicle insurance, the driver support team kept rejecting my document. Guess what the reason is??

Renewal date which is 1 Jan 2022 does not OVERLAP my previous insurance which was 31 Dec 2021. No where I. The world insurance companies are overlapping their policies when you are renewing your insurance."

3,Too Much Bro Culture,True,"Benefits are great, depending on level you can get a nice stock option benefit as well. Unlimited PTO is fantastic benefit as well. L&amp;D is awesome.","I won't speak in absolutes, but majority of the time you will not receive that promotion you've been working 6-12+ months for if you aren't buddy-buddy with your manager or skip level. I've experienced it personally, and seen other employees experience it. This creates a really bad turnover experience a couple times a year once the perf process ends. Simply put, the people who didn't get the raise/promo they feel they deserved spend the next few months seeking it elsewhere. I've seen people get pay raises for lateral moves just by going to another company that values them more. That is partially due to the perf process not working the way it should. 



If you work here, or want to work here, there's a simple formula for getting a raise or promotion. Here it is:

Become buddies with your boss. 

Tell your boss everything you do. Even if it's something small like ""Hey, I made a new column on your google sheet!"". Apparently communication is overvalued that much. Communicate and document everything you do. Create an archive of all your work. Again, it's less quality and more quantity. When the perf period comes up, you now have your boss on your side and a huge running doc of all the little things you did.



Who do you ask for your peer review? Someone who will give honest, unbiased feedback? No way! Ask 1 buddy that works on your direct team, 1-2 buddies that aren't on the same team but in the same department, and 1-2 buddies that are in another department. If they don't know what you do, just send them your doc you've been working on for months! They can use whatever they need. Boom, you've got the promo! Congrats! Your middling performance doesn't matter, because you've mastered the system! Work smart, not hard (I use the word 'work' lightly). 



Maybe I sound bitter, but Uber has such potential that it hurts to see the culture being ruined the way it does. Oh and don't even get me started on the demographic breakdown. Outside looking in, the breakdown might look ok. The levels aren't disclosed though. It's safe to say 90% of the non-white employee is in a level 1 role. If you're new to this, a level 1 role just means that they have a job until a higher up department finds a way to outsource it.





Last thing I want to share is the execs transparency is non-existent. Something 100% isn't happening until it is. Something 100% is happening until it isn't. I get that companies have to turn the lights out on things sometimes, but why speak in absolutes if you aren't sure yourselves? Covid is a perfect example. Uber was absolutely not laying off or cancelling PERFs. Next week they do their first layoff wave of many. We get that Uber couldn't afford to keep so many people on when the business took such a hit, but why share news so confidently that you went back on within days? CEOs get paid the big bucks to be able to control situations no matter how tough. People were going CRAZY when Covid hit because the writing was on the wall, but execs were lying. Just flat out lying. Why have so many execs resigned? Transparency. I find it ironic that Uber prides itself on transparency with prices and safety, but doesn't really hold true on the inside. It's like a piñata full of garbage."

5,Good job,True,Very good job and you get to meet people,Long hours are tiring and some people can get rude
1,na,True,nothing to say about this,"no tips, long trips and no breaks"
2,Low Pay  Toxic Positive Culture,True,"Coworkers are great, always willing to help each other out.","Constant turn-over of management., Favoritism, and older employees are unfairly compared to new employees that are not burned out by the constant tech issues, ever-changing company, and attendance policies, and micro-managing."
4,Lively!,True,"flexible timing

pay is good

big teams","rotational shifts

less growth due to competition"
3,Too Much Bro Culture,True,"Benefits are great, depending on level you can get a nice stock option benefit as well. Unlimited PTO is fantastic benefit as well. L&amp;D is awesome.","I won't speak in absolutes, but majority of the time you will not receive that promotion you've been working 6-12+ months for if you aren't buddy-buddy with your manager or skip level. I've experienced it personally, and seen other employees experience it. This creates a really bad turnover experience a couple times a year once the perf process ends. Simply put, the people who didn't get the raise/promo they feel they deserved spend the next few months seeking it elsewhere. I've seen people get pay raises for lateral moves just by going to another company that values them more. That is partially due to the perf process not working the way it should. 



If you work here, or want to work here, there's a simple formula for getting a raise or promotion. Here it is:

Become buddies with your boss. 

Tell your boss everything you do. Even if it's something small like ""Hey, I made a new column on your google sheet!"". Apparently communication is overvalued that much. Communicate and document everything you do. Create an archive of all your work. Again, it's less quality and more quantity. When the perf period comes up, you now have your boss on your side and a huge running doc of all the little things you did.

Immense support that was provided to all employees when second wave of COVID had hit India was something I will never forget.

They have been suppressing my customer pick-up map for several weeks now. Instead of me being able to see all the  potential customers/riders they piecemeal a screen shot of Inactivity and the lowest possible surge prices.

Good benefits (free uber credits, top of the line health insurance)

Most of all of the other great perks like free food, game room, sales floor banter were only because the office, which we all work from home now and no one wants to go back to the new office","If this was 2018-2019, I'd say there is no cons, but since 2020 there has been so many cons that greatly out weight the pros. The reason why uber freight has so many open positions right now is because everyone is leaving and for good reasons. So beware before you apply:

- TERRIBLE pay compared to other tech companies 

- Job is really only good if you're a new grad

- No commission even though you're in a sales position (you have to wait until the end of the year to MAYBE get a good bonus)

- Like any startup there are constant changes in quota and job responsibilities due to inexperienced upper management

Tons of exciting, new stuff was happening (Eats was growing, Uber Pool was launched, we had rolled out Jump) and at the time mobility/ride sharing was fascinating. The people was amazing and sure the culture was fine – but if was a really cool, exciting company.","Since the IPO in 2019 it has been all downhill – IPO was a failure, round after round of layoffs, tons of projects have been shut down, the company rescinded lots of offers (which is really mean) and starting cutting costs and as a result talent at Uber today feels very mediocre (I actually barely know anyone who still works there). 



So yeah, Uber today is sad. One example of my time there in 2019 – within 5 months we had gone through a full rotation of product managers, in the sense that every product manager on my team (I think there were 7), was laid-off, fired or left within a single 5 months period. This doesn't feel like a good place to work."

If you are a salesperson it could definitely be good for you
3,Bad work life balance but you learn a lot,True,"The work you do at Uber is very interesting and high impact. You will get real life problems and you could be working on something that you will end up using next month. You get to solve a lot of interesting problems and really contribute to improving the app and user experience.



You will also learn a lot from working at Uber. The work really pushes you to learn and improve and forces you to learn fast and develop skills you never knew you had.","All the learning comes at a cost: time and stress. 



Ever since joining Uber I have been working till 10-11pm every single workday (and some work on the weekends). It's hard to imagine any working parent can stay at Uber for a long time because of the poor work life balance. 



There is a very high churn at Uber and your project POCs may change 3 times within the span of 2 months because people are constantly leaving, joining, or going on leaves. Sometimes it's extremely difficult to get any work done when the people you work with keeps changing.



Pay is low and not worth all the hard work."

Deeply co-working with very compact team members to seek the way to unlock new business partnership with supermarket, CVS, drug store or other retail key players. Super clear and open culture must be highlighted.","Busy, indeed. But, fun busy is far better than boring easy, right?

Uber credits every month plus health insurance and wellbeing benefits","Very long hours and working weekends and holidays. There’s very little work life balance with these shifts

Quarterly bonuses are taxed to the high heavens so there’s no way of getting a decent pay increase unless you get a promotion, where competition is high

No sick pay, this is shocking in the age of COVID and employees have worked while having COVID because of fear of income loss, which was fine while we were working from home but is scary thinking about if we were back in the office

Poor communication, changes are announced and then lack clarity and everyone is left confused

Massive numbers of staff were let go globally in a knee jerk reaction to COVID. Now that the business has recovered better than anticipated, which is a positive, existing staff are left to pick up the pieces of high inflows. Uber in Limerick is constantly understaffed now because people are leaving and they can’t keep up with the demand for more staff."

no commitment 

some tax brakes for tax time","wouldn't make this a full time job 

sometimes you won't get tips 

drive times can be longer and pay not worth it"

like minded team",Toxic culture No clear strategy Messy
4,-,True,Career Progression and Space for Learning,Strict Structure that is centralized.
4,A Good Place For Most,True,"- Benefits are very good for the space.

- Remote work is starting to happen more.

- Upward mobility is not only encouraged, but also expected.","- 90% of positions are still in office.

- So much growth has led to some confusion as to the company focus."

3,Decent Pay but a faulty system,True,"Pays well

You can create your own schedule by going online and offline whenever it suits you

You can decide what type of rides you prefer (UberX, UberEats, and/or UberConnect)","The map system is buggy and can be non specific at times leading you to the wrong location 

The app itself can be buggy and make for a difficult time completing delvieries and having a smooth workflow

It feels as though the company is solely operated by its frontline workers (i.e. the drivers, the support, and the tech team) while most of the money goes to the corporate workers and the shareholders"
4,"Maturing company, but moves fast",True,Lots of smart people. Moves fast for large company.

3,Solid company if you are L-ladder,True,"There's a lot of opportunity for career development. A lot of roles at Uber are loosely ley defined and there's a lot of orgs eager to train and develop entry level candidates to develop incredibly valuable skills that can make you very marketable elsewhere. Lots of personal and professional development and trining programs sponsored by Uber, especially for entry level employees.","Org structure for support level employees vs l-ladder or salaried, is very different. Lots of benefits cut off from s-ladder employees, slower growth/fewer opportunities. Essentially the company feels like two orgs, one with great perks, etc, and one with a customer support focus with very restrictive policies."
3,Working at Uber,True,"Growing company, interesting projects / challenges to solve - what you will work on will actually make an impact to people's life",Multiple re-orgs with changing processes - note that this is not an established company nor start-up.

one can directly communicate with mangers and also one can put their ideas on table for efficient management of driver partners",since i was into driver partner account problem solving front so had to deal with people who might not have any education background so it becomes problem to make them understand the technicality of things

5,Excellent company,True,"Uber is a great company to work for. One of the most important values is that we do the right thing, even if it could affect our business vs competition. Culture is great and people are always willing to help. Uber encourage people to change positions inside the company so everyone can have a better understanding of its complexity. Change is always happening, so one really needs to keep up!","Took 2 months to start working after they offered me the job. I was unemployed so it was really hard to financially support myself during that time, especially since I had two other offers that would've been faster. I would've appreciated a bonus or something for the delay."

4,Great vibes but under-worked,True,"Great food, cool office, young people",Does not value new ideas
3,Good if you're just starting out in your career,True,"Good place to be if you're early on in your career. Lots of opportunities to expand your skill sets (Analytics Academy to learn SQL, pretty generous professional development spend, etc.) and ample space to collaborate with different teams if you have an interest in working with them. The onus is definitely on you to speak up and make your long term goals heard but in my experience managers were very supportive in helping to get you in front of the right people.



The people here are also incredibly smart and genuinely a joy to work with. I also think Uber as a whole does a very good job of regularly checking in with how employees are feeling and taking steps to address any problem areas, even if the solutions aren’t always super timely.



Benefits/equity compensation are also pretty great. Just wish they offered 401k match.","The freight division is still in its growth phase and with that comes some expected growing pains. But considering that it’s recognized as a ""core segment"" of the business, it’s appalling how unsophisticated some of the systems and processes are for a tech company of this scale. 



There was also just a general lack of organization and a constant need to be okay with not knowing how the scope of your role or your OKRs might change. In my 2 years there the metrics I was held to and the cohort of customers I was pitching to changed 7 times. It was fine at first but over time it just became exhausting because it felt like things changed the second you finally got your bearings. It also wasn’t uncommon for you to start a new quarter without knowing what your quota would actually be until several weeks later. 



It’s also pretty common practice for teams/departments to hold short term competitions with relatively small payouts to incentivize people to work harder. There’s nothing wrong with this idea in and of itself but it always felt like a way out of just paying employees what they actually deserved. 



If you’re coming into it with the clear intention of gaining new skills and exposure to new areas I think this is a good place to be. Otherwise I think you may be able to find a more fulfilling experience elsewhere."

5,Amazing company and culture,True,The working environment is best. You will really enjoy working here.,There is no cons I can't come up anything.
5,I absolutely love going to work everyday!,True,"Very collaborative. Team culture is amazing. They actually do encourage a healthy work/life balance not just pitch it in recruiting. They also include health/wellness in benefits package ie reimbursements for gym memberships, running shoes, etc. Health benefits are amazing!!! Ingenious, challenging, and data driven. I am always optimistically cautious when considering a new opportunity, but this is one choice that has gone above and beyond my expectations.","We are bouncing back from the pandemic with a fervor and doing a ton of hiring. I do not believe we planned well for that and TA is feeling the pains of trying to keep up with hiring while also trying to add TA staff. On the up side, due to team culture, we are keeping up with demand and exceeding numbers."

Good entry level into sales","Feels like very little progression.

So much bureaucracy, doesn't feel like you can impact decisions or make change within the company even when your ideas may make your job more efficient. 

Unlikely to be made Full Time (hired externally through recruitment firm), so you don't feel part of the company and get no employee benefits (no Uber credits, but also no healthcare and other employee rights). They pay well so you aren't bothered by this.



The biggest con, is if you start to want to take on more responsibility outside of direct sales or explore personal development you risk your commission as you have less time to focus on this. Then you watch as others who are doing the bare minimum start to get rewarded for good results, even when bringing less to the team."

It is however so rewarding and you’ll learn and grow rapidly in this environment.
3,"Poor pay and politics aside, I learnt a lot.",True,Some brilliant people at Uber. You will make friends at work. You will grow professionally.,Credits won’t pay your bills. You’ll be underpaid (ballpark) 15-30k. You’ll be overworked - good luck ever agreeing on what falls in your “remit”. If you’re not an extrovert - you’re not going to enjoy Uber’s culture very much. If watching a circle j*rk makes you want to tear your eyes out - don’t apply.

Great job to have around study or other life priorities that take a lot of time.",The only opportunities for advancement that open up are in Sydney or overseas.

5,3 months being employed for UBER,True,"I really am positively surprised about the values and the working mentality in UBER and I absolutely can identify myself with UBER in many points. For example as an employee you have to solve the internal anti-discrimination and anti-racism e-learning courses and other relevant courses. I f you don't finish them in a certain time, you definitely get informed by your managers about that.

Also the wellbeing program and the monthly credit which are given by the company are very good things.

As for my second call today was because even though I made that one hour long wait and delivery I did not get payed for it.

Most of upper and middle management is completely incompetent and unqualified. 



Job descriptions are often vague, unclear, and overlapping. 



There is a ton of overlap between teams and departments that slows the organization down, creates unclear decision-making, and ultimately leads to re-work. Given the poor management, this has not been fixed in a while."

If you turn down 80% of requests and can do quick math to calculate the rate before accepting, you can make 30/hr. I do. 

Ex: 15min trip for $8-9, lots of half hour trips for $14-16, 40 min trip for $18-20, etc. this means only accepting trips with tips pre added bc base rates are low. You can aim for $25 an hour and post-trip tips added will frequently get you to 30.

3,Uber Salary,True,The company name offers a LOT of upside in the selling process. Uber was a pioneer in this field and are looking to build a better society for all in the future.,"Company is too large in my opinion. Sales do not get consulted before products are cut for the suite. Manager is great but doesn't have a strictly sales background. Manager is almost micromanaging, I dont work well with micro management. Previously before Uber bough Routematch technology my boss that I direct repotted to was FANTASTIC, but in the merge he got moved back down from sales management to a senior account executive, so it is hard not being able to ask for his advice as much as when I reported to him. Company culture is very different from any jobs I have held in the southeast. Although, it goes whiteout saying that the pandemic is well under way."

Tips can be bigger than expected sometimes","But those same tips help to cover the sometimes inexcusably low paying delivery that was likely the most difficult one of your work day



Not everyone tips! Meaning sometimes you actually make $10 an hour, which in Chicago isn’t even minimum wage, instead of the $38 they constantly advertise."

Uber has a put a priority on career advancement. We are encouraged to seek opportunities within the organization. Work life balance and quality of life has greatly improved with remote work and there will be a flexible schedule when we return back to the office.,"Attrition rates have been an issue. YoY salary increases are not enough. Talented workers get their well deserved raises by leaving to work for competitors across the street. People are using the fact that they work for a well known brand to land better offers elsewhere. Seeing ""X-Uber"" on people's LinkedIn has become the norm."
5,Great,True,Great place to be at,none that are considered major

5,Couldn't be happier!,True,"""Ideas over hierarchy"" is one of the key company pillars and they really do practice what they preach. I haven't been in my role for more than 6 months, however, I've already contributed to multiple projects that have had an impact across the whole ANZ market. 



They do more for L&amp;D than I've seen anywhere else - really investing in their employees. They also understand the impact of culture on a workplace and put money behind team activities and initiatives.","If you're not used to a start-up environment, you'll need to prepare yourself for the volatility of things changing extremely quickly - process changes, product updates, compliance/legal workflow, etc."
5,Incredible workplace,True,"Culture is incredible, opportunity to move

Into new roles, autonomy to take on and own projects, catered lunch provided, CEO is inspiring, product innovations daily.","If you struggle to work autonomously and respond poorly to change, it’ll be a struggle."

A fast-paced and challenging environment. I always feel like I'm making a difference.","Management is occasionally disorganised. On the odd day,  the Team Leads will forget to communicate things to the Greenlight Leads, so just make sure to follow up to ensure that it's actioned on time."
5,Uber for work,True,"Big company, you get good compensation and really good benefits... Software development culture is enjoyable and growth oriented... Good values like honesty and ethics are really important for them



Definitively a good place to work","As the company is big, work comes on waves, sometimes you do not have a lot, sometimes you have tons... Also, you may feel your visibility dissipated because of how big it is the company, in their defense, they are trying to avoid this, but they still have work to do... This last one is also true for the ""leveling"", meaning, working at Uber, you feel the ""levels"" they have a little bit, they are trying to avoid that, but still working on it..."
5,I had a good experience,True,"I joined Uber through Postmates acquisition. I won't deny that there was a bit of uncertainty. But the leadership ensured that the uncertainty was handled in a graceful fashion. Managers were very supportive throughout the process on both Uber and Postmates sides.

- Very fast-paced environment (you get to have all the control over your work from the get-go)

- cross-country network (you get to connect and work with people all around the world easily through Slack)

- Resume building (you will be working with some of the biggest firms in the food industry, which will enhance your resume)","- There is neither job training at the beginning nor reliable managers you can reach out to when you have questions. 

- Senior management team has no clear direction on what they want to focus on for the next 5 years. They also have no understanding (or never try to understand) of what people on the field (like account executives, customer success managers, etc...) are struggling with and still keep bugging you with impossible questions and quota 

- We do not have any market research team that is collecting customer/user data (which is unbelievable), so we are inferior to all the other competitors in terms of consultative approach to clients

- It is easy to take days off, but your clients could blow up your phone at 10 pm or 7 am on weekends

- Clients are extremely rude and aggressive."

3,COE review,True,"1. Uber allows to be yourself. You don't need any kind of pretense to work and collaborate with others. 



2. Fairly paid (I know subjectivity but still). However this is only for the base salary. I can't say that for bonuses and yearly hikes.","1. Culture: The leadership isnt invested in people as there is no definite intent for employee happiness. While there are systems like employee surveys in place, the drive to act and follow up is weak. 



2. Compensation: The promised compensation like company shares do not exist if you are in the specialist role. I did have it on my OFFER LETTER. But the organisation retracted it and gave a cash remuneration which obviously doesn't lead to an equivalent share value considering the company was going public. 



3. Unorganised approach: Was a bit shocked to see the leadership running a young organization in a very traditional way and totally lacked empowering young employees to innovate and pursue their ideas. 



4. Lack of internal tools:There are minimal tools to make your work easy. Especially when it comes to tracking your own productivity and efficiency. 



5. Performance management: Needs global overhaul in terms of standardising perf management system. Every team has thier own way of measuring performance which obviously leads to payment disparity. 



6. Hiring: Was promised a relocation support (cash plus other support) which I was denied when I reached the city. Moreover the hiring teams are highly unorganised when it comes to follow up on interviews, feedback on candidates etc. 



6. ""Mathless HC planning"": No teams have a math around how and why they need to hire the number of folks they do. They believe they'll be able to spin out a role for everyone thry hire but that's not true. This is reflected in the way employees are shuffled and shifted from one to another more too frequently."

You will meet great people inside there and they really make your time there better. 



Free food and snacks while in office. Office located in Limerick city centre which is ideal if you want to do some shopping on your lunch hour.","Communication. This has been a consistent problem during my time at the company and it has been highlighted in every yearly employee satisfaction survey. This was particularly evident in the redundancies that were carried out during the pandemic, with affected employees being kicked off the system with immediate effect, after reassurance that the process would take some time.



I was lucky I was not one of the affected employees, however, it really opened my eyes as to how disposable I was. This also resulted in 1 employee doing the work of 3, shortly after the redundancies were finalised, as inflows started to rise substantially and KPI expectations also rose, which were a lot more difficult to achieve.



Work life balance was also a challenge as the shift pattern consisted of 11 hour shifts, working every second weekend and changing start times every 2 weeks (8AM - 7PM &amp; 1PM - 12AM). Moving to remote work only made these shifts more difficult. The nature of the line of business required 24/7 support, however the shift patterns are drawn up in the most complicated way possible.



Little room for progression unless you make yourself known to higher management, which often lead to the wrong candidate being selected.



Interview process for promotions quite difficult with creative tests given and no preparation given to those going for said promotion.



Flexing to other lines of business with little to no training given."

* Objective and bias free management - culture which keep performance on top and hones talent

1,Great Company with a really bad support structure,True,Make your own shift. Start when you want to start and quick when you have had enough. Freedom. Its great really.,Done you ever have a problem and try to talk to support and ask for help. You will get none.

they have the worst management in edmonton where i think they can do really well if they have better management..one more thing the rating system sometimes not fair specially for ubereats drivers cause a customer may give you thumbs down for some reason that you cant know and cant even discuss"
4,Uber Driver,True,"No, No, No, NO, NO","Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes."
4,Great place,True,Great company with great people.,None that come to mind.

4,Fair,True,One of the greatest start ups,there are nothing much to catch
5,Life at the Greenlight Hub...,True,"- Management truly care about you. The support I've received from management at Uber is like no other I've experienced before

- The team is amazing. Everyone understands the goal and supports each other to achieve it. I've met many great colleagues here who I now consider my good friends

- You can be your true self at Uber

- Agile environment. Very fast paced and ever-changing. This makes working here so exciting

- Inclusive environment/management is transparent 

- Flexibility

- Encouraged feedback culture

- Free daily lunch","- Responsibilities are split between experts to improve efficiency, although not quite sure if this is actually improving interactions with partners"
3,Director,True,Innovation and autonomy and distribution,Culture and values and ambiguity
4,Uber Expert,True,"Culture is great, Inclusive nature",they Dont treat Drivers great
4,"Great Relaxed Work Environment, Amazing People",True,"Get to work with so many amazing people and make great friends. The young nature of the company means that there is a huge amount of change happening every day, and it's an great feeling to see a project that you worked on get launched in just a few short months and get rolled out to the rest of the world. The receptiveness of new ideas is a huge pro, as it allows Uber and Uber Eats to continuously evolve and streamline it's processes.","Although having a relaxed office can fantastic, sometimes it's a little too much, and it feels like more of a social hangout than a proper work environment."
3,The definition of a love/hate relationship,True,"*Smartest, most talented crew of people you will ever work with

*Perks like Uber credits and in-house catering

*Never a dull day -- you will learn more than you'd ever expect","*Constant media attention and internal drama is soul-crushing

*Underpaid and overworked

*The need to always be ""on"" -- it takes a toll, no matter who you are"
4,"Great company &amp; culture, management so-so",True,"- Great extras such as free food

- Great people

- Nice culture &amp; office","- The management was kind of full of themselves 

- They claim to be very open minded but heard two managers talk condescendingly about some of their employees. But I can't say that this is a reflection on the entire company, maybe it was just those two."
5,If you are willing to get your hands dirty and make a huge impact this is the right place for you!,True,"I could list the pros all day, but here is a select few: 

- awesome team: 95%+ of the people I work with at Uber are amazing and people, who I consider friends, not just colleagues 

- you can be yourself: want to wear shorts and thongs to work? this is the place for you! In my experience you can be your authentic self (whatever that may be!) 

- treated really well: despite what you might read in the press, Uber is not an evil company trying to take over the world. At all levels of the company I have found that everyone treats each other with respect and values their ideas and opinions. Sure there are a few bad apples, but the great people far outweigh them!","- it's a bloody lot of work: if you love to take things on cruise control this is not the place for you. It's definitely not a 9-5 type environment (and I hope it never becomes that!) 

- public scrutiny: you need to be thick skinned as not everyone will love Uber as much as you might. Whether it's an unhappy driver partner that you need to win back over, or a know it all relative at Christmas lunch, you will find yourself talking about Uber 24/7 (and often defending/explaining the company). It can be draining and you need to be ready for that. 

- crazy amount of change: personally, I love the pace of change, but it's definitely not for everyone. If you like routine and hate ambiguity and seemingly endless changes this is not the place for you. If you are happy to roll with the punches and make the most of every situation, then you will do just fine."
4,Overall I'm happy working for UberEATS,True,Flexible. No middle management to answer to. Good rate if you work fast and efficiently. Communicate well through emails to drivers and riders.

5,Challenging but exciting,True,"Awesome perks

Lots of autonomy

Switched on team

Stuff gets done

- encouraged to pursue/prove ideas

- Aware of problems and taking strides to resolve them

- best corporate parties

- high autonomy

- inclusive environment

- fantastic benefits

- Significant work being done to make the culture/values positive and inclusive","- compensation could be higher

- I've maintained a strong work/life balance, as the company encourages this. However, a large proportion of the work force at Uber do not. As a result, I have concerns that that is expected of me from my team. 

- Not all Senior Management in ANZ seem to be aligned on the future of Uber. We'll have to see if there's proof in the work completed over the next 12 months

- lack of consistency worldwide in job role. As a result, compensation is not necessarily reflective of work performed"

4,"Overall, great team to work on",True,"Teams, opportunity to work on large scale projects that have a global impact",Matrixed organization so there's a lot of teams and departments to navigate to get work done
5,Genuinely Cares about Employees,True,"I've always felt as though Uber has cared about my opinions even in such a big company. If I have an idea, it's encouraged to tell someone and higher ranked employees are always willing to listen. Lots of employee feedback is sent out, and if something isn't satisfactory, Leadership very clearly makes an effort to right the wrongs","Very high expectations for employees, but holding us to high standards is important"
4,Uber Eats,True,Fun summer job to do as a college student. Can use the app and work when ever you want. If you live in a beach town you get to deliver food to some pretty nice hotels and gated communities that you wouldn't have access to outside of Uber.,"Wears on your car, a lot of expenses go to gas. During certain months it can be really slow. Rating system is backwards. People can thumbs you down even if it was the restaurant that messes up their food without reprecussions."

-Having to explain tech issues and outages to drivers with ambiguous information

-Needing to balance explaining issues and tips to drivers without sharing too much internal information

-Having to deactivate drivers (sometimes only temporarily) for subjective reasons such as ratings and fraud false-positives

-Safety issues such as belligerent riders, drivers, and occasional instances of vandalism"

Great culture, casual dress code, young professionals

Great Talent overall, you will learn a lot from others","Hours tend to be long, but work is very engaging. It depends on what you want for your career really. Still way better hours than investment banking or consulting."
4,Not going anywhere!,True,"This is definitely a place where you can be yourself. Uber fosters a community I have yet to see in the workplace. 



Driver team Mgmt is super supportive of career goals and will figure out a way to get you where you want to be. Benefits (Work From Home + Reimbursements) are amazing - we are taken care of for sure.","There were recent changes to compensation but I'd argue that Uber still has ways to go with competitive pay. 



You can feel stuck in your role at times. Leadership won't necessarily come ""looking for you"" to move up or around if you aren't vocal about what you need.



Roadmaps to careers in different lines of business are somewhat nonexistent. Uber is making strides but mobility moves at a snail's pace. If you are entry-level - it may take a while to access a team outside of your line of business or of a different speciality."

1,Don't do it,True,"The pros were meeting people and talking...sometimes that can be fun, but that's about it.","I pretty much wore down my new Honda Civic and added so many miles for no reason...the pay kept getting worse, worse, and worse...It was my ""job""...and after a long while, I realized I never had a job in the first place...and it was so hard to bounce back from."

4,Brand Ambassador,True,I worked with great people and I loved my co-workers,I had to work long hours and it was exhausting
4,Earning More Than I Expected,True,"Set your own hours

Work as little or as many hours as you would like each week

Daily cash out of earnings

It’s possible to earn $1K a week or more if you live in a busy city or metro area","Can be hard to predict earnings because a substantial portion of it is based on tips

Must have a reliable vehicle

No tax withholding because you are an independent contractor

Must be organized and track your own expenses for tax purposes"

3,my experience,True,coworkers are very helpful and you get credits.,duties are always being changed and no necessarily for good. Many of the benefits have been removed.
4,"Great Pay, Great Benefits, Creativity inspiring.",True,"Uber has always seemed to need creative thinkers in order to solve problems. The kinds of problems available at Uber aren't available anywhere else in the tech industry. This is because Uber works in the real-world, not just in tech. Thus, many solutions need to exist to prevent problems from happening in the real world, and things quickly become much more complicated when dealing with people interacting. Not very demanding atmosphere, but the company gives you room to move at whatever pace you want - and the freedom to propose ideas across the entire company and tech stack. Even though I work mostly on backend development, I've proposed solutions to many other teams.","It has a fast employee turnaround rate, so, oftentimes, you'll be working on something that someone else designed, built, and left, and you might run into issues understanding the architecture of things / debugging flows because of a lack of understanding of the system / lack of a POC to talk to."
5,Great job,True,Great place to work great pay and benefits,Work all the time management needs help being professional
5,Delivery Driver,True,Flexible hours and the best app,No cons I can think of

5,Just An Amazing Job!! No Cons!!,True,"Outstanding health insurance. 



Competitive pay with bonuses and raises.



Amazing daily perks such as breakfast, lunch and snacks. 



The individual teams and the way everyone feels like a family is very motivating. 



The fact that my appearance did not stop them from hiring me(at the time I had rainbow hair) was huge. 



The culture and inclusion means everything. ERGs!!!



The company loves to promote from within and the trainings available really are great.



Company get togethers and awesome swag!



Love this job!! You get what you put in and you can really sore with this job. I was a driver and then took a chance and applied. I'm almost 3 years in and adore my job and coworkers!",The distance from the suburbs on the train early in the morning can be hard.

Compensation used to be low but that is largely fixed now. 

Hours used to be bad but this has got better."
5,New Starter After The Susan Fowler Blog,True,Moving from a non tech company to a tech one has been the best decision I have made.  Uber does not lie when they say they are fast paced and rapidly changing.  If you come with a confidence that you can contribute in your own way and are comfortable in pursuing those ambitions without needing to be checked each step of the way then this is the company for you.  If you feel you are not able to make a decisions without approval from someone else then you will struggle.,"I work away from San Francisco and the internal challenges Uber faces are more SF based.  The external challenges are more global.  You need to really believe in the current and long term goals of the company, you will question yourself and be questioned by others but you truely believe then you will become a great advocate for the change, both internal and external we are making."

5,Not flawless but hard to beat. Pros outweigh cons.,True,"- Access to some of the best minds around

- People managers that really support your growth and development

- Company puts in so much effort to communicate their effort &amp; take care of employees with extra unexpected benefits/compensation that most people didn't ask for

- Not just allowed to work remotely during the pandemic, remote work is required for as many as possible

- Global all hands is an opportunity to ask questions that get legitimate answers from exec leadership team and overwhelming feedback in this area or employee satisfaction surveys are addressed with new or altered policy. It sometimes takes a year or two but it is rarely left totally unaddressed.

- Perks of monthly Uber credits, for benefits there is parental leave is 16 weeks , unlimited PTO, mental healthcare is free

- Equity refreshes per year (always a carrot being waived in that sense)

- Yearly compensation review. I have received a significant % raise each year that I didn't personally ask for, so I appreciate that.

- A lot of internal promotion","- Pennywise and pound-foolish for costs, time, employee benefits, and prioritization

- Stock price is highly dependent on the news

- No 401k match

- Exec leadership often sends mass emails with empathetic but unnecessary commentary on current political/high-coverage news that does not concern the business.

- I have seen some borderline abusive/harrassing employees warned several times instead of being fired. They often leave on their own because they usually do not get promoted after several years. 

- Cyclical nature of focus on certain metrics

- Internal bureaucracy is more of a problem each year. Even after researching where to find certain info, my job is slowed down by having to contact X for input only to get redirected to Z team, who doesn't handle this particular issuetye, so contact Q team instead.

- Regularly have to reopen my IT tickets most of the time because they are usually not read properly the first time."

People are very smart and are always willing to work extra to make Uber a better platform.",What I have seen is people are pretty work oriented and don't really communicate much as a team (except for work related topics). Meetings are generally quiet and only talk about work and nothing else. Nobody shares their personal stories or experiences. Feels strictly like work! I can't really tell if it's same always because I have only started working after covid and have been WFH since the beginning.

Renewal date which is 1 Jan 2022 does not OVERLAP my previous insurance which was 31 Dec 2021. No where I. The world insurance companies are overlapping their policies when you are renewing your insurance."
5,"Fast paced environment, plenty of opportunity",True,"I work amazing people who work hard to solve really difficult problems

I learn loads every day, the pace is very fast!

I'm empowered to take ownership of problems and solve them day to day as well as with longer projects.

City Teams at Uber are small so you get to be part of everything - In one day you could be working on marketing, analytics, meeting with drivers, a press release, interviewing new staff, meeting an MP, or literally painting a wall at the office.","The taxi industry is putting up a pretty big fight, so this grinds you down sometimes. Yes, we all work very hard but there's flexibility around how it is done: you can work from home or cafe or whatever and make your own hours if you need to be somewhere personal."

Culture of innovation, best idea wins and helping each other no matter where in the world that person sits","Will be expected to work hard, but everyone is in control of their time - no face time culture. You will most likely go to bed and wake up thinking about Uber.



Fast past is not for everyone."
5,Operations and Logistics Manager,True,"The opportunity to succeed is yours. You are given amazing tools and the chance to make a real impact on a growing business. So it is really up to you.

2,This Company Does Not Care About You!,True,"-Lots of responsibility, power, impact given to lower-level employees (we were running multi-million dollar campaigns as L3s)

-Opportunity to try a lot of different types of projects and wear a lot of different hats, mostly because the company was pretty unstable and lacked resourcing","-Low opportunity for promotion - review cycles are 2x per year, and only about 10% of all people were expected to be promoted each time. Often not enough room for individuals to get promoted - e.g. L4s could not be promoted because no further L5 roles were available.

-Instability - the company is HIGHLY unstable. We went through 3 major reorgs during the span of 12 months. 

-Lack of people investment - people often see this company as a stepping stone, and that includes leadership. Leadership did not seem to really invest in their direct reports, from a professional development standpoint. This also was likely caused by the fact that we had so many re-orgs.

-Lack of focus on PD - there was overall very little focus on professional development at the company, which I often felt was de-prioritized in favor of driving the business. For example, SQL training for Ops POCs was cut due to budget cuts, leaving newer folks to have to use free online resources for trainings. There were no trainings or workshops outside of work in our org - it was really up to you to find these on your own.

-Highly disorganized - the company overall was highly disorganized, with many functions having overlapping scopes and not communicating well with each other. Unlike other companies, there were no PMO teams in place to ensure that teams were working well together and staying organized - it was up to the individual teams.

-Compensation - compensation was at least 15-25% lower than similar roles at other comparable companies. This was something often brought up during All-Hands, and dismissed by executive leadership.

-Culture - overall, it felt like people were very jaded at the company - each month, at least 3-4 people left the Ops org on average. People were tired of the reorgs, and tired of not being paid enough while being asked to work extremely hard, given our business was still unprofitable. It felt very unsustainable."

5,Uber is the best job I,True,"I get to problem solve every day with a super smart, driven team. We're empowered to make decisions, execute and share learnings. We're improving the cities that Uber operates in - it's exciting to come to work every single day!",Hours can be long but they go very fast! There aren't enough of them in the day.
5,Get in the thick of an international growth startup,True,"Lots of freedom; especially for the newer, international cities. Having come from a startup background I've had no trouble adjusting, just the right amount of oversight and high level goals combined with support from someone who has done it before. The pace of growth - this company grows month-on-month what most established companies do in a year. You'll learn how to scale first-hand

Super transparent. You can see everything. As a data-nerd this is amazing. The data is the single best reason for working at Uber.

Culture is awesome (for someone who's never done the whole silicon valley thing before, that's the experience you get). You are working with world-class talent. I've met a couple hundred people here, not one of them is a person I would not want to work with. People are passionate, smart and focused. Uber will make you a more capable employee, better entrepreneur and impart that ability to get the right sh*t done so no matter what you do or where you go next, you will be able to do it better.","Can be tough for detail oriented individuals. I'm borderline OCD (self-diagnosed!) and the engineer in me twitches every time I do the time-saved vs. time-taken trade-off in terms of ""Do I write a script to automate this?"" or ""Do I set up auto-calculate in this sheet"". Things are changing and scaling so rapidly that you'll need to be flexible on level of detail and really firm on making sure you use time as efficiently as possible

Time (again for the internationals); you will never have enough of it. For the international operational roles Uber is still very much in expansion mode and it will consume all of your waking hours. Expect to work... a lot. But for the right candidate this won't be a problem.

That goes for compensation as well. This isn't an amazing compensation package for the amount of work you do. If your sole metric is $ then this probably isn't the right role. If you want something engaging, consuming, amazing, frenetic and passionate then this is the job for you."
5,Great place to work,True,Love the work environment at uber,Would love to have more work from home
5,Potential,True,"You have a strong potential to create a solid foundation in your life, with a click of a button you can start earning 25-30$ per hour, depending on the area.

5,Do the best work for your life,True,"Uber is still growing ⬆️ at a fast rate for a large. As the company grows there is tremendous opportunity for upcoming engineers. There is flavor for all the types : Machine Learning, Backend, Frontend, Mobile, Cloud platform etc. 



The second awesome thing about Uber is its culture. It is very different from FAANG. At Uber the decisions are driven bottom up. As an engineer you have influence on roadmaps, innovations.



I also find Uber to be very inclusive 👩‍👩‍👦🏳️‍🌈👨‍👨‍👧‍👧 and working hard to attract and retain Under-represented groups. It has made public commitment to be an anti-racist company. 👏","On the con side, Uber's engineers and managers can do a better job at on-boarding new engineers."

When all expenses and depreciation to vehicle is included it’s a losing proposition

Front line support can do very little to resolve account issues

Waiting 20 days, can’t go online and all one gets is thank you for your patience, well get back to you when we have an update

20 days no update

Promised Supervisor callbacks never happened in 20 days

Absolutely no option to speak with anyone outside of their 3rd party callcentre"

- Great percs and benefits.

- Mostly helpful team leads/management in my department.","- Although I was awarded ""Support Superstar of the Week"" and had generally averaged pretty well on my stats and overall performance, I was turned down for the other positions I applied for. I enjoyed many conversations I had with drivers across the US, and loved helping where I could, but being on the phone all day having to meet metrics was very stressful for me. I even tried applying to a lower paying position and the recruiter who I'd had deny me for other positions kept telling me in the interview that he didn't want me to get bored and assuring me it would be a step down, I tried to express as clearly as I could that I wanted that and they still rejected me, and upon requesting feedback on the decision, none of it came from those who were involved but rather from other recruiters and HR telling me irrelevant information and also that I was doing well in my current role so it wouldn't make sense to move me to that role, even though I was burnt out, so I just walked out."

Many relatively-inexperienced managers across the company



Lack of clear direction from management, leading to half-baked projects and ideas

Inadequate/barely existent training for new hires in non-ops roles



No mentorship (people, especially new hires, are often left to figure things out on their own)



Office politics



Limited growth opportunities



Promotion process for certain roles feels unnecessarily tedious (why does it have to feel like applying for a new job?)



Employees seem to be either overworked or underutilized



Employees are seen as just a number - no one seems to care if someone is able to put their skills and experience to good use. If it works, great! If it doesn't, then they can just push you out of the company or find a replacement"
1,Gone downhill,True,Things have gone really downhill recently,Bad place to work now
4,Good first job,True,"If you live in California, Prop 22 benefits will help out on getting paid more, also, there are other benefits like insurance.

You can work anytime you want, but I suggest turning on the app during the afternoon on weekends.

The process of being a delivery driver is much easier and less of a hassle than being a regular uber driver.

Also, you're your own boss. Just know that there's a rating system on your performance based on customers' experience of you.","The app can be buggy sometimes. The display can be buggy sometimes, although that can be because my iPhone is old. 

Sometimes certain trip fares won't process in time (although it's far and few between, but watch out nonetheless).

Even with prop 22, you would have to work extra just to make a living out of it. If you want to make a living without a hassle, do regular Uber. This is more of a job if you're just 19 and going to college or if you're living under your parents' roof (or both) and you wanna make some extra money to either spend or save up.

Sometimes customers can be a bit vague on instructions. Just call or message them if you're having trouble. There are rare cases where I couldn't do anything but cancel the delivery. There was one time a customer gave me a cross street and the customer's phone was expired. There was nothing I can do except cancel the delivery. Thank god I get paid nontheless, but it was still frustrating."

- It's probably the least friendly company I've worked at although I have made some friends. Many people don't seem to value connecting for reasons other than work. This could also be because of covid."

2,Uber Eats has ZERO transparency for employees,True,None that outweigh the risks to life and vehicle,"No transparency in driver reviews. Drivers are rated poorly by customers without the ability to dispute the allegations and accusations. If your rating as a driver falls below 95% then you lose ALL opportunities for benefits to include, healthcare, vision, dental, discounts on vehicle maintenance. Uber Eats offers ZERO transparency for drivers who have received a bad rating/review. If there is no way of knowing why a customer left a bad rating/review, then there is no way for a driver to perform corrective action or redouble their efforts to provide better customer satisfaction. This creates a negative dynamic of working for Uber Eats. There is no way to improve service or dispute possible libel/slander/defamation of character perpetrated by customers. I am encouraging a class action lawsuit against Uber Eats if they refuse to operate within the U.S. Constitutional rights to face accusers. If we are to lose our benefits due to a statistically impossible uphill battle to increase our ratings without knowing what the specific complaints of the customer are or if they are even factually submitted, then we have a serious legal issue that needs to be corrected. Transparency of driver reviews needs to happen now or Uber Eats will find itself the defendant in a federal case. Drivers are unable to dispute bad reviews by providing evidence from app screenshots, dashcams, and other documented recordings. Drivers are losing their benefits due to having to wait at restaurants for too long to hand drivers the food, having to wait in traffic behind stop and go traffic due to vehicular collisions miles ahead (the app has not improved or evolved to divert away from slow traffic caused by vehicular collisions ahead). Drivers are at the mercy of lazy people that don't get food for themselves. Drivers put their lives at risk at every intersection to bring food to these lazy people for very little compensation.



If Uber Eats intends to continue operating within the U.S. then it needs to start adhering to U.S. law. We, as drivers in the U.S., need transparency of our negative reviews, not only to improve our service to create better customer satisfaction, but also to dispute any slanderous/libelous, defamation and accusations made by customers. If this does not happen there will eventually and inevitably be a massive class action lawsuit against Uber Eats to affect Freedom of Information. You cannot revoke employment benefits (health, dental, vision) without an appeals process to dispute allegations against drivers. It is unethical, immoral, and irresponsible. Uber Eats should know better. If these manipulative practices that harm their employees' health and restrict benefits based on non-appealable and a non-transparent review system are not confronted by corporate and CORRECTED to create a healthier dynamic, then Uber Eats will ultimately gain crippling negative attention when the massive class action lawsuit is brought at the federal level. I am giving Uber Eats a very short time-frame to confront this VERY SERIOUS issue. You have been put on notice. Create a transparent system for drivers to dispute and appeal negative reviews that are possibly libelous/slanderous. The positive outcome will be that drivers will know what their accusers claimed and improve service to make customers happier or dispute false accusations that lower the driver's rating causing wrongful loss of benefits. If our benefits are on the line and Uber Eats revokes them based on customer lies, then the dynamic is severely flawed and the lack of healthcare could cause unnecessary deaths.



Other Cons: 

1. Customers are instructed by Uber that it is NOT NECESSARY TO TIP. This is harmful to the livelihood of employee drivers.



2. Over 65% of deliveries that pop up in the app are absurdly substandard wages for the amount of time and miles to deliver the order. Most are over 20 minutes and 7 miles for less than $5. Only 24% of deliveries are on par with properly compensating drivers for risking their lives through dozens of intersections across many miles. I have my own acceptable delivery prerequisites to accept a delivery. If the delivery is more than 20 minutes to conduct then the minimum earnings I will accept is $7. I need to maintain the serviceability and the safe, proper function of my vehicle. I need to fill my vehicle with gas once a day. I put over 700 miles on my vehicle per week while working for Uber Eats and I am not anyone's slave. I will not subject myself to substandard wages or slavery. So note to customers, we turn down your slave-wage propositions to deliver your food.



3. Restaurants are almost never ready with the order. On average, it takes me 8 minutes to drive to the restaurant after accepting the order on the app. Some restaurants are ready with the order before I get there. My personal observation is that the majority of restaurants keep Uber delivery drivers waiting for more than 15 minutes. I had 7 deliveries tonight in which I waited for the restaurant to give me the order for delivery. The longest wait time I endured tonight was 33 minutes at a McDonalds. THAT IS NOT ""FAST FOOD"". The delivery from McDonald's to the customer took me 14 minutes. It only took me 7 minutes to get to the McDonald's from the time I accepted the delivery order. I made less than $8 that hour. That is less than minimum wage for the hour. You will not be compensated for long wait times at restaurants. You will lose time and money waiting for food. Uber doesn't do anything to fix this.



4. Uber Eats only employs people from India for their support/help hotline for drivers. The accents are ridiculously hard to understand. It's their way to save a buck by outsourcing jobs to foreigners at a fraction of the cost. It wastes driver's time whenever there is an issue that needs to be addressed and the majority of issues are inadequately addressed and rarely resolved.



5. Customers will give fake addresses or incomplete addresses that cost drivers valuable time and effort. The driver will try to reach out to the customer by phone or text and only half the time will the customer actually respond. When this occurs it causes drivers to lose valuable time for zero compensation.



6. Restaurants will provide Uber with phone numbers that are NOT accurate. When delivering late at night, drivers don't want to travel to a delivery pick-up only to find out the restaurant has closed for business for the day. Uber Eats does NOT remove erroneous deliveries due to restaurants being closed. When one driver gets there and marks the business as ""closed"" in the app, the app just cycles it to a different driver. Drivers try to contact the business to check if they're open only to get an error message stating that the number is not in service. This happens to me CONSTANTLY. I drive across town to a closed restaurant that I tried to call through the app with no response and receive ZERO compensation for spent fuel and time.



7. The Uber Eats app itself has many issues. Quotas are not accurately recorded. Tips are not accurately recorded. You literally have no accurate accounting of how many deliveries have contributed to your quota bonuses.



There are many more problems with driving for Uber Eats.

In summary, the biggest issue with Uber Eats is waving the promise of health benefits in the faces of drivers if they can stay above 95% customer satisfaction rating of their performance, but they have ZERO processes in place to appeal or dispute their reviews. This hurts Uber Eats whether or not they acknowledge it. If Uber Eats created a feedback system by which drivers could view every individual complaint/review, then Uber Eats drivers could improve their service accordingly or dispute false allegations by providing recorded evidence that disproves the claims against the driver.



Note: I personally have a GoPro concealed in my clothing, a dashcam in my car, and I screenshot every delivery from acceptance in-app to pickup at restaurant to driving to customer to the way I follow instructions in-app as well as every name associated with every address I deliver to. I RECORD EVERYTHING and in the state of Texas this is LEGAL. Texas is a single-party consent state in which everything can be recorded and used as evidence in court. I have compiled over 2,000 hours of camera recorded content into a dedicated hard-drive. If I had the ability to face my accusers that gave me a poor rating/review and addressed their claims with my own physical evidence, then Uber Eats would have to nullify the vast majority of negative reviews against me, thus reinstating my well deserved benefits."

Their leadership teams are inexperienced, (borderline incompetent,) and lack empathy for their staff. They engage in practices such as workplace bullying, retaliation for reports to HR, blatant fraternization (amongst leadership and subordinates,) and favoritism as a result. The high performers are not rewarded for the hard work, and promotions and manger references are granted only to those who get along with them on a social level. If you make a complaint, favor will automatically fall on the members of the leadership team and those they engage with outside of work.



The company's branches, (engineering, community operations, executive, etc.) operate completely independently of each other, and the comm ops branch is treated like dirt. If you work in the Greenlight Hub you can pretty much expected to be treated like a second class citizen. They even opted to stay open during an active stay at home advisory (after a spike in covid-19 infections) in Chicago, while their other branches were allowed to work safe from home.



While Uber boasts being a ""diverse"" company, their own recent report showed that most of the positions in leadership and tech at the company are filled by white men. Black and latino employees are still underrepresented in almost every sector of this company outside of customer support."

1,Modern Day Exploitation,True,Can make a barely livable wage if you work really hard and know what you're doing.,"The company, specifically talking about the corporate leadership, and especially its algorithm actively work to thread a fine line between legality and exploitation. Very often find themselves on the wrong side of that line but survive because most employees do not have the time/resources to launch a lawsuit.



Also I am a full time driver who has over 800 trips and a 4.94 rating. I occasionally get texts/emails saying their system has detected improper use when I get close to completing promotions, and that continuing to do this may result in deactivation. Needless to say I have never done any of the things they list in their little mafia threat. I call them up and get no information on what triggered it and have to deal with a poor soul who is probably working hard just like me to make ends meet. And all they are able to tell me is that everything looks 'correct'. 



In my opinion, anybody in the company who goes to work in a suit, and does not actively participate in improving the app/algorithm, and attends meetings to make 'decisions' about where the company should go, should go."

3,Broken Talent Management and Recruiting,True,"Uber is a place where you can learn and grow a tremendous amount in a short period of time. They have some of the best engineers I've worked with and a very low-friction environment for getting things done. Some colleagues complain about some of the extra process and bureaucracy but relative to 99% of all other organizations this size, it really is a 1st world problem. During my tenure here, a was blown away by the sheer scale of the software and the systems used to power it from behind the curtains. I was given the opportunity to do Big Data and work on some of the components of their micro-service architecture. Having colleagues who were as capable and competent didn't hurt.



Uber is a very dynamic organization and they still move fast. They have been working hard to simplify complexity so teams can move even faster without sacrificing quality. In the time I was there, I was able to successfully ship several major features globally and establish myself quickly on the team. Never a boring moment.","Uber's recruiting process and talent management is broken. Having said all the above, if you join Uber in the wrong role forget about getting this addressed in a timely or even fair manner. You'll pretty much get the standard management runaround without any promises. In my case I applied for a specific role and was offered a different role which I was told happens quite frequently. After a year to 18 months I would be considered for the new role I originally applied for. Trusting that they knew the challenges better than I did, I decided to give it a chance but upon joining realized that the role offered was not going to be what I thought it was. Speaking with senior and executive leadership did not lead to any substantive steps being taken to expedite the process or adjust my responsibilities. I am a very senior individual and this was a very hard situation to be in given I had left a high-caliber organization to take on this opportunity. I chalk this up to a broken recruiting process that fails to properly assess a candidates strengths particularly if they come from an industry outside of tech and implicit interviewer bias. Talent management is also quite inflexible. Having raised my concerns multiple times with management there were no attempts to come up with even a compromise solution that would have modified my role to provide some of the responsibilities I sought."

4,It Was Ok,True,They actually listen to their employees and try to make positive changes. The executive leadership is fairly transparent with the company. You have regular performance evaluations and check ins with your boss.,As the years go on at Uber the company becomes more of a corporate giant. The flexibility in how you do your job basically evaporated totally and there are roadblocks in place to prevent you from moving on to a new role. Essentially as a Team Lead the only position readily available to you is a Manager. The other divisions of the company dont recruit in Greenlight because your skills are considered to be different than theirs.

5,Legit a good place to work,True,"I've had so many terrible jobs in the past, some so toxic it's caused severe health issues. So I know the red flags to look for when it comes to terrible companies. Honestly I can say Uber is great place to work. They actually listen to the employees and do their best to make sure we're comfortable &amp; have a real work /life balance. The benefits are amazing. So far the my colleagues are very helpful and decent to work with. I'm not naïve so I know no place is perfect. But at least here at Uber you will feel heard and respected.","One con I can say is, we need better resources to help the drivers and delivery partners that work on the platform. I don't feel they're being heard enough. Also there needs to be clear and concise communication between phone support &amp; support at the Greenlight Hubs. Too many times drivers have came upset and confused because the information given over the phone is different from what's given in person. And no I'm not a Uber driver or Uber eats delivery person either.. I'm just speaking from experience dealing with them on a daily basis."

5,nice,True,its great working with uber.,some days you get less orders.
5,One of the best companies that a fresher could work for.,True,"The most striking feature of Uber is its support of intrapreneurship among its employees; The management encourages its employees to take initiative and allows them to take full responsibility and subsequent credit for their ideas.



Career growth; There is tremendous potential to grow one's career in the company. Employees get ample opportunities to learn new skills, work on projects, and ultimately, move to roles that appeal to them. 



The work culture is very team-oriented. My team leads and managers were very approachable, supportive, and insightful. My mentors were incredibly helpful and were instrumental in understanding the technical know-how of the job. 



All the employees are given access to a plethora of benefits; Free food, free transport, Uber credits, Wellness allowance that can be redeemed for personal care, gym memberships, and more, the list goes on.



All of the above factors contribute to an exceptional work-life balance that reflects the company's ethos.",None that I can think of.

4,Working at Uber,True,"international network, trainings, good benefits, working with smart people","no work life balance, leadership bias, hard to move up the ladder if not in central teams"
4,My personal experience,True,Extra monthly credits and well-being benefits,a lot of office politics and fewer growth opportunities
3,Poor experience,True,"Great benefits, real projects to work on, a lot of growth opportunities","No work life balance, Poor onboarding, Not an inclusive workplace"
3,Welcome to the Frat House,True,"Great to work with the technology. Really got me motivated and in the office early, which really makes everything else that much easier. (mostly) Great group of people. It was a great experience to be all in on a project. For real! Not just what you said to get the job.","Management was void! Nobody knew how or wanted to know how to make a decision. They thinly veiled this fact with a pre-emptive ""Things change constantly so what happened yesterday may not happen tomorrow"" So what you ended up with was a few cliches that each had their own idea about what day to day was going to look like. I have never worked anywhere where an employee in a position above me complained about another employee as annoying or refer to another group as less than tolerable like at Uber ATG. It was Lord of the Flies meets Animal House. As a social experiment the job was a microcosm of the fall of the western civilization. So I have mixed feelings about it, I really - really - really wish upper management would have seen this, stepped in and given the crew direction. With a little focus things could have been amazing, instead the office in Tempe self-destructed within a year. 



It was NOT a place where you wanted to tell your team lead that you just had a unsafe interaction with other vehicles in public. I know because I made the mistake of trying to always inform the lead if anything questionable happened. My mistake! A slight infraction would turn into an eminent disaster and a case for execution would be made. Of course not everybody was subject to the same rules. Some of the things other people were doing were careless for the sake of being careless yet as far as I know that was not something of concern. It is not surprising what happened in 2018 happened. Safety was more a tool to keep employees in line rather than an ethic. The similarity between work at Uber ATG Tempe and Lord of the Flies is uncanny.



From what I have seen and what I hear, things in Pittsburgh are awesome, the Tempe issues were not relevant. Which, for me, means that working in Pitt would be a dream job! And I highly suggest it, Tempe is gone so this review is just me venting. Thanks for reading."

Internal quality procedures are lacking tremendously, to the point even the absolute best agents who are incredibly talented and knowledgeable get told they are not good enough week after week.

A ton of contention between different sides of the business (Rides, Eats, Freight, etc). The company tries to do the right thing but will only do the bare minimum to to remain in public favor. It might have been different on other teams but this is the kind of place where people will message you instead of having a face to face conversation.

I am surrounded by brilliant people working on complex, ambiguous problems, yet despite the fast-pace of work and change at Uber, everyone is really open and willing to spare some time to help with a task or jam on the topic at hand. For being such an established player, Uber still feels very much like a startup - every work day is unique and the challenges I face require critical thinking and designing my own frameworks for how to approach them.

There is tremendous opportunity to ""choose your own adventure"" within the company, with just the right amount of guardrails around my role &amp; responsibilities, and plenty of freedom to pursue opportunities I find interesting.

Management is also extremely transparent - with biweekly company all-hands meetings including 30 minutes for Q&amp;A from anyone from the company. This was a huge breath of fresh air coming from my last company.","Though everyone at the firm is very competent and helpful, the company has grown very fast and has gone through a lot of personnel change since its inception. Processes and projects have not always been documented very consistently, so it can sometimes be difficult to find some of the information I need.

1,WORST COMPANY TO GET BACK TO AND VERY UNPROFESSIONAL PEOPLE WITH NO HEART!!!!!,True,With my experience NONE.... I have lost all trust and admiration with this organization,"I was among the many employees that were retrenched by Uber due to the pandemic and of course, we accepted as it is a companywide decision and there is really nothing that we can do, but we were given the hope that one day we can all go back and be part of the organization that we have worked with before. After more or less a year an opening came up and I gladly re appled for the position and went through all the application process including exams, interviews and providing all necessary details to be hired and luckily I did get hired and was already given a start date when I would be back to the company. But after a few weeks my recruitment point person did not get back to me anymore and when I followed up I was given the run around until the day of my start date and a day after that I was told they will not hire me anymore and I was not given any reason WHY. That is just so unprofessional and really devastated me and my plans and everything that I have hoped for. Uber will really stab you in the back if they can. I have filed a local labor case here in still they would not assist me in what happened and hopefully they get what they deserve."
4,"Good Autonomy, but business success is a challenge",True,"fast-paced, a lot of autonomy","The company can feel disorganized and lacking strategic direction, making it uncertain whether or not the business will actually take off in Japan."

2,How was this real?,True,"I got to think I was a part of some ""movement"" for about three months","Got paid less than a living wage with no experience to talk to assault victims. The benefits? An extravagant vision insurance plan and catered lunches that only had undercooked meat 5 times in two years. Sick time from food poisoning on company property was deducted regardless. Fun staff, run by ex cops who push you out if they don't agree with your decisions. Also got used as a poster figure for diversity efforts on a team where no one used my pronouns correctly. What's the point here?"
5,Food Delivery,True,Flexibility with god fare and tips.,"Slow days, months are less busy than others."
5,Driver,True,Lots of hours and money,Restaurants take long sit around waiting
2,Join Uber if you wish to be stuck in what should be a salaried role as an hourly employee forever,True,"Near constant trial by fire is great bonding with your immediate team members, the health benefits are admittedly great, and you can leverage your experience from this role into a company that will pay you almost double for the same work.","The CommOps org is broken into two tiers of employees that lead to the lower tier being treated like second class cities - the L-ladder, which primarily includes Managers and up, and the S-ladder, which includes anyone else below a lower level manager role. 



While this is industry standard in customer facing service roles, supporting project based roles such as content project specialist, quality project specialists, and lower tiers of analysts are not traditionally paid hourly based on the nature of the work done and the responsibilities. The team maintains a high attrition rate for the following reasons: 



- Low pay. The role's responsibilities are more equivalent to an assistant project manager, but with the pay of an experienced support agent. Your responsibilities include designing the support process and tailoring the message of the company's projects, tracking down stakeholders and managing reviews to ensure it's ready for launch. 



- Low career opportunities. A select few have made the jump into operations style roles, but it's despite their work on the content for those teams, not because of it. This is a three part issue: 

1. The org that develops content is separate from the team that asks for content, so there are no promotional roles your work can leverage into based on your stakeholder engagement and expansion of responsibilities. 

2. You're gatekept from the results of your work, so despite working alone to audit, redevelop, and launch content, of which the scope of responsibility is 100% in your hands outside of providing final approval, you'll rarely if ever receive information or have access to the data to allow you to pull that information yourself to know what impact it had. 

3. Which leads to the issue of the fact that Uber requires every role to be applied to, no exceptions. You're paid hourly, so you have the stigma from the rest of the company that assumes the position is more just writing words and less end-to-end content ownership and management going into the application. From there, you have to battle to prove you have the experience to be in your next role, which is incredibly hard to do when you have no access to what impact your work has on the overall company.



- Overwork and burnout - They haven't been able to hire up to the level they need to to handle the amount of work coming in, but Senior Management will punish you anyways through low performance bonuses (which HR points to as the reason why their low pay actually is the same as roles in other companies that pay 20k more) and scolding for not being able to make it through everything assigned to your plate. You're simultaneously not supposed to take overtime because it impacts the team budget, but you're also supposed to clear everything off your plate, even when you communicate you have no bandwidth to take anything else on and meet your deadlines. 



- Management is very much a ""stop complaining"" style, than a ""We'll set better boundaries with other stakeholders and adhere to our actual role responsibilities so you're not overextended and can actually complete what's on your plate."""
1,Don’t work here,True,"Great Benefits, health, medical insurance and unlimited PTO","Where to start?!

Hired in September 2021, after 2 months they changed the compensation structure. They reduced the salary by 40%. I felt cheated and betrayed because I transitioned from my previous job because of the higher salary. They also changed the quota and it became not on closing accounts (although am an account executive) the quota was on the first delivery of the restaurant you signed and the revenue that the restaurant brings. They expect you close the deal and sell the promotions and marketing that the account managers are supposed to do. This is an inside sales job but they want you to go outside all the time. They have terrible customer service and they don’t care about the merchants (restaurants) 

The leaders (not really leaders) they are only trying to hype things up when there is a success story but you don’t hear them when they do something wrong. They get silent as if they can’t be responsible enough for their wrong management. 

The top performers are being fed accounts by the management. So they out perform everybody else. The chance of you doing great depends on your manager, location and book of business. Also the quota keeps on changing (increasing) although half of the floor are not hitting the quota. But the management don’t care because they are not going to pay the commission.

In summary, they act if they care and if they are a good company but they are not. At least in the Midwest team."

4,Amazing benefits and work environment,True,"Good to put on resume

benefits are good pay not so good",Pay not as per market rate
2,TLDR; think twice,True,"Good benefits



Pay is competitive



Generous Uber credits every month



Choice of Mac or Windows computer



Dynamic Google Suite instead of Office","Extremely high turnover, creates roadblocks to moving forward with projects. I waited for two months for someone to return from vacation and sabbatical only to be told they were now leaving the company. I saw this trend happen multiple times in addition to being told suddenly that a person I talked to last week had since left Uber. Red flag when it’s joked that being with the company for two years makes you a “dinosaur.”



Each team you work with has their own set of priorities that usually differs from your teams, making accomplishing assigned goals or launches extremely difficult. No person will have the same general grasp of an initiative and often I found things I was assigned to were being completely deprecated or deprioritized by the team I needed to work with



Upper management is out of reach. My manager’s manager rarely reached out to me directly and instead deployed someone on my team to relay their messages



There is little to no onboarding or development, in addition to job definition being extremely ambiguous and ever-shifting. My team went through two major name and org changes in a matter of months, and the programs I was assigned to were constantly in limbo of being completely altered for priority and rollout. I received little definition from my manager on how to get around in my day-to-day, ie where to access commonly-used resources and had to learn almost everything instant immersion style. This is not the best when you’re trying to establish yourself with multiple teams. 



For me, the young start-up culture that I initially thought would be a refreshing ‘pro’ turned quickly to a ‘con.’ For a while I heard everyone (not an exaggeration) say ‘TLDR,’ and eventually had to look it up. For anyone like me you’ll be puzzled to learn that this means ‘too long, didn’t read.’ Upper upper management uses the phrase and it’s peppered in to everything— presentations, emails, documents. For me I cringe reading and hearing it because any of the companies I worked for before would have seriously questioned why I’m implying someone wouldn’t read what’s being mentioned in entirety. I find it off-putting but the broad majority I worked with embraced it- enough said for me to know this is not the right place for me."

The leadership, particularly in CommOps has become super toxic and political. It got worse after September 2021.  Processes are dysfunctional, roles ambiguous, it is very dog eat dog.  Attrition is through the roof and expected to get worse as people just don’t see the point in sticking around.
