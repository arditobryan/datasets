A set of access logs associated with a system are analyzed in order to generate a restricted access policy for an over privileged system identity. An initial access policy of the system identity is replaced with the restricted access policy and a continuous monitoring and access management (CMAM) service is initiated. Access logs are collected for a monitoring time window and an access denied error can be extracted from the access logs. The access denied error can be compared to an ignore list and/or the access denied error can be added to the ignore list. Authorization checks can be performed to determine if the action associated with the access denied error is authorized. If the action is authorized, the access policy is adjusted to allow for performance of the action.

Safe vertical take-off and landing aircraft payload distribution and adjustment,"February 9, 2021",1091352,"Vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft can provide opportunities to incorporate aerial transportation into transportation networks for cities and metropolitan areas. However, VTOL aircraft can be sensitive to uneven weight distributions, e.g., the payload of an aircraft is primarily loaded in the front, back, left, or right. When the aircraft is loaded unevenly, the center of mass of the aircraft may shift substantially enough to negatively impact performance of the aircraft. Thus, in turn, there is an opportunity that the VTOL may be loaded unevenly if seating, luggage placement, and/or positions of internal components are not coordinated. Among other advantages, dynamically assigning the payloads and adjusting components of the VTOL aircraft can increase VTOL safety by ensuring the VTOL aircraft is loaded evenly and meets all weight requirements; can increase transportation efficiency by increasing rider throughput; and can increase the availability of the VTOL services to all potential riders.

In a first stage, scene geometry is exploited and the multi-dimensional problem is reduced down to a one-dimensional (1D) problem. Entrance hypotheses are generated by considering pairs of locations along lines exhibiting strong gradients in the transverse direction. In a second stage, a rich set of discriminative image features for entrances is explored according to constructed designs, specifically focusing on properties such as symmetry and color consistency, for example. Classifiers (e.g., random forest) are utilized to perform automatic feature selection and entrance classification. In another stage, a joint model is formulated in three dimensions (3D) for entrances on a given facade, which enables the exploitation of physical constraints between different entrances on the same facade in a systematic manner to prune false positives, and thereby select an optimum set of entrances on a given facade.

The system determines the value estimate by identifying a sequence of time periods, each time period having an associated set of geographical regions. Possible transitions between geographical regions in different time periods are analyzed, for example, using statistical or machine-learned models, to determine likelihoods that the user will move between the geographical regions from one time period to another, and to determine expected values for a transition. Such models may be trained or developed using historical service data and user profile data stored by the system. Transitions are analyzed over a sequence of time periods to determine accumulated values associated with estimated overall values for each geographical region. The system predicts an overall value estimate for the user based on the accumulated values.

To verify that the data samples accurately indicate the location or movement of the provider, the network system can generate a test embedding representing the data samples and compare the test embedding with a reference embedding. The reference embedding is generated based on data samples captured for other similar services, e.g., corresponding to providers who also provided transportation services along the same particular route.

The system can determine, for each image frame, whether individual regions of the image frame depict drivable space. The system can do so using machine-learned image recognition algorithms such as convolutional neural networks generated using extensive training data. Using such techniques, the system can label regions of the image frames as corresponding to drivable space or non-drivable space. By analyzing the labeled image frames, the system can determine whether the vehicle is likely to impact a region of non-drivable space. And, in response to such a determination, the system can generate control signals that override other control systems or human operator input to control the brakes, the steering, or other sub-systems of the vehicle to avoid the collision.

Lidar-based classification of object movement,"January 16, 2018",987051,"Within machine vision, object movement is often estimated by applying image evaluation techniques to visible light images, utilizing techniques such as perspective and parallax.

Instead, lidar data may be available (e.g., for object avoidance in automated navigation), and may serve as a high-precision data source for such determinations. Respective lidar points of a lidar point cloud may be mapped to voxels of a three-dimensional voxel space, and voxel clusters may be identified as objects. The movement of the lidar points may be classified over time, and the respective objects may be classified as moving or stationary based on the classification of the lidar points associated with the object. This classification may yield precise results, because voxels in three-dimensional voxel space present clearly differentiable statuses when evaluated over time.

System and method for providing dynamic supply positioning for on-demand services,"June 23, 2015",906620,"A method for providing on-demand service information is provided. One or more processors determine, for a given geographic region, position information for each of a plurality of requesters for an on-demand service and position information for each of a plurality of service providers that can provide the on-demand service. A plurality of sub-regions is identified for the given geographic region. Based, at least in part, on the position information of the requesters and the service providers, one or more sub-regions are determined as being under-supplied by the plurality of service providers as compared to one or more other sub-regions. Information identifying the under-supplied sub-regions are provided to one or more service provider devices.

DYNAMICALLY PROVIDING POSITION INFORMATION OF A TRANSIT OBJECT TO A COMPUTING DEVICE,"May 8, 2014",2014012913,"A system and method for providing position information of a transit object to a computing device is provided. Global positioning satellite (GPS) information of a transit object can be periodically received. For each of some of the GPS information, one or more candidate points of a transit system can be identified based on the GPS information. Using the one or more candidate points, a most likely path of travel can be determined. Additional position points along the most likely path of travel can be extrapolated and transmitted to a computing device.
