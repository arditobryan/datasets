Pick-up/drop-off zone handoff between autonomous vehicles,"May 3, 2022",1132027,"Aspects of the present disclosure include systems, methods, and devices to facilitate pick-up/drop-off zone (PDZ) handoffs between autonomous vehicles. Consistent with some embodiments, a pick-up/drop-off zone (PDZ) is located based on detecting a first autonomous vehicle stopped at a stopping location. A system determines, based on one or more criteria, whether to request the first autonomous vehicle to remain stopped at the stopping location to create an opportunity for a second autonomous vehicle to claim the PDZ. An amount of time for the first autonomous vehicle to remain stopped at the stopping location is determined based on the one or more criteria. A request to remain stopped at the stopping location is transmitted to a vehicle autonomy system of the first autonomous vehicle based on satisfaction of the one or more criteria. The request specifies the amount of time for the first autonomous vehicle to remain at the stopping location.

Illegal stopping zone avoidance system,"April 12, 2022",1129917,"Systems and methods for avoiding illegal stopping zones are provided. In example embodiments, a networked system identifies a destination of a driver providing a transportation service to a user. The networked system monitors a user device of the driver, and infers, based on the monitoring, that the driver is planning to stop in an illegal stopping zone located a predetermined distance to the destination. The inference is based on device data such as accelerometer data or location data that is triangulated with known or derived illegal stopping zones. In response, the networked system causes presentation of a notification on a user interface of the device of the driver. The notification provides an indication of the illegal stopping zone. In some embodiments, the notification also provides an alternative stopping location determined by the networked system.
