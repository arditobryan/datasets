2334,"I'll post more as I learn more. You can disagree with any of this, but I sent these to three text chains of Gen Z and they  said ""holy shit"", ""spot on"", and ""I'm obsessed"". 

See you on @tiktok_us. I'll be the one singing AI songs.

*Opinions are my own, not employer*",1,1,39,1
2335,"11) TikTok is so far from a lipsyncing app. The platform itself is closer to WeChat than I think most people realize. Gen Z uses it to plan vacations (""I used it to find 'trendy' things to do in NYC""), make friends, shop, pick a major, you name it.",1,0,15,0
2336,"10) TikTok is not a social platform, it's a socializing platform. Largely because of the ""for you page"", users seem to follow strangers more than friends (at an estimated 15:1 ratio). Your feed is not just your friends, it's your future friends.",1,0,29,0
2337,"9) TikTok is multi-sensory and shows the power of audio, in a way other platforms haven't. I would assume 99% of TikTok users know the song ""Electric Love"". Trends range from transition style to track to editing style to meme to topics...you name it.",1,0,17,0
2338,"8) TikTok users are very algorithm-aware. More than any other platform. Lots of “commenting to stay on ___ TikTok” and lots of talk about “less attractive” people getting deprioritized in feeds. Users understand they're customizing their own algos.

*This is the biggest insight*",3,4,62,1
2339,"7) TikTok has something for everyone. This isn’t unique to TikTok. But it’s just SO VAST. And just when you think you’ve got it, search a hashtag for a foreign city you’re interested in visiting. Or your favorite college class. Scroll for 5 minutes.",1,0,9,0
2340,6) Creating TikTok content can be so time-intensive. There was one video of a girl with 20+ “transitions” changing hoodies (cooler than I’m describing). It probably took her 3 hours to make. Next level. Gen Z is insanely talented and wildly creative.,1,0,23,0
2341,"5) TikTok posts are RAW. And that's a good thing. People are crying, people are drunk and crying, people are hurt and crying, it’s a lot of crying. And they post it. And MILLIONS watch and support them. ""Protect her at all costs!""",1,0,22,0
2342,"4) TikTok comments are some of the funniest I’ve ever read. Better than FB &amp; IG combined. It’s hard to go to sleep after watching, laughing too hard. Including the “it’s the _____ for me” trend and one comment that said, “How is this app FREE?” following a hilarious video.",1,0,18,0
2343,"3) TikTok comments LIFT YOU UP. Might just be my feed or maybe top voted comments, but (w/ some exceptions) it is a body-positive place with boys learning to sew, doctors sharing statistics, and parents loving their children. Gen Z friends: ""p positive for the most part""",1,0,31,0
2344,"2) Their recommendation feed doesn’t pigeonhole you like other apps. They target your *every facet*. Which makes it more addictive. Oh... You’re a recently-coupled, country-loving, Kpop-dancing, beauty pageant dropout who loves interior design? Coolcool. That’s your feed.",1,0,33,0
